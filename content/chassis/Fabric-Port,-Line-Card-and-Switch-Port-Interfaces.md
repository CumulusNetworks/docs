Each line card in the CX-10256-S/OMP-800 chassis contains 64 100G ports,
broken down into 32 switch ports, which connect to an external network,
and 32 fabric ports, which connect to the fabric cards. Because each
line card has two Tomahawk ASICs, each line card actually is two
switches. One ASIC is on the "A" side of the line card and one is on the
"B" side.

Each side of the line card has half of the switch ports and half of the
fabric ports. The A side swp ports are numbered swp1-swp16 and the B
side swp ports are numbered swp17-swp32, which matches the physical port
labeling on the front of the line card.

However, Cumulus Linux sees the fabric ports as fp0, fp1 and so on until
fp15 on both sides of the line card.

Like the line cards, each fabric card is actually two switches, with an
A side and a B side; the A side is the side that contains the RJ45
Ethernet management port. Each side of the fabric card contains 32 100G
fabric ports, named fp0 through fp31.

Cumulus Linux and FRR commands interact with fabric port interfaces as
they would with any switch port interface.

You cannot break out the fabric ports into 4x25G, 2x50G, 1x40G or 4x10G
ports, while you can break out the switch ports to 2x50G, 4x25G, 1x40G
or 4x10G as desired.

The fabric ports are configured and brought up automatically. Their
configuration is 100G, full-duplex and MTU 9216, with auto-negotiation
off. The configuration is stored in the
`/etc/network/interfaces.d/fabric.intf` file.

## Internal Network

All chassis CPUs are connected via an internal management network
comprising a number of 1G switches. This configuration provides a single
external connection to access the eth0 interface on every CPU in the
fabric.

VLAN 4088 is internal to the chassis and is used for chassis management.
Traffic over this VLAN is never forwarded out of the chassis. An
eth0.4088 interface is created with IPv4 and IPv6 link local addresses
that are based on card type (line or fabric) and slot number; however,
IPv6 is of marginal value because they are link local addresses. Entries
for these addresses are written to the `/etc/hosts` file by a
`firstboot` script:

    cumulus@chassis-lc202:~$ cat /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1 localhost
    ::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
