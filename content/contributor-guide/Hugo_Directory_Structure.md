When you clone the Cumulus Networks docs repository, notice it contains the following
directories:

- /content
  - This directory contains all of the Markdown files for all the pages and their
    enclosing folders. 
  - Its arrangement determines the structure and hierarchy of the final site.
  - If you are modifying any content, all of your contributions will be to the 
    files located here.
- /static
  - Holds any static files like images and PDFs.
  - If you are adding an image, put it in the appropriate directory here.
  - Published to the site at /.

Modifying any of the following files will have significant impact on the overall
appearance and functioning of the site, so only consider making changes to these
files if you are a Hugo/Markdown expert!
