Welcome to the Cumulus Networks documentation contributor guide!

All of the technical user documentation for Cumulus Linux, Cumulus NetQ, Cumulus Express and our other products, are now included in a public-facing GitHub repository. This enables you to provide suggestions for improvements and new content using a GitHub workflow.

This guide explains how to setup a local environment with the needed tools, guidelines for writing in Markdown, and how to submit those changes for approval and inclusion in the documentation set.
