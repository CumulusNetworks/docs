Welcome to the Cumulus Networks documentation contributor guide!

All of the technical user documentation for [Cumulus Linux](/cumulus-linux/),
[Cumulus NetQ](/cumulus-netq/), [Cumulus VX](/cumulus-vx/) and our other products
are now included in a public-facing 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/docs). 
This enables you to provide suggestions for improvements and even create new content 
using a GitHub workflow.

This guide explains how to set up a local environment with the needed tools, guidelines
for writing in Markdown, and how to submit those changes for approval and inclusion in
the documentation set.

## Prerequisites

In order to contribute to the Cumulus Networks documentation, you need:

- A GitHub account and familiarity with [submitting pull requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
- A general understanding of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
  the formatting language used to write the documentation.

## Get Started

The fastest way to get started is to edit existing content:

1. Click the **Edit this page** link in the upper right corner of any documentation
   page. This takes you to the editor for that page on GitHub.
1. When you finish editing the page, scroll to the bottom of the page under
   **Commit changes**.
1. Type a summary and description of the changes you made.
1. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.** and
   enter the name of your branch.
1. Click **Propose file change**. This submits a pull request for the documentation
   team to review, and, if approved, to merge the pull request and publish your edits.

However, if you want to create new content, read [Adding New Content](/contributor-guide/Adding_New_Content/).
