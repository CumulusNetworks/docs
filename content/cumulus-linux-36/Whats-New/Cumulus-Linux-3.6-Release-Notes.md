## Licensing

Cumulus Linux is licensed on a per-instance basis. Each network system
is fully operational, enabling any capability to be utilized on the
switch with the exception of forwarding on switch panel ports. Only eth0
and console ports are activated on an un-licensed instance of Cumulus
Linux. Enabling front panel ports requires a license.

You should have received a license key from Cumulus Networks or an
authorized reseller. To install the license, read the {{<link url="Quick-Start-Guide">}}.

## Installing Version 3.6

If you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or later, use {{<exlink url="https://wiki.debian.org/apt-get" text="apt-get">}} to update the software.

Cumulus Networks recommends you use the `-E` option with `sudo` whenever
you run any `apt-get` command. This option preserves your environment
variables, such as HTTP proxies, before you install new packages or
upgrade your distribution.

1.  Retrieve the new version packages: `cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update`
2.  If you are using any {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/knowledge-base/Support/Support-Offerings/Early-Access-Features-Defined/" text="early access features">}} from an older release, remove them with: `cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get remove EA_PACKAGENAME`
3.  Upgrade the release: `cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get upgrade`
4.  To include additional Cumulus Linux packages not present in your current version, run the command: `cumulus@switch:~$ apt-get install nclu hostapd python-cumulus-restapi linuxptp` 

    If you already have the latest version of a package installed, you see messages similar to: `nclu is already the newest version`. You might also see additional packages being installed due to dependencies.
5.  Reboot the switch: `cumulus@switch:~$ sudo reboot`

{{%notice note%}}

If you see errors for expired GPG keys that prevent you from upgrading packages when upgrading to Cumulus Linux 3.6 from 3.5.1 or earlier, follow the steps in {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/knowledge-base/Installing-and-Upgrading/Upgrading/Update-Expired-GPG-Keys/" text="Upgrading Expired GPG Keys">}}.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice note%}}

In Cumulus Linux 3.6.0, the upgrade process has changed. During an upgrade to 3.6.0 from 3.5 or earlier, certain services might be stopped. These services are not restarted until after the switch reboots, which results in some functionality being lost during the upgrade process.

{{%/notice%}}

During the upgrade, you will see messages similar to the following:

    /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d returned 101, not running 'stop switchd.service'
    /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d returned 101, not running 'start switchd.service'

At the end of the upgrade, if a reboot is required, you see the following message:

    *** Caution: Service restart prior to reboot could cause unpredictable behavior
    *** System reboot required ***

**Do not restart services manually until after rebooting**, or services will fail.

For upgrades post 3.6.0, if no reboot is required after the upgrade completes, the upgrade will stop and restart all upgraded services and will log messages in the `/var/log/syslog` file similar to the ones shown below. (In the examples below, only the `frr` package was upgraded.)

    Policy: Service frr.service action stop postponed
    Policy: Service frr.service action start postponed
    Policy: Restarting services: frr.service
    Policy: Finished restarting services
    Policy: Removed /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d
    Policy: Upgrade is finished

For additional information about upgrading, see {{<link url="Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux" text="Upgrading Cumulus Linux">}}.

### New Install or Upgrading from Versions Older than 3.0.0

If you are upgrading from a version older than 3.0.0, or installing
Cumulus Linux for the first time, download the {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/downloads/" text="Cumulus Linux 3.6.0 installer">}} for Broadcom or Mellanox switches from the Cumulus Networks website, then use {{<exlink url="http://onie.github.io/onie/" text="ONIE">}} to perform a complete install, following the instructions in the {{<link url="Quick-Start-Guide">}}.

{{%notice note%}}

This method is **destructive**; any configuration files on the switch are **not** saved; copy them to a different server before upgrading via ONIE.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice note%}}

After you install, run `apt-get update`, then `apt-get upgrade` on your switch to make sure you update Cumulus Linux to include any important or other package updates.

### Updating a Deployment that Has MLAG Configured

If you are using {{<link url="Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG" text="MLAG">}} to dual connect two switches in your environment, and those switches are still running Cumulus Linux 2.5 ESR or any other release earlier than 3.0.0, the switches will not be dual-connected after you upgrade the first switch. To ensure a smooth upgrade, follow these steps:

1.  Disable `clagd` in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file (set `clagd-enable` to *no*), then restart the `switchd`, networking, and FRR services.  

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart switchd.service
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart networking.service
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart frr.service

2.  If you are using BGP, notify the BGP neighbors that the switch is going down:  

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh -c "config t" -c "router bgp" -c "neighbor X.X.X.X shutdown"

3.  Stop the Quagga (if upgrading from a version earlier than 3.2.0) or
    FRR service (if upgrading from version 3.2.0 or later):  

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl stop [quagga|frr].service 

4.  Bring down all the front panel ports:  

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ip link set swp<#> down

5.  Run `cl-img-select -fr` to boot the switch in the secondary role
    into ONIE, then reboot the switch.

6.  Install Cumulus Linux 3.6 onto the secondary switch using ONIE. At
    this time, all traffic is going to the switch in the primary role.

7.  After the install, copy the license file and all the {{<link url="Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux" text="configuration files">}} you backed up, then restart the `switchd`, networking, and Quagga services. All traffic is still going to the primary switch.  

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart switchd.service
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart networking.service
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart quagga.service

8.  Run `cl-img-select -fr` to boot the switch in the primary role into ONIE, then reboot the switch. Now, all traffic is going to the switch in the *secondary role* that you just upgraded to version 3.6.

9.  Install Cumulus Linux 3.6 onto the *primary switch* using ONIE.

10. After the install, copy the license file and all the {{<link url="Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux" text="configuration files">}} you backed up.

11. Follow the steps for {{<link url="Upgrading-from-Quagga-to-FRRouting" text="upgrading from Quagga to FRRouting">}}.

12. Enable `clagd` again in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file (set
    `clagd-enable` to *yes*), then run `ifreload -a`.  

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a

13. Bring up all the front panel ports:  

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ip link set swp<#> up

14. Now the two switches are dual-connected again and traffic flows to both switches.

{{%notice warning%}}

**Perl, Python and BDB Modules**

Any Perl scripts that use the `DB_File` module or Python scripts that use the `bsddb` module won't run under Cumulus Linux 3.6.

<p>Package: linux</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2018-1087 CVE-2018-8897</p>
<p>Debian Bug: 897427 897599 898067 898100</p>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1087</p>
<p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that the KVM implementation did not properly handle #DB exceptions while deferred by MOV SS/POP SS, allowing an unprivileged KVM guest user to crash the guest or potentially escalate their privileges.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-8897</p>
<p>Nick Peterson of Everdox Tech LLC discovered that #DB exceptions that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS are not properly handled, allowing an unprivileged user to crash the kernel and cause a denial of service.</p>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks.</p>
<p>CVE-2015-9016</p>
<p>Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue block layer (blk-mq). On a system with a driver using blk-mq (mtip32xx, null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user might be able to use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-0861</p>
<p>Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound) PCM core. We believe this was not possible in practice.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-5715</p>
<p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system.</p>
<p>This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64 and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-5753</p>
<p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system.</p>
<p>This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and replacing the array access with the speculation-safe array_index_nospec() function.</p>
<p>More use sites will be added over time.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-13166</p>
<p>A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling code has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing destination addresses to be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a local user with access to a suitable video device can exploit this to overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-13220</p>
<p>Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation could dereference a pointer before performing the necessary type check. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-16526</p>
<p>Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference an invalid pointer in an error case. A local user might be able to use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-16911</p>
<p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed kernel heap addresses to local users. This information could aid the exploitation of other vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-16912</p>
<p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading to an out-of-bounds read. A remote user able to connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-16913</p>
<p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading to excessive memory allocation. A remote user able to connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-16914</p>
<p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to check for an invalid combination of fields in a received packet, leading to a null pointer dereference. A remote user able to connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-18017</p>
<p>Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a use-after-free. If this module is loaded, it could be used by a remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code execution.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-18203</p>
<p>Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices. A local user could potentially use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-18216</p>
<p>Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations, potentially leading to a null pointer dereference. A local user could use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-18232</p>
<p>Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS (Serial-AttachedSCSI) subsystem, between probing and destroying a port. This could lead to a deadlock. A physically present attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2017-18241</p>
<p>Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used. A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option could use this to cause a denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1066</p>
<p>Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a malicious server for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1068</p>
<p>The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1092</p>
<p>Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would trigger a null dereference when mounted. A local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-5332</p>
<p>Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-5333</p>
<p>Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference. A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could possibly use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-5750</p>
<p>Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap address. This information could aid the exploitation of other vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-5803</p>
<p>Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check the length of chunks to be created. A local or remote user could use this to cause a denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-6927</p>
<p>Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on futexes did not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a denial of service or other security impact.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-7492</p>
<p>The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null pointer check. A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could use this for denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-7566</p>
<p>Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free. A local user with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-7740</p>
<p>Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation did not properly range-check the file offset. A local user with access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-7757</p>
<p>Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached SCSI) subsystem. A local user on a system with SAS devices could use this to cause a denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-7995</p>
<p>Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE (Machine Check Exception) driver. This is unlikely to have any security impact.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-8781</p>
<p>Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap operation did not properly range-check the file offset. A local user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-8822</p>
<p>Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server. An ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or remote code execution in the client.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1000004</p>
<p>Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer core, between multiple ioctl operations. This could lead to a deadlock or use-after-free. A local user with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1000199</p>
<p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings. Local users can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other architectures.</p>

<p>Package : xdg-utils</p>
<p>CVE ID : CVE-2017-18266</p>
<p>Debian Bug : 898317</p>
<p>Gabriel Corona discovered that xdg-utils, a set of tools for desktop environment integration, is vulnerable to argument injection attacks. If the environment variable BROWSER in the victim host has a "%s" and the victim opens a link crafted by an attacker with xdg-open, the malicious party could manipulate the parameters used by the browser when opened. This manipulation could set, for example, a proxy to which the network traffic could be intercepted for that particular execution.</p>

<p>Debian Bug : 899170</p>
<p>The Qualys Research Labs discovered multiple vulnerabilities in procps, a set of command line and full screen utilities for browsing procfs. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1122</p>
<p>top reads its configuration from the current working directory if no $HOME was configured. If top were started from a directory writable by the attacker (such as /tmp) this could result in local privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1123</p>
<p>Denial of service against the ps invocation of another user.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1124</p>
<p>An integer overflow in the file2strvec() function of libprocps couldresult in local privilege escalation.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1125</p>
<p>A stack-based buffer overflow in pgrep could result in denial of service for a user using pgrep for inspecting a specially crafted process.</p>
<p>CVE-2018-1126</p>
<p>Incorrect integer size parameters used in wrappers for standard allocators could cause integer truncation and lead to integer overflow issues.</p>
<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in version 2:3.3.9-9+deb8u1.</p>
<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 2:3.3.12-3+deb9u1.</p>

<td>candidate EVPN best path not re-installed after EVPN type-2 MAC route is withdrawn</td>
<td><p>If hosts nodes reflect or bridge a frame received from access switch pairs back to the switches, a remote VRR virtual MAC that is normally learned through an EVPN type-2 MAC+IP (centralized advertise-default-gw) route is learned locally on a host-facing port. This is then propagated through a new type-2 MAC route throughout the environment and remote access switch pairs install the erroneous route.</p>
<p>To work around this issue, resend the EVPN update from the infra pair by changing the VRR MAC or clear the session.</p>

The maximum response time cannot be greater than or equal to the query interval, and the maximum response time must be read before the interval.</p>
<p>To work around this issue temporarily, move the query interval parameter to follow the <code>query-max-response-time</code> parameter and set the <code>query-max-response-time</code> to a value less than the query interval. You must repeat this workaround each time FRR writes to the <code>frr.conf</code> file.</p>

<td>With EVPN symmetric routing on a Trident II+ or Maverick switch, forwarding with overlay ECMP routes does not work</td>
<td><p>Packets from a host to a destination that is reachable through a VXLAN overlay ECMP path might not get forwarded. The forwarding might work if the underlying ECMP members point to the CPU, because of software forwarding.</p>
<p>The issue is seen on a leaf switch connected to the host sending the traffic. The issue can also been seen on a leaf switch connecting towards the destination where that egress route is ECMP.</p>
<p>Depending upon your network topology, one way to work around this issue is to use an as-path prepend so that one of the type 5 routes sent has a longer as-path:</p>
<pre><code> address-family ipv4 unicast
   distance bgp 190 200 190
-  network 0.0.0.0/0 route-map apply_med
+  network 0.0.0.0/0 route-map apply_aspath_prepend

+route-map apply_aspath_prepend permit 10
+ match ip address prefix-list default_route
+ set as-path prepend last-as 1
+end

You can see that the AS &quot;1&quot; is added to the as-path:

RN-766 (CM-19006)</td>
<td>On the Broadcom Trident II+ and Maverick platform, in an external VXLAN routing environment, the switch does not rewrite MAC addresses and TTL, so packets are dropped by the next hop</td>
<td><p>On the Broadcom Trident II+ and Maverick based switch, in an external VXLAN routing environment, when a lookup is done on the external-facing switch (exit/border leaf) after VXLAN decapsulation, the switch does not rewrite the MAC addresses and TTL; for through traffic, packets are dropped by the next hop instead of correctly routing from a VXLAN overlay network into a non-VXLAN external network (for example, to the Internet).</p>
<p>This issue affects all traffic from VXLAN overlay hosts that need to be routed after VXLAN decapsulation on an exit/border leaf, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic destined to external networks (through traffic)</li>
<li>Traffic destined to the exit leaf SVI address</li>
</ul>
<p>To work around this issue, modify the external-facing interface for each VLAN sub-interface by creating a temporary VNI and associating it with the existing VLAN ID.</p>
<p>For example, if the expected interface configuration is:</p>
<pre><code>auto swp3.2001
iface swp3.2001
    vrf vrf1
    address 45.0.0.2/24
# where swp3 is the external facing port and swp3.2001 is the VLAN sub-interface

auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-vlan-aware yes
    bridge ports vx-4001
    bridge-vids 4001

auto vx-4001
iface vx-4001
    vxlan-id 4001
    &lt;... usual vxlan config ...&gt;
    bridge-access 4001
\# where vnid 4001 represents the L3 VNI

auto vlan4001
iface vlan4001
    vlan-id 4001
    vlan-raw-device bridge
    vrf vrf1</code></pre>
<p>Modify the configuration as follows:</p>
<pre><code>auto swp3
iface swp3
    bridge-access 2001
# associate the port (swp3) with bridge 2001

auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-vlan-aware yes
    bridge ports swp3 vx-4001 vx-16000000
    bridge-vids 4001 2001
\# where vx-4001 is the existing VNI and vx-16000000 is a new temporary VNI
\# this is now bridging the port (swp3), the VNI (vx-4001),
\# and the new temporary VNI (vx-16000000)
\# the bridge VLAN IDs are now 4001 and 2001

auto vlan2001
iface vlan2001
    vlan-id 2001
    vrf vrf1
    address 45.0.0.2/24
    vlan-raw-device bridge
\# create a VLAN 2001 with the associated VRF and IP address

<td><p>When an ARP request or response (or IPv6 NS/NA) packet with double VLAN tags (such as 802.1Q over 802.1Q), is sent to a VXLAN overlay, the outer VLAN tag is stripped during VXLAN encapsulation. If the receiving VTEP is a Broadcom Trident II + platform, the post VXLAN decapsulated packet is incorrectly directed to the control plane. As the packet traverses the linux kernel VXLAN interface into the VLAN-aware bridge device, the exposed inner VLAN tag is incorrectly used for VLAN filtering against the outer VLAN set, causing the packet to be discarded.</p>

<td>On Dell S4148<strong>T</strong>-ON switches with Maverick ASICs, configuring 1G or 100M speeds on 10G fixed copper ports requires a ports.conf workaround</td>
<td><p>1G and 100M speeds on SFP ports are not working on the Dell S4148<strong>T</strong>-ON.</p>
<p>To enable a speed lower than 10G on a port on the S4148T platform, you must dedicate an entire port group (four interfaces) to a lower speed setting. Within a port group, you can mix 1G and 100M speeds, if needed. You cannot mix 10G and lower speeds.</p>
<p>To work around this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <code>/etc/cumulus/ports.conf</code> file, add each of the four ports in the port group as 1G interfaces. You must set each of the ports in the port group to be 1G. Port groups are swp1-4, swp5-8, swp9-12, and so on, and starting with swp31-35 on the right half of the switch. For example, to enable ports swp5-swp8 to autonegotiate to 100M or 1G speeds, add the following to the ports.conf file:<br />
</p>
<pre><code>5=1G
6=1G
7=1G
8=1G</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Restart <code>switchd</code>:<br />
</p>
<pre><code>cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl reset-failed switchd; sudo systemctl restart switchd</code></pre>
<p>After this is done ports swp5-8 will be enabled to autonegotiate with the neighbor devices to 1G or 100M speeds.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As of 3.5.1, 1G interfaces are supported when using the <code>ports.conf</code> file workaround as described above. As of 3.6.0, editing the <code>ports.conf</code> file is no longer required.</p></td>

<td>On the Broadcom Trident II+ and Maverick platform, in an external VXLAN routing environment, the switch does not rewrite MAC addresses and TTL, so packets are dropped by the next hop</td>
<td><p>On the Broadcom Trident II+ and Maverick based switch, in an external VXLAN routing environment, when a lookup is done on the external-facing switch (exit/border leaf) after VXLAN decapsulation, the switch does not rewrite the MAC addresses and TTL; for through traffic, packets are dropped by the next hop instead of correctly routing from a VXLAN overlay network into a non-VXLAN external network (for example, to the Internet).</p>
<p>This issue affects all traffic from VXLAN overlay hosts that need to be routed after VXLAN decapsulation on an exit/border leaf, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic destined to external networks (through traffic)</li>
<li>Traffic destined to the exit leaf SVI address</li>
</ul>
<p>This issue should be fixed in the Trident 3 ASIC.</p>
<p>To work around this issue, modify the external-facing interface for each VLAN sub-interface by creating a temporary VNI and associating it with the existing VLAN ID.</p>
<p>For example, if the expected interface configuration is:</p>
<pre><code>auto swp3.2001
iface swp3.2001
    vrf vrf1
    address 45.0.0.2/24
# where swp3 is the external facing port and swp3.2001 is the VLAN sub-interface

auto vlan4001
iface vlan4001
    vlan-id 4001
    vlan-raw-device bridge
    vrf vrf1</code></pre>
<p>Modify the configuration as follows:</p>
<pre><code>auto swp3
iface swp3
    bridge-access 2001
# associate the port (swp3) with bridge 2001

auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-vlan-aware yes

\# this is now bridging the port (swp3), the VNI (vx-4001),
\# and the new temporary VNI (vx-16000000)

<p>A heap corruption vulnerability was discovered in net-snmp, a suite of<br />
Simple Network Management Protocol applications, triggered when parsing<br />
the PDU prior to the authentication process. A remote, unauthenticated<br />
attacker can take advantage of this flaw to crash the snmpd process<br />

CVE ID : CVE-2017-3144 CVE-2018-5732 CVE-2018-5733<br />
Debian Bug : 887413 891785 891786</p>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ISC DHCP client,<br />
relay and server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project<br />
identifies the following issues:</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3144" class="external-link" title="Follow link">CVE-2017-3144</a></p>
<p>It was discovered that the DHCP server does not properly clean up<br />
closed OMAPI connections, which can lead to exhaustion of the pool<br />
of socket descriptors available to the DHCP server, resulting in<br />
denial of service.</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5732" class="external-link" title="Follow link">CVE-2018-5732</a></p>
<p>Felix Wilhelm of the Google Security Team discovered that the DHCP<br />
client is prone to an out-of-bound memory access vulnerability when<br />
processing specially constructed DHCP options responses, resulting<br />
in potential execution of arbitrary code by a malicious DHCP server.</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5733" class="external-link" title="Follow link">CVE-2018-5733</a></p>
<p>Felix Wilhelm of the Google Security Team discovered that the DHCP<br />
server does not properly handle reference counting when processing<br />
client requests. A malicious client can take advantage of this flaw<br />
to cause a denial of service (dhcpd crash) by sending large amounts<br />
of traffic.</p>
<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed<br />
in version 4.3.1-6+deb8u3.</p>
<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in<br />
version 4.3.5-3+deb9u1.</p>
<p>We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.</p>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that<br />
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information<br />
leaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8824">CVE-2017-8824</a></p>
<p>Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not<br />
correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and<br />
reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free. A local<br />
user could use this for denial of service (crash or data<br />
corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. On systems that<br />
do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated<br />
by disabling it:<br />
echo &gt;&gt; /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16995">CVE-2017-16995</a></p>
<p>Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier did not<br />
correctly model the behaviour of 32-bit load instructions. A<br />
local user can use this for privilege escalation.</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17448">CVE-2017-17448</a></p>
<p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem allowed<br />
users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace, not<br />
just the root namespace, to enable and disable connection tracking<br />
helpers. This could lead to denial of service, violation of<br />
network security policy, or have other impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17449">CVE-2017-17449</a></p>
<p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem allowed<br />
users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace<br />
to monitor netlink traffic in all net namespaces, not just<br />
those owned by that user namespace. This could lead to<br />
exposure of sensitive information.</p>

<p>Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly<br />
handle some error conditions during initialisation. A physically<br />
present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to<br />
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or<br />
possibly for privilege escalation.</p>

<p>Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would<br />
over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the<br />
kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled. A guest virtual machine might be<br />
able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17805">CVE-2017-17805</a></p>
<p>It was discovered that some implementations of the Salsa20 block<br />
cipher did not correctly handle zero-length input. A local user<br />
could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly<br />
have other security impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17806">CVE-2017-17806</a></p>
<p>It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with<br />
an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not<br />
intended. A local user could use this to cause a denial of<br />
service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege<br />
escalation.</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17807">CVE-2017-17807</a></p>
<p>Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for<br />
write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.<br />
A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to<br />
obtain sensitive information.</p>
<p><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000407">CVE-2017-1000407</a></p>
<p>Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel<br />
processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which<br />
is not generally safe. On some systems this allows a guest<br />
VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000410">CVE-2017-1000410</a></p>
<p>Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not correctly<br />
handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP messages. An<br />
attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to<br />
obtain sensitive information from the kernel.</p>
<p>Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they<br />
are enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl) then<br />
CVE-2017-17448 can be exploited by any local user.</p></td>

<td><p>Cumulus Linux 3.6.0 or later does not forward transit precision time protocol (PTP) packets as PTP is not enabled by default in Cumulus Linux.</p>
<p>To work around this issue, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downgrade the switch to Cumulus Linux 3.5.3.</li>
<li>Enable PTP on the Cumulus Linux switch. Edit <code>/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf</code> and set <code>ptp.timestamping</code> to <em>TRUE</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This issue should be fixed in an upcoming release of Cumulus Linux.</p></td>
