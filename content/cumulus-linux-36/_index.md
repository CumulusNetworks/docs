## Introducing Cumulus Linux

Cumulus Linux is the first full-featured Linux operating system for the networking industry. The [Debian Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/)-based, networking-focused distribution runs on hardware produced by a [broad partner ecosystem](http://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/), ensuring unmatched customer choice regarding silicon, optics, cables, and systems.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the Cumulus Linux installation process, system configuration and management, network solutions, and monitoring and troubleshooting recommendations. In addition, the quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process to get you started.
