*Zero touch provisioning* (ZTP) enables you to deploy network devices quickly in large-scale environments. On first boot, Cumulus Linux invokes ZTP, which executes the provisioning automation used to deploy the device for its intended role in the network.

The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed. You can develop this script using a variety of automation tools and scripting languages, providing ample flexibility for you to design the provisioning scheme to meet your needs. You can also use it to add the switch to a configuration management (CM) platform such as {{<exlink url="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet" text="Puppet">}}, {{<exlink url="http://www.opscode.com" text="Chef">}}, {{<exlink url="https://cfengine.com" text="CFEngine">}} or possibly a custom, proprietary tool.

While developing and testing the provisioning logic, you can use the `ztp` command in Cumulus Linux to manually invoke your provisioning script on a device.

ZTP in Cumulus Linux can occur automatically in one of the following ways, in this order:

- Through a local file
- Using a USB drive inserted into the switch (ZTP-USB)
- Through DHCP

Each method is discussed in greater detail below.

## Zero Touch Provisioning Using a Local File

ZTP only looks once for a ZTP script on the local file system when the switch boots. ZTP searches for an install script that matches an {{<exlink url="http://onie.org" text="ONIE">}}-style waterfall in `/var/lib/cumulus/ztp`, looking for the most specific name first, and ending at the most generic:

- `'cumulus-ztp-' + architecture + '-' + vendor + '_' + model + '-r' + revision`
- `'cumulus-ztp-' + architecture + '-' + vendor + '_' + model`
- `'cumulus-ztp-' + vendor + '_' + model`
- `'cumulus-ztp-' + architecture`
- `'cumulus-ztp'`

For example:

```
cumulus-ztp-amd64-cel_pebble-rUNKNOWN
cumulus-ztp-amd64-cel_pebble
cumulus-ztp-cel_pebble
cumulus-ztp-amd64
cumulus-ztp
```

You can also trigger the ZTP process manually by running the `ztp --run <URL>` command, where the URL is the path to the ZTP script.

## Zero Touch Provisioning Using a USB Drive (ZTP-USB)

{{%notice note%}}

This feature has been tested only with *thumb* drives, not an actual external large USB hard drive.

{{%/notice%}}

If the `ztp` process does not discover a local script, it tries once to locate an inserted but unmounted USB drive. If it discovers one, it begins the ZTP process.

Cumulus Linux supports the use of a FAT32, FAT16, or VFAT-formatted USB drive as an installation source for ZTP scripts. You must plug in the USB drive **before** you power up the switch.

At minimum, the script must:

- Install the Cumulus Linux operating system and license.
- Copy over a basic configuration to the switch.
- Restart the switch or the relevant serves to get `switchd` up and
  running with that configuration.

Follow these steps to perform zero touch provisioning using a USB drive:

1. Copy the Cumulus Linux license and installation image to the USB drive.
2. The `ztp` process searches the root filesystem of the newly mounted drive for filenames matching an {{<exlink url="https://opencomputeproject.github.io/onie/design-spec/discovery.html#installer-discovery-methods" text="ONIE-style waterfall">}} (see the patterns and examples above), looking for the most specific name first, and ending at the most generic.
3. The contents of the script are parsed to ensure it contains the `CUMULUS-AUTOPROVISIONING` flag.

{{%notice note%}}

The USB drive is mounted to a temporary directory under `/tmp` (for example, `/tmp/tmpigGgjf/`). To reference files on the USB drive, use the environment variable `ZTP_USB_MOUNTPOINT` to refer to the USB root partition.

{{%/notice%}}

## Zero Touch Provisioning over DHCP

If the `ztp` process does not discover a local/ONIE script or applicable USB drive, it checks DHCP every ten seconds for up to five minutes for the presence of a ZTP URL specified in `/var/run/ztp.dhcp`. The URL can be any of HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or TFTP.

For ZTP using DHCP, provisioning initially takes place over the management network and is initiated through a DHCP hook. A DHCP option is used to specify a configuration script. This script is then requested from the Web server and executed locally on the switch.

The zero touch provisioning process over DHCP follows these steps:

1. The first time you boot Cumulus Linux, eth0 is configured for DHCP and makes a DHCP request.
2. The DHCP server offers a lease to the switch.
3. If option 239 is present in the response, the zero touch provisioning process starts.
4. The zero touch provisioning process requests the contents of the script from the URL, sending additional {{<link url="#inspect-http-headers" text="HTTP headers">}} containing details about the switch.
5. The contents of the script are parsed to ensure it contains the `CUMULUS-AUTOPROVISIONING` flag (see {{<link url="#write-ztp-scripts" text="example scripts">}}).
6. If provisioning is necessary, the script executes locally on the switch with root privileges.
7. The return code of the script is examined. If it is 0, the provisioning state is marked as complete in the autoprovisioning configuration file.

### Trigger ZTP over DHCP

If provisioning has not already occurred, it is possible to trigger the zero touch provisioning process over DHCP when eth0 is set to use DHCP and one of the following events occur:

- The switch boots.
- You plug a cable into or unplug a cable from the eth0 port.
- You disconnect, then reconnect the switch power cord.

You can also run the `ztp --run <URL>` command, where the `URL` is the path to the ZTP script.

### Configure the DHCP Server

During the DHCP process over eth0, Cumulus Linux requests DHCP option 239. This option is used to specify the custom provisioning script.

For example, the `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file for an ISC DHCP server looks like:

```
option cumulus-provision-url code 239 = text;

subnet 192.0.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 range 192.0.2.100 192.168.0.200;
 option cumulus-provision-url "http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh";
}
```

Additionally, you can specify the hostname of the switch with the `host-name` option:

```
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 range 192.168.0.100 192.168.0.200;
 option cumulus-provision-url "http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh";
 host dc1-tor-sw1 { hardware ethernet 44:38:39:00:1a:6b; fixed-address 192.168.0.101; option host-name "dc1-tor-sw1"; }
}
```

### Inspect HTTP Headers

The following HTTP headers are sent in the request to the webserver to retrieve the provisioning script:

```
Header                        Value                 Example
------                        -----                 -------

```

## Write ZTP Scripts

{{%notice note%}}

Remember to include the following line in any of the supported scripts that you expect to run using the autoprovisioning framework.

```
# CUMULUS-AUTOPROVISIONING
```

This line is required somewhere in the script file for execution to occur.

{{%/notice%}}

The script must contain the `CUMULUS-AUTOPROVISIONING` flag. You can include this flag in a comment or remark; the flag does not need to be echoed or written to `stdout`.

You can write the script in any language currently supported by Cumulus Linux, such as:

- Perl
- Python
- Ruby
- Shell

The script must return an exit code of 0 upon success, as this triggers the autoprovisioning process to be marked as complete in the autoprovisioning configuration file.

The following script installs Cumulus Linux and its license from a USB drive and applies a configuration:

```
#!/bin/bash
function error() {
    echo -e "\e[0;33mERROR: The Zero Touch Provisioning script failed while running the command $BASH_COMMAND at line $BASH_LINENO.\e[0m" >&2
    exit 1
}
# Log all output from this script
exec >> /var/log/autoprovision 2>&1
date "+%FT%T ztp starting script $0"

trap error ERR

#Add Debian Repositories
echo "deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian jessie main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

#Update Package Cache
apt-get update -y

#Load interface config from usb
cp ${ZTP_USB_MOUNTPOINT}/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces

#Load port config from usb
#   (if breakout cables are used for certain interfaces)
cp ${ZTP_USB_MOUNTPOINT}/ports.conf /etc/cumulus/ports.conf

#Install a License from usb and restart switchd
/usr/cumulus/bin/cl-license -i ${ZTP_USB_MOUNTPOINT}/license.txt && systemctl restart switchd.service

#Reload interfaces to apply loaded config
ifreload -a

#Output state of interfaces
net show interface

# CUMULUS-AUTOPROVISIONING
exit 0
```

Several ZTP example scripts are available in the {{<exlink url="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/example-ztp-scripts" text="Cumulus GitHub repository">}}.

## Best Practices for ZTP Scripts

ZTP scripts come in different forms and frequently perform many of the same tasks. As BASH is the most common language used for ZTP scripts, the following BASH snippets are provided to accelerate your ability to perform common tasks with robust error checking.

### Install a License

Use the following function to include error checking for license file installation.

```
function install_license(){
    # Install license
    echo "$(date) INFO: Installing License..."
    echo $1 | /usr/cumulus/bin/cl-license -i
    return_code=$?
    if [ "$return_code" == "0" ]; then
        echo "$(date) INFO: License Installed."
    else
        echo "$(date) ERROR: License not installed. Return code was: $return_code"
         /usr/cumulus/bin/cl-license
         exit 1
    fi
}
```

### Test DNS Name Resolution

DNS names are frequently used in ZTP scripts. The `ping_until_reachable` function tests that each DNS name resolves into a reachable IP address. Call this function with each DNS target used in your script before you use the DNS name elsewhere in your script.

The following example shows how to call the `ping_until_reachable` function in the context of a larger task.

```
function ping_until_reachable(){
    last_code=1
    max_tries=30
    tries=0
    while [ "0" != "$last_code" ] && [ "$tries" -lt "$max_tries" ]; do
        tries=$((tries+1))
        echo "$(date) INFO: ( Attempt $tries of $max_tries ) Pinging $1 Target Until Reachable."
        ping $1 -c2 &> /dev/null
        last_code=$?
            sleep 1
    done
    if [ "$tries" -eq "$max_tries" ] && [ "$last_code" -ne "0" ]; then
        echo "$(date) ERROR: Reached maximum number of attempts to ping the target $1 ."
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

### Check the Cumulus Linux Release

The following script segment demonstrates how to check which Cumulus Linux release is running currently and upgrades the node if the release is not the *target release*. If the release *is* the target release, normal ZTP tasks execute. This script calls the `ping_until_reachable` script (described above) to make sure the server holding the image server and the ZTP script is reachable.

```
function init_ztp(){
    #do normal ZTP tasks
}

CUMULUS_TARGET_RELEASE=3.5.3
CUMULUS_CURRENT_RELEASE=$(cat /etc/lsb-release  | grep RELEASE | cut -d "=" -f2)
IMAGE_SERVER_HOSTNAME=webserver.example.com
IMAGE_SERVER= "http:// "$IMAGE_SERVER_HOSTNAME "/ "$CUMULUS_TARGET_RELEASE ".bin "
ZTP_URL= "http:// "$IMAGE_SERVER_HOSTNAME "/ztp.sh "

if [ "$CUMULUS_TARGET_RELEASE" != "$CUMULUS_CURRENT_RELEASE" ]; then
ping_until_reachable $IMAGE_SERVER_HOSTNAME
/usr/cumulus/bin/onie-install -fa -i $IMAGE_SERVER -z $ZTP_URL && reboot
else
    init_ztp && reboot
fi
exit 0
```

### Apply Management VRF Configuration

If you apply a management VRF in your script, either apply it last or reboot instead. If you do *not* apply a management VRF last, you need to prepend any commands that require `eth0` to communicate out with `/usr/bin/ip vrf exec mgmt`; for example, `/usr/bin/ip vrf exec mgmt apt-get update -y`.

### Perform Ansible Provisioning Callbacks

After initially configuring a node with ZTP, use {{<exlink url="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#provisioning-callbacks" text="Provisioning Callbacks">}} to inform Ansible Tower or AWX that the node is ready for more detailed provisioning. The following example demonstrates how to use a provisioning callback:

```
/usr/bin/curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -k -X POST --data '{"host_config_key":"'somekey'"}' -u username:password http://ansible.example.com/api/v2/job_templates/1111/callback/
```

### Disable the DHCP Hostname Override Setting

Make sure to disable the DHCP hostname override setting in your script (NCLU does this for in Cumulus Linux 3.5 and above).

```
function set_hostname(){
    # Remove DHCP Setting of Hostname
    sed s/'SETHOSTNAME="yes"'/'SETHOSTNAME="no"'/g -i /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/dhcp-sethostname
    hostnamectl set-hostname $1
}
```

### NCLU in ZTP Scripts

{{%notice info%}}

Not all aspects of NCLU are supported when running during ZTP. Use traditional Linux methods of providing configuration to the switch during ZTP.

Most notably, using the `net del all` command in a ZTP script sets `zebra=yes` in `/etc/frr/daemons`. This causes ZTP to fail.

{{%/notice%}}

When you use NCLU in ZTP scripts, add the following loop to make sure NCLU has time to start up before being called.

```
# Waiting for NCLU to finish starting up
last_code=1
while [ "1" == "$last_code" ]; do
    net show interface &> /dev/null
    last_code=$?
done

net add vrf mgmt
net add time zone Etc/UTC
net add time ntp server 192.168.0.254 iburst
net commit
```

## Test ZTP Scripts

There are a few commands you can use to test and debug your ZTP scripts.

You can use verbose mode to debug your script and see where your script failed. Include the `-v` option when you run `ztp`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -v -r http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh
Attempting to provision via ZTP Manual from http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh

Broadcast message from root@dell-s6000-01 (ttyS0) (Tue May 10 22:44:17 2016):  

ZTP: Attempting to provision via ZTP Manual from http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh
ZTP Manual: URL response code 200
ZTP Manual: Found Marker CUMULUS-AUTOPROVISIONING
ZTP Manual: Executing http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh
error: ZTP Manual: Payload returned code 1
error: Script returned failure
```

To see if ZTP is enabled and to see results of the most recent execution, you can run the `ztp -s` command.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ ztp -s
ZTP INFO:

State              enabled
Version            1.0
Result             Script Failure

Method             ZTP DHCP
URL                http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh
```

If ZTP runs when the switch boots and not manually, you can run the `systemctl -l status ztp.service` then `journalctl -l -u ztp.service` to see if any failures occur:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl -l status ztp.service

If you see that the issue is a script failure, you can modify the script and then run `ztp` manually using `ztp -v -r <URL/path to that script>`, as above.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -v -r http://192.0.2.1/demo.sh

```

Errors in syslog for ZTP like those shown above often occur if the script is created (or edited as some point) on a Windows machine. Check to make sure that the `\r\n` characters are *not* present in the end-of-line encodings.

Use the `cat -v ztp.sh` command to view the contents of the script and search for any hidden characters.

```
root@oob-mgmt-server:/var/www/html# cat -v ./ztp_oob_windows.sh
#!/bin/bash^M
^M
###################^M
#   ZTP Script^M

^M
exit 0^M
^M
# The line below is required to be a valid ZTP script^M
#CUMULUS-AUTOPROVISIONING^M
root@oob-mgmt-server:/var/www/html#
```

The `^M` characters in the output of your ZTP script, as shown above, indicate the presence of Windows end-of-line encodings that you need to remove.

Use the translate (`tr`) command on any Linux system to remove the `'\r'` characters from the file.

```
root@oob-mgmt-server:/var/www/html# tr -d '\r' < ztp_oob_windows.sh > ztp_oob_unix.sh
root@oob-mgmt-server:/var/www/html# cat -v ./ztp_oob_unix.sh

## Manually Use the ztp Command

To enable zero touch provisioning, use the `-e` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -e
```

{{%notice note%}}

Enabling `ztp` means that `ztp` tries to run the next time the switch boots. However, if ZTP already ran on a previous boot up or if a manual configuration has been found, ZTP will just exit without trying to look for any script.

ZTP checks for these manual configurations during bootup:

- Password changes
- Users and groups changes
- Packages changes
- Interfaces changes
- The presence of an installed license

When the switch is booted for the very first time, ZTP records the state of important files that are most likely going to be modified after that the switch is configured. If ZTP is still enabled after a reboot, ZTP compares the recorded state to the current state of these files. If they do not match, ZTP considers that the switch has already been provisioned and exits. These files are only erased after a reset.

{{%/notice%}}

To reset `ztp` to its original state, use the `-R` option and the -i option. This removes the `ztp` directory and `ztp` runs the next time the switch reboots.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -R
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -i
```

To disable zero touch provisioning, use the `-d` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -d
```

To force provisioning to occur and ignore the status listed in the configuration file, use the `-r` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -r cumulus-ztp.sh
```

To see the current `ztp` state, use the `-s` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ztp -s
ZTP INFO:
State disabled
Version 1.0
Result success
Date Thu May 5 16:49:33 2016 UTC
Method Switch manually configured  
URL None
```

In Cumulus Linux 3.7.11 and later, you can run the NCLU `net show system ztp script` or `net show system ztp json` command to see the current `ztp` state.

## Notes

- During the development of a provisioning script, the switch might need to be rebooted.
- You can use the Cumulus Linux `onie-select -i` command to cause the switch to reprovision itself and install a network operating system again using ONIE.
