Spanning tree protocol (STP) identifies links in the network and shuts down redundant links, preventing possible network loops and broadcast radiation on a bridged network. STP also provides redundant links for automatic failover when an active link fails. STP is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux for both VLAN-aware and traditional bridges.

Cumulus Linux supports RSTP, PVST, and PVRST modes:

- *{{<link url="Traditional-Bridge-Mode" text="Traditional bridges">}}* operate in both PVST and PVRST mode. The default is set to PVRST. Each traditional bridge has its own separate STP instance.
- *{{<link url="VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode" text="VLAN-aware bridges">}}* operate **only** in RSTP mode.

## STP for a Traditional Mode Bridge

Per VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) creates a spanning tree instance for a bridge. Rapid PVST (PVRST) supports RSTP enhancements for each spanning tree instance. To use PVRST with a traditional bridge, you must create a bridge corresponding to the untagged native VLAN and all the physical switch ports must be part of the same VLAN.

{{%notice note%}}

For maximum interoperability, when connected to a switch that has a native VLAN configuration, the native VLAN **must** be configured to be VLAN 1 only.

{{%/notice%}}

## STP for a VLAN-aware Bridge

VLAN-aware bridges operate in RSTP mode only. RSTP on VLAN-aware bridges works with other modes in the following ways:

### RSTP and STP

If a bridge running RSTP (802.1w) receives a common STP (802.1D) BPDU, it falls back to 802.1D automatically.

### RSTP and PVST

The RSTP domain sends BPDUs on the native VLAN, whereas PVST sends BPDUs on a per VLAN basis. For both protocols to work together, you need to enable the native VLAN on the link between the RSTP to PVST domain; the spanning tree is built according to the native VLAN parameters.

The RSTP protocol does not send or parse BPDUs on other VLANs, but floods BPDUs across the network, enabling the PVST domain to maintain its spanning-tree topology and provide a loop-free network. 
- To enable proper BPDU exchange across the network, be sure to allow all VLANs participating in the PVST domain on the link between the RSTP and PVST domains.
- When using RSTP together with an existing PVST network, you need to define the root bridge on the PVST domain. Either lower the priority on the PVST domain or change the priority of the RSTP switches to a higher number.
- When connecting a VLAN-aware bridge to a proprietary PVST+ switch using STP, you must allow VLAN 1 on all 802.1Q trunks that interconnect them, regardless of the configured *native* VLAN. Only VLAN 1 enables the switches to address the BPDU frames to the IEEE multicast MAC address. The proprietary switch might be configured like this:

   ```
   switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-100
   ```

### RSTP and MST

RSTP works with MST seamlessly, creating a single instance of spanning tree that transmits BPDUs on the native VLAN.

RSTP treats the MST domain as one giant switch, whereas MST treats the RSTP domain as a different region. To enable proper communication between the regions, MST creates a Common Spanning Tree (CST) that connects all the boundary switches and forms the overall view of the MST domain. Because changes in the CST need to be reflected in all regions, the RSTP tree is included in the CST to ensure that changes on the RSTP domain are reflected in the CST domain. This does cause topology changes on the RSTP domain to impact the rest of the network but keeps the MST domain informed of every change occurring in the RSTP domain, ensuring a loop-free network.

Configure the root bridge within the MST domain by changing the priority on the relevant MST switch. When MST detects an RSTP link, it falls back into RSTP mode. The MST domain choses the switch with the lowest cost to the CST root bridge as the CIST root bridge.

### RSTP with MLAG

More than one spanning tree instance enables switches to load balance and use different links for different VLANs. With RSTP, there is only one instance of spanning tree. To better utilize the links, you can configure MLAG on the switches connected to the MST or PVST domain and set up these interfaces as an MLAG port. The PVST or MST domain thinks it is connected to a single switch and utilizes all the links connected to it. Load balancing is based on the port channel hashing mechanism instead of different spanning tree instances and uses all the links between the RSTP to the PVST or MST domains. For information about configuring MLAG, see {{<link url="Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG" text="Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation - MLAG">}}.

## Optional Configuration

There are a number of ways to customize STP in Cumulus Linux. Exercise caution when changing the settings below to prevent malfunctions in STP loop avoidance.

### Spanning Tree Priority

If you have a multiple spanning tree instance (MSTI 0, also known as a common spanning tree, or CST), you can set the *tree priority* for a bridge. The bridge with the lowest priority is elected the *root bridge*. The priority must be a number between *0* and *61440,* and must be a multiple of 4096. The default is *32768*.

To set the tree priority, run the following commands:

{{< tabs "TabID213 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

The following example command sets the tree priority to 8192:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge stp treeprio 8192
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Configure the tree priority (`mstpctl-treeprio`) under the *bridge* stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file, then run the `ifreload -a` command. The following example command sets the tree priority to 8192:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto bridge
iface bridge
    # bridge-ports includes all ports related to VxLAN and CLAG.
    # does not include the Peerlink.4094 subinterface
    bridge-ports bond01 bond02 peerlink vni13 vni24 vxlan4001
    bridge-pvid 1
    bridge-vids 13 24
    bridge-vlan-aware yes
    mstpctl-treeprio 8192
...
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ ifreload -a
```

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux supports MSTI 0 only. It does not support MSTI 1 through 15.

### PortAdminEdge (PortFast Mode)

*PortAdminEdge* is equivalent to the PortFast feature offered by other vendors. It enables or disables the *initial edge state* of a port in a bridge.

All ports configured with PortAdminEdge bypass the listening and learning states to move immediately to forwarding.

{{%notice warning%}}

PortAdminEdge mode might cause loops if it is not used with the {{<link url="#bpdu-guard" text="BPDU guard">}} feature.

{{%/notice%}}

It is common for edge ports to be configured as access ports for a simple end host; however, this is not mandatory. In the data center, edge ports typically connect to servers, which might pass both tagged and untagged traffic.

To configure PortAdminEdge mode:

{{< tabs "TabID276 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

The following example commands configure PortAdminEdge and BPDU guard for swp5.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp5 stp bpduguard
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp5 stp portadminedge
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Configure PortAdminEdge and BPDU guard under the switch port interface stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file, then run the `ifreload -a` command. The following example configures PortAdminEdge and BPD guard on swp5.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/netowrk/interfaces
...
auto swp5
iface swp5
    mstpctl-bpduguard yes
    mstpctl-portadminedge yes
...
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```

**Runtime Configuration (Advanced)**

{{%notice warning%}}

A runtime configuration is non-persistent, which means the configuration you create here does not persist after you reboot the switch.

{{%/notice%}}

To configure PortAdminEdge and BPDU guard at runtime, run the following commands:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl setportadminedge br2 swp1 yes
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl setbpduguard br2 swp1 yes
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### PortAutoEdge

*PortAutoEdge* is an enhancement to the standard PortAdminEdge (PortFast) mode, which allows for the automatic detection of edge ports. PortAutoEdge enables and disables the *auto transition* to and from the edge state of a port in a bridge.

{{%notice note%}}

Edge ports and access ports are not the same. Edge ports transition directly to the forwarding state and skip the listening and learning stages. Upstream topology change notifications are not generated when an edge port link changes state. Access ports only forward untagged traffic; however, there is no such restriction on edge ports, which can forward both tagged and untagged traffic.

{{%/notice%}}

When a BPDU is received on a port configured with PortAutoEdge, the port ceases to be in the edge port state and transitions into a normal STP port. When BPDUs are no longer received on the interface, the port becomes an edge port, and transitions through the discarding and learning states before resuming forwarding.

PortAutoEdge is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux.

To disable PortAutoEdge for an interface:

{{< tabs "TabID344 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

The following example commands disable PortAutoEdge on swp1:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp1 stp portautoedge no
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the switch port interface stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to add the `mstpctl-portautoedge no` line, then run the `ifreload -a` command. The following example disables PortAutoEdge on swp1:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto swp1
iface swp1
    alias to Server01
    # Port to Server02
    mstpctl-portautoedge no
...
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

To re-enable PortAutoEdge for an interface:

{{< tabs "TabID383 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

The following example commands re-enable PortAutoEdge on swp1:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net del interface swp1 stp portautoedge no
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the switch port interface stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to remove `mstpctl-portautoedge no`, then run the `ifreload -a` command.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### BPDU Guard

You can configure *BPDU guard* to protect the spanning tree topology from unauthorized switches affecting the forwarding path. For example, if you add a new switch to an access port off a leaf switch and this new switch is configured with a low priority, it might become the new root switch and affect the forwarding path for the entire layer 2 topology.

To configure BPDU guard:

{{< tabs "TabID411 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

The following example commands set BPDU guard for swp5:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp5 stp bpduguard
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the switch port interface stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to add the `mstpctl-bpduguard yes` line, then run the `ifreload -a` command. The following example sets BPDU guard for interface swp5:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto swp5
iface swp5
    mstpctl-bpduguard yes
...
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

If a BPDU is received on the port, STP brings down the port and logs an error in `/var/log/syslog`. The following is a sample error:

```
mstpd: error, MSTP_IN_rx_bpdu: bridge:bond0 Recvd BPDU on BPDU Guard Port - Port Down
```

To determine whether BPDU guard is configured, or if a BPDU has been received:

{{< tabs "TabID454 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show bridge spanning-tree | grep bpdu
  bpdu guard port    yes                bpdu guard error     yes
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

The only way to recover a port that has been placed in the disabled state is to manually bring up the port with the `sudo ifup <interface>` command. See {{<link title="Interface Configuration and Management">}} for more information about `ifupdown`.

{{%notice note%}}

Bringing up the disabled port does not correct the problem if the configuration on the connected end-station has not been resolved.

{{%/notice%}}

### Bridge Assurance

On a point-to-point link where RSTP is running, if you want to detect unidirectional links and put the port in a discarding state, you can enable bridge assurance on the port by enabling a port type network. The port is then in a bridge assurance inconsistent state until a BPDU is received from the peer. You need to configure the port type network on both ends of the link for bridge assurance to operate properly.

Bridge assurance is disabled by default.

To enable bridge assurance on an interface:

{{< tabs "TabID513 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

The following example commands enable bridge assurance on swp1:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp1 stp portnetwork
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the switch port interface stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to add the `mstpctl-portnetwork yes` line, then run the `ifreload -a` command. The following example enables bridge assurance on swp5:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto swp5
iface swp5
    mstpctl-portnetwork yes
...
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```

**Runtime Configuration (Advanced)**

{{%notice warning%}}

A runtime configuration is non-persistent, which means the configuration you create here does not persist after you reboot the switch.

{{%/notice%}}

To enable bridge assurance at runtime, run `mstpctl`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl setportnetwork br1007 swp1.1007 yes

cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl showportdetail br1007 swp1.1007 | grep network
  network port       yes                     BA inconsistent      yes
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

To monitor logs for bridge assurance messages, run the following command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo grep -in assurance /var/log/syslog | grep mstp
  1365:Jun 25 18:03:17 mstpd: br1007:swp1.1007 Bridge assurance inconsistent
```

### BPDU Filter

You can enable `bpdufilter` on a switch port, which filters BPDUs in both directions. This disables STP on the port as no BPDUs are transiting.

{{%notice warning%}}

Using BDPU filter might cause layer 2 loops. Use this feature deliberately and with extreme caution.

{{%/notice%}}

To configure the BPDU filter on an interface:

{{< tabs "TabID584 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

The following example commands configure the BPDU filter on swp6:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp6 stp portbpdufilter
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the switch port interface stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to add the `mstpctl-portbpdufilter yes` line, then run the `ifreload -a` command. The following example configures BPDU filter on swp6:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto swp6
iface swp6
    mstpctl-portbpdufilter yes
...
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```

**Runtime Configuration (Advanced)**

{{%notice warning%}}

A runtime configuration is non-persistent, which means the configuration you create here does not persist after you reboot the switch.

{{%/notice%}}

To enable BPDU filter at runtime, run `mstpctl`. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl setportbpdufilter br100 swp1.100=yes swp2.100=yes
```

The `mstpctl` utility provided by the `mstpd` service configures STP. The `mstpd` daemon is an open source project used by Cumulus Linux to implement IEEE802.1D 2004 and IEEE802.1Q 2011.

The `mstpd` daemon starts by default when the switch boots and logs errors to `/var/log/syslog`.

{{%notice warning%}}

`mstpd` is the preferred utility for interacting with STP on Cumulus Linux. `brctl` also provides certain tools for configuring STP; however, they are not as complete and output from `brctl` might be misleading.

{{%/notice%}}

To show the bridge state, run the `brctl show` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo brctl show
