This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU groff
document formatting system. 
GNU groff was written by James Clark <jjc@jclark.com>.  
It is now maintained by Ted Harding <ted.harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk> and
Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.

This Debian package was previously maintained by Fabrizio Polacco
<fpolacco@debian.org>.
It is now maintained by Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>.

The original tarball came from <URL:ftp://groff.ffii.org/pub/groff/>:
  48fa768dd6fdeb7968041dd5ae8e2b02  groff-1.20.1.tar.gz
and was simply renamed to groff_1.20.1.orig.tar.gz.

Some patches have been applied to groff outside the debian directory.

The Debian diff also appends /usr/share/groff/tmac to the default macro path
for compatibility with versions of groff earlier than 1.17 (patch by Colin
Watson).

dvi format, HP LaserJet 4 printers, Canon CAPSL printers, HTML format
(still alpha), and typewriter-like devices.  Also included is a modified
version of the Berkeley -me macros, an enhanced version of the X11
xditview previewer, and an implementation of the -mm macros contributed
by Joergen Haegg (jh@axis.se).

The groff manual is also distributed under the terms of the GNU Free
Documentation License version 1.3.  On Debian systems, this is available in
/usr/share/common-licenses/GFDL-1.3 as part of the base-files package.
However, Debian does not consider this free when the Front-Cover Texts or
Back-Cover Texts options are used.  groff is distributed with a LICENSES
file containing the following text (excerpted):

  The groff program is a free software project.  It is licensed under the GNU
  General Public License (GNU GPL), version 3 or later.
  
  The file COPYING in the top directory of the groff source package contains a
  copy of the GPL that was downloaded from the GNU web site
  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt at 3 jan 2009.
  
  All files part of groff are licensed under this version of the GPL (or
  licenses which are compatible with the GPL). You are free to choose
  version 3 or any subsequent version of the GPL.

I e-mailed the upstream maintainer to clarify the intent of this. Here is
the relevant part of the reply:

  This is the intention, of course.

  Sigh.  I haven't found time to revert the FDL stuff back to GPL.  It
  basically affects only Bernd Warken and me, and we have both agreed to
  return to GPL in case FDL makes problems.

(Note that this e-mail predates the current wording in LICENSES.)

It is therefore my understanding that the copyright holders of the groff
documentation intend it to be distributable under the terms of the GPL
version 3 or later.  The reference above to the FDL text in
/usr/share/common-licenses/ is for information only.

The file tmac/hyphen.us is identical to the file hyphen.tex, part of the TeX
system written by Donald E. Knuth; the master file can be found at:

  ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/tex/dist/lib/hyphen.tex

It has been renamed for consistency, i.e., to make patterns available under
the filenames hyphen.<language>, e.g. hyphen.de or hyphen.uk.

  Unlimited copying and redistribution of this file are permitted as long
  as this file is not modified. Modifications are permitted, but only if
  the resulting file is not named hyphen.tex.

=========================================================================

The file tmac/hyphen.fr contains the same patterns as the file frhyph.tex
(for TeX), which can be found at:

  http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/language/hyphenation/frhyph.tex

The patterns have been converted to a format groff can understand.
