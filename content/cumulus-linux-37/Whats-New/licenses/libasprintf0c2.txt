This is the Debian prepackaged version of the GNU gettext utilities.
GNU gettext was written by Ulrich Drepper <drepper@gnu.org>.
emacs po-mode was written by Fran√ßois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

This package was first created by Erick Branderhorst <branderh@debian.org>,
and is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>.

This release has been built using the sources from:

http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.19.3.tar.xz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.
