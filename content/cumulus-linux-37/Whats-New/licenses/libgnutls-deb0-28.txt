License: The main library is licensed under GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1+, Gnutls Extra (which is currently
just the openssl wrapper library), build system, testsuite and commandline
utilities are licenced under the GNU General Public License version 3+.  The
Guile bindings use the same license as the respective underlying library,
i.e. LGPLv2.1+ for the main library and GPLv3+ for Gnutls extra.

However to be able to use and link against libgnutls a program needs to be
available under a license compatible with LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ since GnuTLS
requires nettle which requires GMP. GMP (>= 6.0.0) is dual licensed 
LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+.

Excerpt from upstream's README:

LICENSING
---------
Since GnuTLS version 3.1.10, the core library has been released under
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.

Note, however, that new versions of the gmplib library used by GnuTLS
are distributed under LGPLv3, and as such binaries of this library
need to be distributed under LGPLv3. If this is undesirable older
versions of the gmplib which are under LGPLv2.1 (e.g., version 4.2.1)
may be used instead.

The GNU LGPL applies to the main GnuTLS library, while the
included applications as well as gnutls-openssl 
library are under the GNU GPL version 3.  The gnutls library is 
located in the lib/ directory, while the applications in src/ and
gnutls-openssl library is at extra/.

For any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package
note that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.
