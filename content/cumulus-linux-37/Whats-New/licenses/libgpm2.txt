This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the General Purpose
Mouse Interface utility. The general purpose mouse daemon tries to be
a useful mouse server for applications running on the Linux console.

This package was put together by, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>.

Now maintained as a team by:

   Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>
   Peter Samuelson <peter@p12n.org>

The upstream source was downloaded from:

   <http://unix.schottelius.org/gpm/archives/>

The initial changes while packaging were minor :-

   - adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
     various debian/* files.
   - gpm.c (processConn): type of socket length changed (size_t -> socklen_t).
   - debuglog.c: #include <string.h> to quiet -Wall.
   - doc/Makefile.in (maintainer-clean): clean without interaction and
     clean all relevant files (i.e. gpm.info-{1,2}).
   - doc/Makefile.in: add support for mouse-test.1.

The following changes were thought of and done mostly by François
Gouget <fgouget@mygale.org>; though I didn't apply his patches as
they were for various reasons:

   - gpn.c (cmdline): modified handling of -t command line argument, so it
     can be used by anyone regardless of whether or not a copy of gpm is
     already running.
   - gpn.c (usage): update for new -t option "types".
   - mice.c: improved descriptions of mouse types.
   - mice.c (M_listMice): function used by -t help, reworked version of
     old M_listTypes.
   - mice.c (M_listTypes): function used by -t types; lists only
     mnemonics.
