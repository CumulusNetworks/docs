This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GNU Make.  GNU
Make was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.

This package was put together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/

Changes:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * removed documentation that fails to meet the Debian free software
   guidelines.

The package has since changed maintainers, the current maintainer being 
Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@pilgrim.umass.edu>.
