Comment:
 The directories ext/, dist/, and cpan/ contain separate distributions
 that have been bundled with the Perl core. The copyright and license
 status of these have been detailed separately below.
 .
 It is assumed that all the other files are part of Perl and share the
 above copyright and license information unless explicitly specified
 differently. Only the exceptions have been detailed below.
 .
 As a small portion of the files are indeed licensed differently from
 the above, all the other licenses have been collected and/or duplicated
 at the end of this file to facilitate review.

Comment:
 The first two alternative licenses, as retrieved at
  Thu, 09 May 2013 00:00:38 +0300
 are included at the end of this file.
 .
 Part of this file carries the following comment:
 .
  FYI: This is the "Super-Fast" algorithm mentioned by Bob Jenkins in
  (http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html)
  It is by Paul Hsieh (c) 2004 and is analysed here
  http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/hash.html
  license terms are here:
  http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/weblicense.html
 .
 As of Thu, 09 May 2013 00:02:53 +0300, the "weblicense.html" document
 states:
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, the text
  and explicitly rendered exposition of all content under this website
  is covered by the Paul Hsieh exposition license.
 .
  For the specific coverage of raw source code (only) obtained from
  this website, you have the option of using the old-style BSD license
  to use the code instead of other the licenses. This option has been
  provided for people who can't figure out what I talking about with my
  derivative license, or who are using a old-style BSD compatible license.
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, derivative
  work by taking portions or ideas from the above mentioned exposition
  are covered by the Paul Hsieh derivative license.
 .
  Examples: Unless covered by another accompanying license, source code
  shown on my website can be used freely under the derivative license,
  (and may be distributed under a public domain license, whether compiled
  into another program or not, for example) however the font, comments,
  colors or any layout details associated to that source code in its
  exposition are covered by the exposition license.
 .
  The entire English text describing the code is also covered under the
  exposition license and thus cannot be copied at all outside the limits
  of fair use.
 .
  Images and graphics shown on this website are entirely covered by the
  exposition license.
 .
  If a proprietary vendor wishes to create a closed source object code
  based product using source covered by the derivative license they may
  do so. However if this vendor then wished to distribute the original
  source code, they may not apply any licensing terms which contradict
  the original derivative license covering the derivative code.
 .
  If your code is compatible with the old style BSD license and you
  wish to avoid the burden of explicitely protecting code you obtained
  from here from misrepresentation then you can simply cover it with
  the old-style BSD license.
 .
 It is therefore assumed that the relevant part of the Perl source
 is licensed under either the "Paul Hsieh derivative license" or
 the "the old-style BSD license", which have been included at
 the end of file with the codenames HSIEH-DERIVATIVE and HSIEH-BSD.
 .
 Additionally, the "hash.html" document has this statement for the
 relevant source code:
 .
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Since there has been a lot of interest for the code
  below, I have decided to additionally provide it under the LGPL 2.1
  license. This provision applies to the code below only and not to any
  other code including other source archives or listings from this site
  unless otherwise specified.
 .
  The LGPL 2.1 is not necessarily a more liberal license than my
  derivative license, but this additional licensing makes the code
  available to more developers. Note that this does not give you
  multi-licensing rights. You can only use the code under one of the
  licenses at a time.
 .

Comment:
 cpan/Compress-Raw-Bzip2/bzip2-src/README states:
  Note that the files bzip2.c, bzip2recover.c, bzlib.c & decompress.c
  have been modified to allow them to build with a C++ compiler.
  The file bzip2-src/bzip2-cpp.patch contains the patch
  that was used to modify the original source.
 but the patch has apparently been filtered out when including the software
 into the Perl core distribution.

Comment:
 The main license applies to most of the code:
 .
  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the same terms as Perl itself.
 .
 but portions of it have been taken from a BSD variant and are licensed
 under the terms of the "BSD-3-clause-GENERIC" license included in this file.
 .
 dist/PathTools/Cwd.pm states:
 .
  Portions of the C code in this library are copyright (c) 1994 by the
  Regents of the University of California.  All rights reserved.  The
  license on this code is compatible with the licensing of the rest of
  the distribution - please see the source code in F<Cwd.xs> for the
  details.
 .
 but, as discussed in
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=64116
 this is outdated and dist/PathTools/Cwd.xs itself contains the correct
 information.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
 Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
 Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)
 ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
 user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
 Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
 the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the
 Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version
 available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license
 that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the
 Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy
 that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the
 Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
 allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
 Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
 Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
 considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 terms of this license.
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
 made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to
 ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
 this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
 service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
 free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
 patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
 infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
 that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
 infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
 date that such litigation is filed.
 .
 (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
 OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

  original cannot possibly (by definition) be withheld from you. Also
  by definition, You (singular) have all the rights to this code
