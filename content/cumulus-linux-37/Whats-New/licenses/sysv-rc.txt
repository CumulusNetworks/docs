This package contains the mechanism for executing the right scripts
in the right order at bootup/shutdown time, and when changing runlevels.
It works through managing symlinks in /etc/rc?.d

This package is built from the `sysvinit' source package.  Please
consult the copyright file of the sysvinit package for the location of
the upstream sources of the sysvinit package.  Debian-specific files
for sysvinit, such as these initscripts, are maintained by the members
of the pkg-sysvinit project at alioth.debian.org.
