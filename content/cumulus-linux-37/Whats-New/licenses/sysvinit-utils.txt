This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of System V Init.

Init was written by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>.

This package was first put together by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com>
from pre-distribution sources. Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org>
integrated it into the base system maintained it until the end of 1995.
Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> implemented Debian support.
In version 2.85 the package was split into three (sysvinit, sysv-rc,
and initscripts) in order to make room for alternative rc mechanisms.
