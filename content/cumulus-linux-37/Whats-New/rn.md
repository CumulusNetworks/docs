| <a name="CM-31545"></a> [CM-31545](#CM-31545) <a name="CM-31545"></a> | In an MLAG configuration with a layer 3 VNI, when you bounce the peer link, all layer 2 VNIs listed under the layer 3 VNI are duplicated. <br/>To work around this issue, restart FRR with the `sudo systemctl restart frr.service` command. | 3.7.10-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31504"></a> [CM-31504](#CM-31504) <a name="CM-31504"></a> | On the the Dell N3248-PXE switch, when you insert two PSUs at different times, the newly inserted PSU is detected as OK but the fan and temp sensors are ABSENT.<br/>To work around this issue, remove power to both PSUs at the same time, then reinsert power simultaneously. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31475"></a> [CM-31475](#CM-31475) <a name="CM-31475"></a> | The following vulnerabilities have been announced in QEMU packages:<br/>CVE-2019-20382: Memory leak in zrle_compress_data in ui/vnc-enc-zrle.c during a VNC disconnect operation because libz is misused, resulting in a situation where memory allocated in deflateInit2 is not freed in deflateEnd.<br/>CVE-2020-13253: sd_wp_addr in hw/sd/sd.c uses an unvalidated address, which leads to an out-of-bounds read during sdhci_write() operations. A guest OS user can crash the QEMU process.<br/>CVE-2020-13754: hw/pci/msix.c allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access via a crafted address in an msi-x mmio operation.<br/>CVE-2020-14364: An out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice ‘setup_len’ exceeds its ‘data_buf<span class="error">&#91;4096&#93;</span>’ in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.<br/>CVE-2020-16092: An assertion failure can occur in the network packet processing. This issue affects the vmxnet3 network devices. A malicious guest user/process could use this flaw to abort the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition in net_tx_pkt_add_raw_fragment in hw/net/net_tx_pkt.c.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u16<br/>Fixed: 2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u17 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31454"></a> [CM-31454](#CM-31454) <a name="CM-31454"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in `libproxy`:<br/>CVE-2020-25219: There was a denial of service attack in libproxy, a library to make applications HTTP proxy aware. A remote server could cause an infinite stack recursion.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 0.4.11-4<br/>Fixed: 0.4.11-4+deb8u1 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31453"></a> [CM-31453](#CM-31453) <a name="CM-31453"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in python-pip:<br/>CVE-2019-20916: When an URL was given in an install command, as a Content-Disposition HTTP header was permitted to have ../ components in its filename, arbitrary local files (eg. /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) could be overidden.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 1.5.6-5<br/>Fixed: 1.5.6-5+deb8u1 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31420"></a> [CM-31420](#CM-31420) <a name="CM-31420"></a> | On a Cumulus Linux switch with high load averages, cl-support might end without creating a tar file  and leave a temporary directory in `/var/support` undeleted. Subsequent runs of cl-support do not clean up this directory. | 3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31407"></a> [CM-31407](#CM-31407) <a name="CM-31407"></a> | You cannot configure SNMPv3 trap-destinations in non-default VRFs with an authentication username that contains fewer than eight characters. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |

Applications that use this library may be vulnerable to memory not being<br/>freed leading to a denial of service.<br/>CVE-2020-24977: Out-of-bounds read restricted to xmllint --htmlout.<br/>CVE-2020-7595: Infinite loop in xmlStringLenDecodeEntities can cause a denial of service.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u8<br/>Fixed: 2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u9 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31377"></a> [CM-31377](#CM-31377) <a name="CM-31377"></a> | The following vulnerabilities have been announced in libjpeg-turbo:<br/>CVE-2020-13790: Heap-based buffer over-read via a PPM input file.<br/>CVE-2020-14152: Improper handling of max_memory_to_use setting can lead to excessive memory consumption.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 1.3.1-12+deb8u2<br/>Fixed: 1.3.1-12+deb8u3 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31327"></a> [CM-31327](#CM-31327) <a name="CM-31327"></a> | After you manually edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to change or remove a VRF for a given DNS server, `ifreload` does not remove IP rules created for DNS servers in the VRF. <br/>To work around this issue, run the `net add/del dns nameserver <span class="error">&#91;vrf <name>&#93;</span>` command to force the DNS configuration. | 3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31322"></a> [CM-31322](#CM-31322) <a name="CM-31322"></a> | SNMP status might incorrectly reflect that a BGP neighbor is down due to an issue between `bgpd` and SNMP AgentX when the IP-FORWARD-MIB is also polled.<br/>To work around this issue, avoid polling IP-FORWARD-MIB objects. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31321"></a> [CM-31321](#CM-31321) <a name="CM-31321"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in the libx11 libraries:<br/>CVE-2020-14363: Integer overflow in the init_om function of libX11, the X11 client-side library, which could lead to a double free.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 1.6.2-3+deb8u3<br/>Fixed: 1.6.2-3+deb8u4 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31300"></a> [CM-31300](#CM-31300) <a name="CM-31300"></a> | If a neighbour contains a special character in PortID for LLDP, the `net show interface` command does not display the LLDP information or the command might fail. | 3.7.10-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31294"></a> [CM-31294](#CM-31294) <a name="CM-31294"></a> | When all the following conditions exist, `clagd` might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094): <ul>	<li>`clagd` uses an IPv6 link-local address (LLA) to establish the TCP connection (the `clagd-peer-ip linklocal` command configures an IPv6 LLA connection)</li>	<li>`bridge-ports` has `peerlink` as the first member port (the bridge inherits the MAC address of peerlink bond. VLAN interfaces inherit the MAC address of the bridge. For example:<br /><pre>auto bridge<br />iface bridge<br />        bridge-vlan-aware yes<br />        bridge-ports peerlink-3 hostbond4 hostbond5 regex vx-.* regex vni.*<br /></pre><br /></li>	<li>You delete the SVI (layer 2 VNI)<br/>This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is deleted because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.<br/>To workaround this issue, use IPv4 addresses under `peerlink.4094` and configure `clagd` to peer on IPv4 addresses.</li></ul> | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31274"></a> [CM-31274](#CM-31274) <a name="CM-31274"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in the `apache2` package:<br/>CVE-2020-11985: apache2 was vulnerable to IP address spoofing when proxying using mod_remoteip and mod_rewrite.<br/>For configurations using proxying with mod_remoteip and certain mod_rewrite rules, an attacker could spoof their IP address for logging and PHP scripts.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 2.4.10-10+deb8u16<br/>Fixed: 2.4.10-10+deb8u17 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31273"></a> [CM-31273](#CM-31273) <a name="CM-31273"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in the bind9 packages:<br/>CVE-2020-8622: Crafted responses to TSIG-signed requests could lead to an assertion failure, causing named, a Domain Name Server, to exit. This could be done by malicious server operators or guessing attackers.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u19<br/>Fixed: 9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u20 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31272"></a> [CM-31272](#CM-31272) <a name="CM-31272"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in the nss / libnss3 packages:<br/>CVE-2020-12403: The ChaCha20 symmetric key cipher algorithm did not correctly enforce the tag length which may have led to an out-of-bounds read and a lack of confidentiality.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 3.26-1+debu8u12<br/>Fixed: 3.26-1+debu8u13 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31263"></a> [CM-31263](#CM-31263) <a name="CM-31263"></a> | RX_DRP on a bond interface increases without any data traffic while the slave port does not increase. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31257"></a> [CM-31257](#CM-31257) <a name="CM-31257"></a> | On the EdgeCore AS-6712-32X switch, the temp sensors (DIMM temp sensor) show ABSENT. The amber diagnostic light on the front of the switch might also be turned on due to this issue.<br/>These messages and the light are cosmetic issues only and do not otherwise impact the function of the switch. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31238"></a> [CM-31238](#CM-31238) <a name="CM-31238"></a> | IPv6 TCP or UDP connections (sourcing from an ephemeral port in the range 34048 to 35071) are not forwarded if the switch has more than one layer 2 VNI defined. The traffic might be locally switched on the bridge and dropped. <br/>To work around this issue, disable ARP/ND suppression to remove the internal ACL rule that affects the ports. | 3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31210"></a> [CM-31210](#CM-31210) <a name="CM-31210"></a> | CVE-2020-14350: In PostgreSQL 9.4, an uncontrolled search path could allow users to run arbitrary SQL functions with elevated priviledges when a superuser runs certain 'CREATE EXTENSION’ statements.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 9.4.26-0+deb8u2<br/>Fixed: 9.4.26-0+deb8u3 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

| <a name="CM-31150"></a> [CM-31150](#CM-31150) <a name="CM-31150"></a> | On the Mellanox SN2410 switch, you see `switchd` core and `GBIN_MALLOC` errors.<br/>To work around this issue, restart `switchd`. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31148"></a> [CM-31148](#CM-31148) <a name="CM-31148"></a> | Counters for IPROUTER rules do not increase when traffic is forwarded to the CPU because there is no IP neighbor. | 3.7.2-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31130"></a> [CM-31130](#CM-31130) <a name="CM-31130"></a> | The following vulnerabilities have been announced in the `ghostscript` package, which is available for optional installation.

| <a name="CM-31120"></a> [CM-31120](#CM-31120) <a name="CM-31120"></a> | In a traditional bridge configuration with `ip-forward off`, neighbors are synchronized to hardware with a `switchd` restart but are cleared when you flap the bridge interface. | 3.7.10-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31086"></a> [CM-31086](#CM-31086) <a name="CM-31086"></a> | When you add a member to a bond that has a subinterface configured (such as peerlink.4094), the new member is assigned only the VLAN of the subinterface for forwarding.<br/>To work around this issue, bounce the bond or shutdown the new interface and use the remaining members over the bond. | 3.7.10-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31073"></a> [CM-31073](#CM-31073) <a name="CM-31073"></a> | When you set the `sysctl` settings `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra_defrtr` (to prevent acceptance of IPv6 default route advertisements) and `net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra_defrtr` (set for newly created interfaces), if you create a new virtual interface, any pre-existing interface does not start accepting IPv6 default route avertisements again.<br/>To work around this issue, when you create a new virtual interface, set `net.ipv6.conf.<interface>.accept_ra_defrtr` to 0 for all interfaces and run `sysctl -p --system`. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31057"></a> [CM-31057](#CM-31057) <a name="CM-31057"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced:<br/>CVE-2019-11360: A buffer overflow in `iptables-restore` in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to `add_param_to_argv` in `xshared.c`. | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-31055"></a> [CM-31055](#CM-31055) <a name="CM-31055"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced:<br/>CVE-2019-20892: net-snmp before 5.8.1.pre1 has a double free in usm_free_usmStateReference in snmplib/snmpusm.c via an SNMPv3 GetBulk request. <br/>Fixed:  5.8.0-cl4.2.1u1,  5.8.0-cl3.7.14u1 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

The list of CVEs is:<br/>CVE-2017-12805 CVE-2017-17681 CVE-2017-18252 CVE-2018-7443 CVE-2018-8804 CVE-2018-8960 CVE-2018-9133 CVE-2018-10177 CVE-2018-18024 CVE-2018-20467 CVE-2019-10131 CVE-2019-11472 CVE-2019-12977 CVE-2019-12978 CVE-2019-12979 CVE-2019-13300 CVE-2019-13307 CVE-2019-13454<br/>Vulnerable: <= 6.8.9.9-5+deb8u19<br/>Fixed: 6.8.9.9-5+deb8u20 | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-30879"></a> [CM-30879](#CM-30879) <a name="CM-30879"></a> | NCLU restarts FRR when removing a BGP VRF IPv4 aggregate-address command. | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-30863"></a> [CM-30863](#CM-30863) <a name="CM-30863"></a> | OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>-The user is authorized to `scp` but not `ssh` (based on the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses `scp -r` to copy over to the target computer.<br/>Be aware that restricting users to `scp` by using the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>If you want to use `scp -r` to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in `No buffer space available` error messages on protocol sockets.<br/>When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a `switchd` restart. | 3.4.3-3.7.13 | |

| <a name="CM-21898"></a> [CM-21898](#CM-21898) | On a Trident3 switch, IGMP packets are not policed by the police rule in the 00control ACL file. The packets are policed by the catchall policer in the 99control ACL file instead. <br/> `-A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100` <br/>To work around this issue, let the CPU bound IGMP packet hit the following rule and change the policer rate to a desired value for IGMP packets: <br/> `-A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100` <br/>Typically, the destination MAC address 01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx is used only for PIM/IGMP control and data stream packets. However, this workaround cannot handle data stream multicast packets that are not TCP/UDP; this is not typically done.  | 3.6.2-3.7.12 | |

The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is deleted because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.<br/>To workaround this issue, use IPv4 addresses under `peerlink.4094` and configure `clagd` to peer on IPv4 addresses.</li></ul> | 3.7.12-3.7.13 | |

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

| <a name="CM-18192"></a> [CM-18192](#CM-18192) <a name="CM-18192"></a> | In FRR, `bgp_snmp` does not show all BGP peers when peer groups used. | 3.7.11-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-17934"></a> [CM-17934](#CM-17934) <a name="CM-17934"></a> | FRR tracks interface speed based on the value it learns from the Linux kernel for that interface. If the interface speed changes, FRR does not update its interface speed cache. This can lead to issues for routing protocols that derive metrics from interface speed as the cost can become out of sync with the interface speed.<br/>To work around this issue, manually define the routing protocol metric for these interfaces or restart FRR. | 3.7.6-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-17557"></a> [CM-17557](#CM-17557) <a name="CM-17557"></a> | When sFlow is enabled, some sampled packets, such as IPMC, are forwarded twice (in the ASIC and then again through the kernel networking stack). | 3.4.0-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-17494"></a> [CM-17494](#CM-17494) <a name="CM-17494"></a> | In certain cases, a peer device sends an ARP request from a source IP address that is not on the connected subnet and the switch creates a STALE neighbor entry. Eventually, the switch attempts to keep the entry fresh and sends ARP requests to the host. If the host responds, the switch has REACHABLE neighbor entries for hosts that are not on the connected subnet. <br/>To work around this issue, change the value of `arp_ignore` to 2. See <a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-3/Address-Resolution-Protocol-ARP/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Address Resolution Protocol in the Cumulus Linux user guide</a> for more information. | 3.3.2-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-16855"></a> [CM-16855](#CM-16855) <a name="CM-16855"></a> | If a two nodes on both sides of a link change from auto-negotiation off to auto-negotiation on for both sides during a short interval (around one second), the link might start flapping or stay down.To work around this issue and stop the flapping, turn the link down on the switch with the command ifdown swpX, wait a few seconds, then bring the link back up with the command ifup swpX. Repeat this on the other side if necessary. | 3.3.2-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-16571"></a> [CM-16571](#CM-16571) <a name="CM-16571"></a> | NCLU cannot manage `rsyslog` to addresses routed via a VRF.  In Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and later, management VRF is enabled by default.   To work around this issue, update the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to disable management VRF. | 3.4.3-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-16461"></a> [CM-16461](#CM-16461) <a name="CM-16461"></a> | After booting a Cumulus VX virtual machine running the VMware OVA image, sometimes messages from sensors appear, indicating that the "Avg state" is critical, with all values displayed as 100.0. A cl-support is generated. | 3.4.2-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-15812"></a> [CM-15812](#CM-15812) <a name="CM-15812"></a> | Multicast forwarding fails for IP addresses whose DMAC overlaps with reserved DIPs. | 3.2.1-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-15601"></a> [CM-15601](#CM-15601) <a name="CM-15601"></a> | On a Mellanox switch in an MLAG configuration, routed packets that arrive on one switch to be forwarded to a destination MAC across the peer link are dropped due to MLAG loop prevention. This affects both routed unicast and multicast packets. | 3.6.2-3.7.13 | |
| <a name="CM-15094"></a> [CM-15094](#CM-15094) <a name="CM-15094"></a> | Counter samples for an 80G bond (2 x 40G) exported from the switch show an interface speed (ifSpeed) of 14.464Gbps.  | 3.2.0-3.7.13 | |

| <a name="CM-28313"></a> [CM-28313](#CM-28313) | On the EdgeCore Wedge100 and Facebook Wedge-100S switch, certain physical ports are not correctly mapped to the logical ones. For example:<br/>Logical swp39 controls physical swp41<br/>Logical swp40 controls physical swp42<br/>Logical swp43 controls physical swp45<br/>Logical swp44 controls physical swp46<br/>This might causes incorrect forwarding behavior. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28276"></a> [CM-28276](#CM-28276) | When a Trident3 switch receives packets containing an IP checksum value that is not compliant with RFC 1624, the TTL is decremented after a routing operation but the checksum is not recalculated. This results in the IP checksum value being invalid as the packet leaves the switch.  | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |

| <a name="CM-28091"></a> [CM-28091](#CM-28091) | Two security issues were found in the Python interface to the apt package manager, which is installed by default on Cumulus Linux; package downloads from unsigned repositories were incorrectly rejected (CVE-2019-15796) and the hash validation relied on MD5 (CVE-2019-15795).<br/>For more information, refer to <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/python-apt" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/python-apt</a><br/>Vulnerable: 0.9.3.12<br/>Fixed: 0.9.3.13 | 3.0.0-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28087"></a> [CM-28087](#CM-28087) | The last eight ports of the EdgeCore AS4610-54P switch (swp41 through swp48) do not power UPOE access points. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28077"></a> [CM-28077](#CM-28077) | An unhandled exception might occur after you run the `sudo poectl -i` command. In addition, random `poed` daemon restarts can occur without any unhandled exceptions but with an invalid response length error. Both issues can occur due to a SerialException.<br/>To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. A software reboot does not resolve the issue. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28065"></a> [CM-28065](#CM-28065) | Editing the outbound route-map of a BGP peer causes all received prefixes by that BGP peer to reset and reinstall. This might cause a brief impact to traffic for those prefixes. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28048"></a> [CM-28048](#CM-28048) | On the Lenovo NE2580 switch, the fan speeds are higher than expected within normal operating conditions. | 3.7.11 | |

| <a name="CM-28016"></a> [CM-28016](#CM-28016) | On the Mellanox Spectrum switch, `switchd` can sometimes fail when PBR rules are installed or removed from hardware if the rule is setting a next hop learned via a routing protocol. | 3.7.7-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28007"></a> [CM-28007](#CM-28007) | When you configure Cumulus Linux with a /32 address on a switch port with a configured peer address (for example, to connect to a device using IP unnumbered), the switch sends GARPs for the peer address. | 3.7.5-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27947"></a> [CM-27947](#CM-27947) | Broadcom Field Alert - SID - MMU 2B Errors<br/>A few of the MMU memories on Broadcom switches are grouped together with single parity control. During SER correction when a parity error occurs on one of those groups, other memory in that group might also report a SER error. This occurs when the memory is accessed either by a packet hit or through a schan operation. This issue can cause SER errors in other memory and cause traffic mis-forwarding or a packet drop. | 3.7.0-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27927"></a> [CM-27927](#CM-27927) | On the Delta AG6248C switch, the NCLU `net show system sensors` command shows an error:<br /><pre>Could not collect output from command: &#91;'/usr/sbin/smonctl'&#93;<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, run the `net show system sensors json` command instead. | 3.7.11 | |

| <a name="CM-27683"></a> [CM-27683](#CM-27683) | The following CVEs were announced that affect the Linux kernel:<br/>CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>CVE-2019-20054: In the Linux kernel before 5.0.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table() in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c, related to put_links, aka CID-23da9588037e. | 3.0.0-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27670"></a> [CM-27670](#CM-27670) | A memory leak in `switchd` might occur, which causes `switchd` to restart. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27644"></a> [CM-27644](#CM-27644) | Ifupdown2 does not set up the front panel interface for the `dhclient` to accept the DHCP OFFER.<br/>To work around this issue, restart the networking service after `ifreload -a` with the `systemctl restart networking` command. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27525"></a> [CM-27525](#CM-27525) | On the Delta AG6248C PoE switch, if the PoE priority is set to low on some ports, other ports with a higher priority might have their requests to draw power rejected instead of the lower priority ports being brought down. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27507"></a> [CM-27507](#CM-27507) | The `ports.conf` file on the Dell S5248F-ON switch does not show port ganging or breakout options. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27496"></a> [CM-27496](#CM-27496) | All Broadcom Trident3 X7 switches contain PCIE firmware, which is programmed by the vendor when the switch is manufactured. The latest version of this firmware (2.6) is incompatible with Cumulus Linux 3.7.11 and earlier, and Cumulus Linux 4.0. <br/>To work around this issue, downgrade the Broadcom ASIC firmware to an earlier version. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27444"></a> [CM-27444](#CM-27444) | If you use the NCLU commands to configure NTP and run the `net add time ntp source <interface>` command before you run the `net add time ntp server <server> iburst` command, the `/etc/ntp.conf` file is misconfigured.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `net add time ntp server <server> iburst` command before you run the `net add time ntp source <interface>` command. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27295"></a> [CM-27295](#CM-27295) | IPv6 table rules might affect forwarding. For example, if you create the following rule in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/03-sshd.rules` file, the rule counter increments but IPv4 SSH traffic might be dropped.<br /><pre>&#91;ip6tables&#93;<br />-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27120"></a> [CM-27120](#CM-27120) | When an interface flap occurs, numbered IPv6 BGP sessions might fail to establish.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `ip -6 route flush cache <IPv6-address>` command to flush the IPv6 route cache. | 3.7.9-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-26894"></a> [CM-26894](#CM-26894) | The `neighmgrd` service does not ignore neighbors on reserved devices (lo and management devices).  This issue is not seen when management VRF is enabled. | 3.7.8-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-26839"></a> [CM-26839](#CM-26839) | On the Dell S5248F-ON switch, CPU core temp sensors may show as ABSENT. |  | |
| <a name="CM-26351"></a> [CM-26351](#CM-26351) | After you remove a subinterface, the BGP session stays in a Connect state. | 3.7.8-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-26241"></a> [CM-26241](#CM-26241) | On the Dell S5248F-ON switch, `smond` might generate syslog messages indicating that the fan input RPM is lower than the normal low speed of 2500 RPM. Speeds as low as 1700 RPM are acceptable in normal thermal environments; therefore, you can ignore these messages. | 3.7.6-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-25665"></a> [CM-25665](#CM-25665) | On the Broadcom Trident 3 switch, VXLAN encapsulated packets are dropped on the ingress port (tagged layer 2 port) during transit forwarding (the local switch does not terminate the VXLAN tunnel). An example of where this two-layer VXLAN inside VXLAN encapsulation might occur:<ul class="alternate" type="square">	<li>VXLAN tunnel (#1) between two servers (different racks) to provide layer 2 extension for containers or VM hosts.</li>	<li>VXLAN tunnel (#2) between the TOR switch in rack 1 to the TOR switch located in the remote rack.</li></ul>To work around this issue, either:<ul class="alternate" type="square">	<li>Configure the edge port (facing the servers) to be an access port (instead of a trunk/tagged port)</li>	<li>Change the destination port from 4789 to something else (VXLAN tunnel terminated by the servers)</li></ul> | 3.7.5-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-22591"></a> [CM-22591](#CM-22591) | CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack) is a network vulnerability where an attacker can trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly with specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service. On a Cumulus Linux switch, the impact is limited to control plane and management plane traffic. Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.<br/>To work around this issue, create a file called `/etc/sysctl.d/ip.conf` and add these settings:<br /><pre>net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.11 | |

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting.

You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>To check if `lldpd` is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu \| head<br /></pre><br />Alternatively, check for messages in the `/var/log/syslog` directory similar to:<br /><pre>2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd<br /></pre><br /><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for `lldpd` to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:<ul>	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the `bridge-vids` list to include the VLANs being used).</li>	<li>Stop the `lldpd` service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the `lldpd` service (runtime setting), run the `sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service` command.

Without this header, when you use the `apt upgrade` command to upgrade Linux packages, `uboot` is unable to boot up the kernel. <br/>To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the Cumulus Linux image. Run the `onie-select` command to go into ONIE, and then use the `nos-install` command in ONIE to install a new image.<br/>This workaround only works when an out-of-band network is present. | 3.7.11-3.7.13 | |

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.<br/>To work around this issue, create a file called `/etc/sysctl.d/ip.conf` and add these settings:<br /><pre>net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.11 | 3.7.12-3.7.13|

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether.

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | |

| <a name="CM-25783"></a> [CM-25783](#CM-25783) | Cumulus Linux installer images have a shell script that validates checksum integrity. When you run `onie-install`, this check is run but the installer is still staged even if the checksum validation fails. <br/> To work around this issue, perform your own checksum validation before staging a new image with `onie-install`.  | 3.7.7-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25770"></a> [CM-25770](#CM-25770) | On a Tomahawk switch, the 5m 40G DACs (40G CR4) do not come up when both sides have auto-negotiation enabled. | 3.7.7-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25754"></a> [CM-25754](#CM-25754) | A port that is used as both a double tag interface and a VXLAN access side interface does not forward correctly; VXLAN decapsulation is does not occur.  However, do not configure double tagged interfaces on VXLAN uplink ports as this will cause VXLAN routing issues. | 3.6.2-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25735"></a> [CM-25735](#CM-25735) | When MLAG is re-establishing its peering after a member reboot, the VNIs on the peer briefly go into a protodown state. This can cause complete downtime to dually connected hosts as the member coming back up is still in `initDelay`. This issue does resolve itself as the VNIs do come back up within ten seconds.  | 3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25684"></a> [CM-25684](#CM-25684) | For interfaces configured with RS FEC, when `switchd` is restarted, the link goes down but does not automatically come back up. This occurs because the FEC status is not replayed correctly into the kernel. <br/> To work around this issue, run the `ifreload -a` command to bring up the interface after `switchd` is restarted.  | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25674"></a> [CM-25674](#CM-25674) | On Mellanox switches, policer iptables are not working as expected. For example, when using a policer with mode KB/MB/GB to rate-limit interfaces, the syntax is accepted but the data plane transfer speed is not affected by the rule.  | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25664"></a> [CM-25664](#CM-25664) | On the Trident3 platform, you can only add 50 percent of the total ECMP next hops. A log message indicates that the table is full.  | 3.7.7-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25646"></a> [CM-25646](#CM-25646) | When moving an IP address from the address line to `inet dhcp`, then issuing the `ifreload -a` command, the old address is not removed from the interface. NCLU still reports the old address only and reports it as a DHCP address.  | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25619"></a> [CM-25619](#CM-25619) | After configuring `switchd hal.bcm.per_vlan_router_mac_lookup` to TRUE on a Broadcom switch,  layer 2 traffic works over VXLAN but the host is not able to ping the locally connected gateway and loses routing ability to other IPs and subnets.  | 3.6.0-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25610"></a> [CM-25610](#CM-25610) | BGP update packets are sometimes missing the mandatory `nexthop` attribute, which causes connections to reset. For example, this issue is seen when using VRF route leaking with a mix of BGP unnumbered and BGP numbered peers.  | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25489"></a> [CM-25489](#CM-25489) | When BGP `remove-private-AS replace-AS` is configured under the BGP IPv4 or IPv6 address family between a pair of switches configured as BGP peers, a BGP route update might cause the BGP session to flap. <br/> To work around this issue, do not configure `remove-private-AS replace-AS` in the BGP IPv4 or IPv6 address family. | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25488"></a> [CM-25488](#CM-25488) | On Broadcom-based VXLAN routing capable platforms, VXLAN traffic received at the egress VTEP might drop because the hardware is mis-programming. This issue is related to timing and is not easily reproduced. <br/> This issue might occur after a VXLAN interface (VNI) state transition (the peerlink goes down and puts VNI into a protodown state, then the peerlink comes back and the VNI returns to UP) and is related to how the next-hop information is programmed in hardware. Sometimes the host routes corresponding to this VXLAN segment are mis-programmed with the wrong next hop information. <br/> To work around this issue, restart the `switchd` service with the `sudo systemctl restart switchd.service` command.  |  | |
| <a name="CM-25467"></a> [CM-25467](#CM-25467) | The following CVEs were announced in Debian Security Advisory DSA-4472-1 and affect the expat (libexpat1) package. <br/> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/> Debian Security Advisory DSA-4472-1 security&#64;debian.org <br/> <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.debian.org/security/</a> Salvatore Bonaccorso <br/> June 28, 2019 <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/faq" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.debian.org/security/faq</a> <br/> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/> Package: expat <br/> CVE ID: CVE-2018-20843 <br/> Debian Bug: 931031 <br/> It was discovered that Expat, an XML parsing C library, did not properly handled XML input including XML names <br/> that contain a large number of colons, potentially resulting in denial of service. <br/> For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 2.2.0-2+deb9u2. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of expat, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/expat" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/expat</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25432"></a> [CM-25432](#CM-25432) | The `snmpd` service frequently crashes due to `double free or corruption`.  | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25417"></a> [CM-25417](#CM-25417) | The IP neighbor entry for a link-local next hop (169.254.x.x) is not installed by FRR, which results in a forwarding failure for routes via that next hop. This is a rare problem that occurs with IPv4 route exchange over IPv6 GUA peering with no IPv4 addresses on the interfaces. <br/> To work around this issue, flap the peering to the peer router (which can be a route reflector) to recover. To avoid this issue, configure IPv6 router advertisements on the connecting interfaces. | 3.7.7-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25414"></a> [CM-25414](#CM-25414) | On the Mellanox SN2410 switch, `switchd` does not start.  | 3.7.2-3.7.8 | |

| <a name="CM-25358"></a> [CM-25358](#CM-25358) | When you configure the `link-down yes` attribute to a physical SVI, the VRR (-v0) interface is not brought down, and the locally-connected subnet can still be redistributed into routing protocols and advertised to neighbors despite the physical SVI being administratively down. <br/> To work around this issue, manually bring down the VRR (-v0) interface with the `ip link set dev` command. For example:  <br /><pre>  cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo ip link set dev vlan1755-v0 down  </pre><br />  | 3.6.1-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25343"></a> [CM-25343](#CM-25343) | The following CVEs were announced in Debian Security Advisory DSA-4465-1 and affect the linux kernel. <br/> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/> Debian Security Advisory DSA-4465-1 security&#64;debian.org <br/> <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.debian.org/security/</a> Salvatore Bonaccorso <br/> June 17, 2019 <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/faq" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.debian.org/security/faq</a> <br/> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/> Package: linux <br/> CVE ID: CVE-2019-3846 CVE-2019-5489 CVE-2019-9500 CVE-2019-9503 CVE-2019-10126 CVE-2019-11477 <br/> CVE-2019-11478 CVE-2019-11479 CVE-2019-11486 CVE-2019-11599 CVE-2019-11815 CVE-2019-11833 CVE-2019-11884 <br/> Debian Bug: 928989 <br/> Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or <br/> information leaks. <br/> CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 <br/> huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of <br/> service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/> CVE-2019-5489 <br/> Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh <br/> discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access <br/> the same memory-mapped file. <br/> CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 <br/> Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), <br/> which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/> CVE-2019-11477 <br/> Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely <br/> triggerable kernel panic. <br/> CVE-2019-11478 <br/> Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP <br/> retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. <br/> CVE-2019-11479 <br/> Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, <br/> each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. <br/> This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the <br/> formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. <br/> CVE-2019-11486 <br/> Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to <br/> cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. <br/> CVE-2019-11599 <br/> Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local <br/> user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-11815 <br/> It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially <br/> privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/> it is explicitly loaded. <br/> CVE-2019-11833 <br/> It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/> A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/> able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-11884 <br/> It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/> A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/> For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |
| <a name="CM-25295"></a> [CM-25295](#CM-25295) | The `ifquery` command should return a non-zero value if there is a syntax error. However, it currently returns zero. This issue affects automation scripts that validate a file before copying it into place. | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | |

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.

It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. <br/> CVE-2019-11486 <br/> Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to <br/> cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. <br/> CVE-2019-11599 <br/> Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local <br/> user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-11815 <br/> It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially <br/> privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/> it is explicitly loaded. <br/> CVE-2019-11833 <br/> It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/> A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/> able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-11884 <br/> It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/> A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/> For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/> it is explicitly loaded. <br/> CVE-2019-11833 <br/> It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/> A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/> able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-11884 <br/> It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/> A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/> For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

| <a name="CM-25415"></a> [CM-25415](#CM-25415) | In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. <br/> The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated. <br/> To work around this issue, configure the BGP peering on a <em>new</em> VLAN interface (for example, vlan4093) instead of the peer link sub-interface (peerlink.4094).  | 3.7.6 | |

Packets destined out this tunnel are dropped in the egress direction. Packets arriving on this tunnel are dropped in the ingress direction. This is due to a race condition between ASIC and kernel programming that causes the kernel to incorrectly process the link state of a VXLAN interface. <br/> To work around this issue, you can bounce the layer 3 SVI for the affected VRF. For example:  <br /><pre>  ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123  </pre><br />  Run the net `show vrf vni` command to show a mapping of the layer 3 VNI to layer 3 SVI for the VRF. <br/> <b>Note</b>: This workaround is not guaranteed because the race condition cannot be always be avoided.  | 3.7.4-3.7.6 | |

| <a name="CM-20222"></a> [CM-20222](#CM-20222) | During system boot, Cumulus Linux reads the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to obtain the port speed. The port speed is programmed into the ASIC and synchronized to the kernel. After system boot, the kernel speed shows correctly as it matches the ASIC speed that is derived from the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file and the cable type. However, if you restart `switchd` without rebooting the system, `switchd` synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel. Consequently, the kernel speed remains at the pre-existing (incorrect) speed.  | 3.6.2-3.7.6 | |

The NetQ agent will be bundled with Cumulus Linux in a future release. | 3.4.3-3.7.6 | |
| <a name="CM-14975"></a> [CM-14975](#CM-14975) | On Dell S6000 switches, `switchd` CPU utilization is high (50% and above) even when there is no configuration and it is idle.  | 3.2.1-3.7.6 | |
| <a name="CM-12967"></a> [CM-12967](#CM-12967) | When link pause or priority flow control (PFC) is enabled on a Broadcom Tomahawk-based switch and there is over-subscription on a link, the ASIC sends pause frames aggressively, causing the upstream switch to not throttle enough. <br/>If you need link pause or PFC functionality, you must use a switch that does not use the Tomahawk ASIC. | 3.1.0-3.7.6 | |

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9.

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions.

It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.

It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver.

This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/> it is explicitly loaded. <br/> CVE-2019-11833 <br/> It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/> A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/> able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-11884 <br/> It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/> A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/> For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.7.6-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

The port speed is programmed into the ASIC and synchronized to the kernel. After system boot, the kernel speed shows correctly as it matches the ASIC speed that is derived from the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file and the cable type. However, if you restart `switchd` without rebooting the system, `switchd` synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

The port speed is programmed into the ASIC and synchronized to the kernel. After system boot, the kernel speed shows correctly as it matches the ASIC speed that is derived from the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file and the cable type. However, if you restart `switchd` without rebooting the system, `switchd` synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

| <a name="CM-30863"></a> [CM-30863](#CM-30863) <a name="CM-30863"></a> | OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>-The user is authorized to `scp` but not `ssh` (based on the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses `scp -r` to copy over to the target computer.<br/>Be aware that restricting users to `scp` by using the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>If you want to use `scp -r` to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions.

It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.

A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver.

However, if you restart `switchd` without rebooting the system, `switchd` synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

When you change the port speed in the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

While this forwarding entry is programmed, this device cannot properly decapsulate VXLAN packets, which results in these packets being discarded. <br/> To work around this issue, make sure that the VLAN ID (SVI used for the layer 3 VNI) is <b>not</b> part of the bridge in an MLAG configuration. This ensures that traffic tagged with that VLAN ID is not forwarded on the peer link or other trunks.  | 3.7.2 | |

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.

It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether.

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

| <a name="CM-20222"></a> [CM-20222](#CM-20222) <a name="CM-20222"></a> | During system boot, Cumulus Linux reads the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to obtain the port speed. The port speed is programmed into the ASIC and synchronized to the kernel. After system boot, the kernel speed shows correctly as it matches the ASIC speed that is derived from the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file and the cable type. However, if you restart `switchd` without rebooting the system, `switchd` synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13 | |

If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/> The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/> capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2018-5995 <br/> ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/> exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/> CVE-2018-20836 <br/> chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/> to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/> allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-1999 <br/> A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-1125 <br/> It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/> from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.

It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/> limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/> CVE-2019-3882 <br/> It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/> a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/> CVE-2019-3900 <br/> It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/> guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/> CVE-2019-10207 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/> to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-10638 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/> tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/> now used instead. <br/> CVE-2019-10639 <br/> Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/> virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/> CVE-2019-12817 <br/> It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/> process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/> memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/> with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/> CVE-2019-12984 <br/> It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/> pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/> CVE-2019-13233 <br/> Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/> CVE-2019-13631 <br/> It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/> descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> CVE-2019-13648 <br/> Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/> restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> CVE-2019-14283 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/> disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/> CVE-2019-14284 <br/> The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/> use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/> (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/> The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/> XSA-300 <br/> Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/> "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/> For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/> For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/> We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/> For the detailed security status of linux, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.8 | 3.7.9-3.7.13|

However, if you restart `switchd` without rebooting the system, `switchd` synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.
