## 3.7.12 Release Notes
### Open issues in 3.7.12

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="CM-28992"></a> [CM-28992](#CM-28992) <a name="CM-28992"></a> | The following security vulnerability has been announced:<br/>CVE-2020-10531: An issue was discovered in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ through 66.1. An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, exists in the UnicodeString::doAppend() function in common/unistr.cpp. | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28968"></a> [CM-28968](#CM-28968) <a name="CM-28968"></a> | The EVPN `advertise-svi-ip` command does not withdraw routes.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `systemctl restart frr.service` command. | 3.7.9-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28944"></a> [CM-28944](#CM-28944) <a name="CM-28944"></a> | A change in a route map prefix list that should remove a route might not be reflected in the ospf6 database or in peers, and the route might not be deleted. <br/>To work around this issue, reenter the `redistribute <connected\|static> route-map <route-map-name>` statement in the configuration. | 3.6.2-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28940"></a> [CM-28940](#CM-28940) <a name="CM-28940"></a> | If you configure `aggregate-address <address> summary-only` before a component of the same aggregate is injected into the BGP table with the `network` or `redistribute` command, when you remove the `aggregate-address` configuration, the component stays suppressed; it is not advertised to peers. For example:<br/>Existing configuration:<br /><pre>router bgp 1<br /> address-family ipv4 unicast<br />  aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only<br /> exit-address-family<br /></pre><br />If you add `network 50.0.0.1/32`, you see the following (expected) BGP table entries:<br /><pre>Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath,<br />              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed<br />Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete<br />   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path<br />*> 50.0.0.0         0.0.0.0                            32768 i<br />s> 50.0.0.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i<br /></pre><br />Removing `aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only` at this point results in the following (unexpected) BGP table entry:<br /><pre>Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath,<br />              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed<br />Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete<br />   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path<br />s> 50.0.0.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, remove, then re-add the component prefix routes. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28938"></a> [CM-28938](#CM-28938) <a name="CM-28938"></a> | When you install an ACL LOG/DROP rule on a layer 3 ingress interface that is a member of a VRF, traffic that matches this rule is not logged and is still forwarded.<br/>To work around this issue, apply the ACL LOG/DROP rule to the VRF device itself or to the layer 2 VNI. | 3.7.6-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28867"></a> [CM-28867](#CM-28867) <a name="CM-28867"></a> | The QuantaMesh BMS T3048-LY8 switch shows a low fan RPM in syslog. | 3.7.5-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28816"></a> [CM-28816](#CM-28816) <a name="CM-28816"></a> | The following security advisory has been announced for bash: <br/>CVE-2019-18276 Qualys scan QID 372268 setuid vulnerability<br/>When bash or bash scripts are run setuid, bash is supposed to drop privileges, but does so incorrectly, so that an attacker with command access to the shell can use `enable -f` for runtime loading of a new builtin that calls `setuid()` to regain dropped privileges.<br/>To work around this issue, do not make bash or bash scripts `setuid`. | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28754"></a> [CM-28754](#CM-28754) <a name="CM-28754"></a> | On switches with the Trident2+ ASIC, adding SPAN rules disables PBR rules. | 3.7.3-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28658"></a> [CM-28658](#CM-28658) <a name="CM-28658"></a> | The OVSDB log contains duplicate MAC addresses with the well-known BFD MAC address (00:23:20:00:00:01). This is mainly cosmetic, but clutters the log. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28657"></a> [CM-28657](#CM-28657) <a name="CM-28657"></a> | The BFD session to the NSX controller sometimes remains down. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28656"></a> [CM-28656](#CM-28656) <a name="CM-28656"></a> | In OVSDB VLAN-aware mode, removing a VTEP binding on the NSX controller fails to clean up all interfaces associated with the logical switch. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28655"></a> [CM-28655](#CM-28655) <a name="CM-28655"></a> | When you remove, then re-add an NSX VTEP binding, the VXLAN VTEP interface is not recreated. | 3.6.1-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28613"></a> [CM-28613](#CM-28613) <a name="CM-28613"></a> | In EVPN Active-Active (MLAG) environments, rebooting one member of an MLAG pair should result in the local MAC mobility sequence number reverting to 0. Sometimes a reboot of one MLAG peer results in the local MAC mobility sequence number being set to a non-zero value despite that no more mobility events occur. This issue is cosmetic only, as BGP does not advertise the incorrect sequence number and forwarding entries correctly point to the remote VTEP where the MAC is now located. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28611"></a> [CM-28611](#CM-28611) <a name="CM-28611"></a> | In an EVPN Active-Active (MLAG) environment, sometimes a local-to-remote MAC mobility event results in the local sequence number appearing higher than the remote sequence number in zebra. This issue is cosmetic only, as BGP does not advertise the incorrect sequence number and forwarding entries correctly point to the remote VTEP where the MAC is now located. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28533"></a> [CM-28533](#CM-28533) <a name="CM-28533"></a> | On the Lenovo NE0152T switch, one power supply (PSU2) always show as ABSENT in smonctl. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28488"></a> [CM-28488](#CM-28488) <a name="CM-28488"></a> | The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28487"></a> [CM-28487](#CM-28487) <a name="CM-28487"></a> | The following CVE was announced for rsyslog:<br/>CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042<br/>`rsyslogd`, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>The default `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable `$UDPServerRun` or `$InputTCPServerRun`, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration. | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28465"></a> [CM-28465](#CM-28465) <a name="CM-28465"></a> | When you try to configure `link-down` on a parent interface of a subinterface configured in a VRF, you encounter an error. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28462"></a> [CM-28462](#CM-28462) <a name="CM-28462"></a> | On rare occasions, when you upgrade Cumulus Linux with the `apt-get upgrade` command, the upgrade fails and reports `No space left on device`. Checking the disk utilization shows that the disk is not full.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `apt-get upgrade` command again and reboot the device if prompted to complete the upgrade. | 3.7.10-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28451"></a> [CM-28451](#CM-28451) <a name="CM-28451"></a> | An error similar to the following shows in syslog:<br /><pre>2020-02-12T19:59:22.208012+08:00 leaf01 sx_sdk: RM_TABLE: No resources available to add 1 entries to KVD hash Table HW resource<br />2020-02-12T19:59:22.208124+08:00 leaf01 sx_sdk: PORT: __port_vport_fid_set err = (No More Resources)<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, reboot the switch. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28442"></a> [CM-28442](#CM-28442) <a name="CM-28442"></a> | PTM mis-detects incorrect hostnames of LLDP neighbors and does not fail them as expected. Instead they end up in an N/A cabling status. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28441"></a> [CM-28441](#CM-28441) <a name="CM-28441"></a> | If a LLDP neighbor advertises a `PortDescr` that contains commas, `ptmctl -d` splits the string on the commas and misplaces its components in other columns. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28393"></a> [CM-28393](#CM-28393) <a name="CM-28393"></a> | On the Dell S5232F-ON switch, EVPN and dynamic VRF route leaking results in the CPU forwarding traffic to newly-learned type-2 routes.<br/>To work around this issue, restart FRR. | 3.7.9-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28376"></a> [CM-28376](#CM-28376) <a name="CM-28376"></a> | On the Dell S5232F-ON switch, the output of `ledmgrd` shows `amber_blinking` but `smonctl` shows all OK. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28374"></a> [CM-28374](#CM-28374) <a name="CM-28374"></a> | When traffic from a double tag interface (facing a different site) is forwarded via VXLAN, the inner tag is not removed. The destination does not know this tag, so it discards it. | 3.7.8-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28372"></a> [CM-28372](#CM-28372) <a name="CM-28372"></a> | On the EdgeCore AS7326-56X switch, the default fan speed, which is defined in the thermal specification, results in excessive fan noise. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28371"></a> [CM-28371](#CM-28371) <a name="CM-28371"></a> | On the Lenovo NE0152T switch, one power supply (PSU2) always show as ABSENT in smonctl. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28340"></a> [CM-28340](#CM-28340) <a name="CM-28340"></a> | Mellanox switches with the Spectrum A0 ASIC that are integrated with VMware NSX experience BFD connectivity issues with service nodes. As a result, VXLAN tunnels do not work.<br/>Mellanox switches with the Spectrum A1 ASIC do *<b>not</b>* have this issue. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28331"></a> [CM-28331](#CM-28331) <a name="CM-28331"></a> | When you add a route map to advertise IPv4 unicast in a BGP EVPN configuration and the route map contains a set operation, BGP crashes. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28223"></a> [CM-28223](#CM-28223) <a name="CM-28223"></a> | The following security vulnerability has been announced in qemu, which is not installed by default on Cumulus Linux but is available in the repository for optional installation:<br/>CVE-2020-1711: block: iscsi: OOB heap access via an unexpected response of iSCSI Server | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28212"></a> [CM-28212](#CM-28212) <a name="CM-28212"></a> | The `hsflowd` service sends an undefined header protocol 0 in the sampled flow sample to the collector, which is not recognized by the sFlow tool. You see errors similar to the following:<br /><pre>Dec 20 08:43:27 netflow-nms sfcapd&#91;3991&#93;: SFLOW: readFlowSample_header() undefined headerProtocol = 0<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28160"></a> [CM-28160](#CM-28160) <a name="CM-28160"></a> | On the Broadcom Trident3 switch with DHCP relay, where the DHCP server is reachable through the EVPN overlay, DHCP discover packets forwarded to the CPU might appear corrupt and might not get forwarded. | 3.7.9-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28136"></a> [CM-28136](#CM-28136) <a name="CM-28136"></a> | The MLAG switch pair has VLANs defined that are not used on MLAG bonds. These VLANs still synchronize MAC addresses across to the peer switch. This results in log messages that indicate a MAC address is installed and the VLAN is not defined; for example:<br /><pre>RTM_NEWNEIGH with unconfigured vlan XXXX on port peerlink<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.10-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28086"></a> [CM-28086](#CM-28086) <a name="CM-28086"></a> | The `ospfd` daemon might crash with the following kernel trace: <br /><pre>2019-11-06T23:00:08.261749+09:00 cumulus ospfd&#91;5339&#93;: Assertion 'node' failed in file ospfd/ospf_packet.c, line 671, function ospf_write<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28080"></a> [CM-28080](#CM-28080) <a name="CM-28080"></a> | TACACS+ through ClearPass is not currently supported. Cumulus Linux sends authorization before authentication, but ClearPass does not accept an authorization before the user is authenticated. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28078"></a> [CM-28078](#CM-28078) <a name="CM-28078"></a> | On the Broadcom switch with the Trident3 ASC, packet priority remark values assigned from each internal CoS value continue to work with default values; if you change the internal CoS value, the change does not take effect. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28076"></a> [CM-28076](#CM-28076) <a name="CM-28076"></a> | After you hot swap a PSU, the `decode-syseeprom -t psuX` command shows the old PSU information (such as the serial number), until you run the `decode-syseeprom --init` command. | 3.6.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28061"></a> [CM-28061](#CM-28061) <a name="CM-28061"></a> | On switches with the Trident3 ASIC, PFC is not working as expected. If you set the PFC for only one CoS,  pause frames are sent for all CoS traffic. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28003"></a> [CM-28003](#CM-28003) <a name="CM-28003"></a> | The FRR service does not provide a way for automation to know if the configuration applied properly.<br/>To work around this issue, execute the `vtysh -f <file>` command in the automation file before starting the FRR service to validate the functional configuration and return an error code. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-27999"></a> [CM-27999](#CM-27999) <a name="CM-27999"></a> | On the EdgeCore AS7326-56X switch, the PSU fans show constant LOW warnings. | 3.7.10-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-27957"></a> [CM-27957](#CM-27957) <a name="CM-27957"></a> | If you have configured a higher number of ports and VLANs (ports x VLANs) or the switch is a lower-powered (CPU) platform, the `switchd` service might fail to send a `systemd keepalive` within the watchdog timeout value (2 minutes by default) and you see an error similar to the following:<br /><pre>bq. systemd&#91;1&#93;: switchd.service watchdog timeout (limit 2min)!<br /></pre><br />To workaround this issue, either reduce the number of configured interfaces and/or VLANs or increase the `systemd` timeout for `switchd.service`.<br/>To increase the `systemd` timeout:<ol>	<li>Edit the `/etc/systemd/system/switchd.service.d/override.conf` file and increase the `WatchdogSec` parameter.</li>	<li>Restart the `switchd` service with the `sudo systemctl restart switchd.service` command.<br/>`systemd` will attempt to restart the `switchd` service automatically (after the watchdog timeout). If the restart fails multiple times in a short time period, run the `sudo systemctl reset-failed` command followed by the `sudo systemctl restart switchd` command.</li></ol> | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-27937"></a> [CM-27937](#CM-27937) <a name="CM-27937"></a> | Debian security advisory DSA-4213 for qemu lists a number of security vulnerabilities.<br/><a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4213" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4213</a><br/>One of the listed vulnerabilities is still present in the latest upstream version 2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u12 (the others have been fixed):<br/>CVE-2017-15124 Daniel Berrange discovered that the integrated VNC server insufficiently restricted memory allocation, which could result in denial of service.<br/><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15124" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15124</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |

| <a name="CM-27620"></a> [CM-27620](#CM-27620) <a name="CM-27620"></a> | When using QinQ with a traditional bridge, if you enable the LLDP dot1 TLV option, you see the following suboptimal behavior:<ul>	<li>Both the inner and outer VLAN information is sent as part of VLAN TLVs in the LLDP packet.</li>	<li>If the outer VLAN ID is the same as the inner VLAN ID, only one VLAN TLV is sent with that VLAN ID in the LLDP packet.</li></ul> | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-27586"></a> [CM-27586](#CM-27586) <a name="CM-27586"></a> | CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and `lldpd` is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (<a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv</a>). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>To check if `lldpd` is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu \| head<br /></pre><br />Alternatively, check for messages in the `/var/log/syslog` directory similar to:<br /><pre>2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd<br /></pre><br /><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for `lldpd` to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:<ul>	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the `bridge-vids` list to include the VLANs being used).</li>	<li>Stop the `lldpd` service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.)

You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>To check if `lldpd` is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu \| head<br /></pre><br />Alternatively, check for messages in the `/var/log/syslog` directory similar to:<br /><pre>2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd<br /></pre><br /><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for `lldpd` to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:<ul>	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the `bridge-vids` list to include the VLANs being used).</li>	<li>Stop the `lldpd` service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the `lldpd` service (runtime setting), run the `sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service` command.

| <a name="CM-28488"></a> [CM-28488](#CM-28488) <a name="CM-28488"></a> | The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28487"></a> [CM-28487](#CM-28487) <a name="CM-28487"></a> | The following CVE was announced for rsyslog:<br/>CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042<br/>`rsyslogd`, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>The default `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable `$UDPServerRun` or `$InputTCPServerRun`, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration. | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |

There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9.

| <a name="CM-25505"></a> [CM-25505](#CM-25505) <a name="CM-25505"></a> | In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the `clagd` `init-delay` timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.<br/>The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by `clagd`.<br/>To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br/>In the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times.

This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in `No buffer space available` error messages on protocol sockets.<br/>When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues.

| <a name="CM-28488"></a> [CM-28488](#CM-28488) <a name="CM-28488"></a> | The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |

Similarly, an IP multicast packet might traverse the peer link and need to be routed. | 3.6.2-3.7.12 | |
