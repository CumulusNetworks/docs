This happens when there is a neighbor entry for the same /32 that we have also received a type-5 route for.  When the route is learned after the neighbor entry there is a timing condition that can be hit that will cause the neighbor entry to get removed from hardware when the route is installed in hardware.

This condition has been seen when customers re-use the VTEP IP on an interface inside of a vrf.  The neigh entry for the TEP IP is installed when a symmetric route is learned via that VTEP.  The Type-5 route for the TEP IP is learned in the VRF if the customer has redistributed it or advertised it within BGP in the VRF.</td>

<td>When you configure BGP {{aggregate-address summary-only}} and any component route within the summary updates, all component routes within the summary update in the RIB on the device advertising the summary. This condition might result in increased CPU usage.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast
   aggregate-address 10.10.0.0/16 summary-only
   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

   !

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .

<td>Received EVPN type-5 and type-2 MACIP routes are not installed in the kernel (and hardware) routing tables for the associated VRF, which causes traffic to be blackholed.

The routes that are not installed are seen as "inactive" in the routing subsystem (FRR) VRF routing table. This problem is rare and can occur only in EVPN configurations that have user-configured route targets (RTs) for tenant VRFs, and only following a restart of FRR.
To work around this issue, either restart the FRR service on the affected switch with the {{sudo systemctl restart frr.service}} command or bounce the layer 3 SVI for the affected VRF; for example:

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast
   aggregate-address 10.10.0.0/16 summary-only
   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

   !

   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS permit 20

Before:

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>When you configure BGP {{aggregate-address summary-only}} and any component route within the summary updates, all component routes within the summary update in the RIB on the device advertising the summary. This condition might result in increased CPU usage.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast
   aggregate-address 10.10.0.0/16 summary-only
   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

   redistribute static

   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS deny 10
    match ip address prefix-list NO-COMPONENTS
   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS permit 20

CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast

   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

CVE-2020-27750 A flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type unsigned char and math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27760 In GammaImage() of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the gamma value, it’s possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could lead to an impact to application availability.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>Package : sudo
CVE ID : CVE-2019-14287
Debian Bug : 942322
Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .
We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages. For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security tracker page at: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo
Vulnerable versions: &lt; 1.8.27-1+deb10u1
Fixed versions: &gt;= 1.8.27-1+deb10u1
To work around this iisue, disable (comment out) any sudoers entries in {{/etc/sudoers}} or files in {{/etc/sudoers.d}} that have entries with {{!root}} in them. Only root or other users with a uid of 0 that are affected.</td>

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast

After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

<td>Several security vulnerabilities were found in ImageMagick, a suite of image manipulation programs. An attacker could cause denial of service and execution of arbitrary code when a crafted image file is processed.
CVE-2020-19667 Stack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump in ReadXPMImage in coders/xpm.c
CVE-2020-25665 The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read later on in the routine. This could cause impact to reliability.
CVE-2020-25674 WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger.
CVE-2020-27560 ImageMagick allows Division by Zero in OptimizeLayerFrames in MagickCore/layer.c, which may cause a denial of service.
CVE-2020-27750 A flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type unsigned char and math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27760 In GammaImage() of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the gamma value, it’s possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could lead to an impact to application availability.
CVE-2020-27763 A flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27765 A flaw was found in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27773 A flaw was found in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type unsigned char or division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-29599 ImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

The u-boot-tools package is not installed on the switch by default, but is available in the repository for optional installation.  On Cumulus Linux 4, the version is at least 2019.01+dfsg-7.  However, the older versions available for optional installation on Cumulus Linux 3 may be vulnerable.

According to https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/u-boot , all except the following are fixed in 2019.01+dfsg-7:

CVE-2017-3225: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3225 says "Negligible security impact".
CVE-2017-3226: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3226 says "Negligible security impact".

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

CVE ID : CVE-2019-14287
Debian Bug : 942322
Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .
We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages. For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security tracker page at: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo

<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094):

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast

   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast

   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094):

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

To workaround this issue, use IPv4 addresses under {{peerlink.4094}} and configure {{clagd}} to peer on IPv4 addresses.</td>

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

CVE ID : CVE-2019-14287
Debian Bug : 942322
Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .
We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages. For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security tracker page at: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo
Vulnerable versions: &lt; 1.8.27-1+deb10u1

<td>A large number of flapping peers causes FRR to require a corresponding update to internal data structures that track peer information. Updating this internal data structure does not delete links that are down due to the flapping. The size of this array then grows to contain both current peers as well as peers that should have been deleted during the flap processing. The contents of this array is processed by FRR to poll the links, which consumes CPU for all items in the array. This additional polling consumes more CPU than necessary but has no functional impact.
To work around this issue, restart FRR.</td>

CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors ([https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv]). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

Before:

<td>The following vulnerabilities have been announced in bluez, the Linux Bluetooth protocol stack:
CVE-2019-8921: SDP infoleak; the vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking arbitrary heap data.
CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.

Before:

This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094): 
* {{clagd}} uses an IPv6 link-local address (LLA) to establish the TCP connection (the {{clagd-peer-ip linklocal}} command configures an IPv6 LLA connection)

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

To workaround this issue, use IPv4 addresses under {{peerlink.4094}} and configure {{clagd}} to peer on IPv4 addresses.</td>

{{bind9-host}} (containing only {{/usr/bin/host}}) and some libraries from the {{bind9}} source package are installed on the switch by default; the BIND server referred to in these vulnerabilities is not installed by default but is available in the repository for optional installation.
CVE-2020-8616: It was discovered that BIND does not sufficiently limit the number of fetches performed when processing referrals. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (performance degradation) or use the recursing server in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.
CVE-2020-8617: It was discovered that a logic error in the code which checks TSIG validity can be used to trigger an assertion failure, resulting in denial of service.

<td>The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.

CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).

CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042
{{rsyslogd}}, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.
Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\
The default {{/etc/rsyslog.conf}} file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable {{$UDPServerRun}} or {{$InputTCPServerRun}}, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration.

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active.

You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

Debian Bug : 942322
Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. 
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.

CVE-2019-8921: SDP infoleak; the vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking arbitrary heap data.
CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>

CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. 
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.

To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%
2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

Uboot needs a special header to boot the kernel, which is not present. Without this header, when you use the {{apt upgrade}} command to upgrade Linux packages, {{uboot}} is unable to boot up the kernel. 
To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the Cumulus Linux image. Run the {{onie-select}} command to go into ONIE, and then use the {{nos-install}} command in ONIE to install a new image.
This workaround only works when an out-of-band network is present.</td>

CVE ID : CVE-2019-14287
Debian Bug : 942322
Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .

CVE ID:  CVE-2019-1547 CVE-2019-1549 CVE-2019-1563
Three security issues were discovered in OpenSSL: A timing attack against
ECDSA, a padding oracle in PKCS7_dataDecode() and CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey()
and it was discovered that a feature of the random number generator (RNG)
intended to protect against shared RNG state between parent and child
processes in the event of a fork() syscall was not used by default.
Fixed version: 1.1.1d-0+deb10u1
We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

Two vulnerabilities were found in the WPA protocol implementation found in wpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).
CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

 Package: vim and neovim 
 CVE ID: CVE-2019-12735 
 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. 
 For the detailed security status, refer to the security tracker page at: 
 https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-12735 
 https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-12735.html 
 https://github.com/numirias/security/blob/master/doc/2019-06-04_ace-vim-neovim.md 
 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the {{vimrc}} file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. 
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: 
 :set modeline? 
 If vim returns {{nomodeline}}, you are _not_ vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your {{vimrc}} file: 
  
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
  
 modeline is enabled by default. 
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in {{.vimrc}} that set {{modelines}} or {{modeline}}.</td>

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

Debian Bug : 942322
Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .

<td>In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the {{clagd}} {{init-delay}} timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. 
In the {{/etc/frr/frr.conf}} file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: 
 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$

<td>When you use NCLU to configure a route map, the parser allows for glob matching of interfaces for a _match interface_ condition when there can only be a single interface matched. The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. 
 For example, this command is incorrect: 
  
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10

CVE-2019-8921: SDP infoleak; the vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking arbitrary heap data.
CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

CVE ID : CVE-2019-14287
Debian Bug : 942322
Joe Vennix discovered that sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user privileges to specific users, when configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, allows to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This could allow a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access.
Details can be found in the upstream advisory at https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html .
We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages. For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security tracker page at: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo

CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

<td>In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the {{clagd}} {{init-delay}} timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. 
In the {{/etc/frr/frr.conf}} file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: 
 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ 

route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 
match as-path MY_ASN 
set as-path prepend 4200000101

<td>At a high CPU transmit traffic rate (for example, if there is unexpected CPU generated flooding or replication in software), when the ASIC packet driver cannot keep up with the transmit rate because there are no free DMA buffers, it can back pressure by suspending the switch port transmit queues. This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in {{No buffer space available}} error messages on protocol sockets.
When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a {{switchd}} restart.</td>

 CVE ID: CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 
 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. 
 CVE-2015-8553 
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. 
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. 
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) 
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN 
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2018-5995 
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to 
 exploit other vulnerabilities. 
 CVE-2018-20836 
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead 
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. 
 CVE-2019-1125 
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel 
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could 
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. 
 CVE-2019-1999 
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-1125 
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel 
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could 
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to 
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. 
 CVE-2019-3882 
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of 
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). 
 CVE-2019-3900 
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious 
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. 
 CVE-2019-10207 
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access 
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). 
 CVE-2019-10638 
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable 
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is 
 now used instead. 
 CVE-2019-10639 
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel 
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. 
 CVE-2019-12817 
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a 
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of 
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel 
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. 
 CVE-2019-12984 
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null 
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). 
 CVE-2019-13233 
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. 
 CVE-2019-13631 
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's 
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-13648 
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to 
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). 
 CVE-2019-14283 
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a 
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-14284 
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could 
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). 
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) 
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. 
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) 
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. 
 XSA-300 
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of 
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). 
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. 
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2.

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. 
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: 
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update 
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade

 This is known to break some proxies when used against security.debian.org. If that happens, people can switch their security APT source to use deb http://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian-security stable/updates main 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.9.</td>

CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.

CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

 CVE ID: CVE-2019-3846 CVE-2019-5489 CVE-2019-9500 CVE-2019-9503 CVE-2019-10126 CVE-2019-11477

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

<td>In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. 
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated. 
 To work around this issue, configure the BGP peering on a _new_ VLAN interface (for example, vlan4093) instead of the peer link sub-interface (peerlink.4094).

 Package : dbus 
 CVE ID : CVE-2019-12749 
 Debian Bug : 930375 
 Joe Vennix discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in dbus, an asynchronous inter-process communication system. The implementation of the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism was susceptible to a symbolic link attack. A local attacker could take advantage of this flaw to bypass authentication and connect to a DBusServer with elevated privileges. 
 The standard system and session dbus-daemons in their default configuration are not affected by this vulnerability. 
 The vulnerability was addressed by upgrading dbus to a new upstream version 1.10.28 which includes additional fixes. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.10.28-0+deb9u1. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

This is due to a race condition between ASIC and kernel programming that causes the kernel to incorrectly process the link state of a VXLAN interface.

 ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123

CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

 This problem might occur during or after network convergence events. For example, when {{bgpd}} needs to process a high number of updates and the CPU cannot keep up, {{bgpd}} is disconnected and {{agentx}} generates a core dump in {{snmpd}} due to a memory allocation problem.

<td>Under certain circumstances (when you reboot or restart the {{switchd}} service), a race condition might occur which causes a synchronization issue resulting in hardware misprogramming of the VXLAN tunnel endpoint interface (VTEP).

 ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123 
  
 Run the net {{show vrf vni}} command to show a mapping of the layer 3 VNI to layer 3 SVI for the VRF.

<td>The following vulnerabilities have been announced in bluez, the Linux Bluetooth protocol stack:
CVE-2019-8921: SDP infoleak; the vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking arbitrary heap data.
CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.

On a Cumulus Linux switch, the impact is limited to control plane and management plane traffic. Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.
To work around this issue, create a file called {{/etc/sysctl.d/ip.conf}} and add these settings:

 CVE ID: CVE-2018-20685 CVE-2019-6109 CVE-2019-6111 
 Debian Bug: 793412 919101 
 Harry Sintonen from F-Secure Corporation discovered multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSH, an implementation of the SSH protocol suite. All the vulnerabilities are in found in the scp client implementing the SCP protocol. 
 CVE-2018-20685 
 Due to improper directory name validation, the scp client allows servers tovmodify permissions of the target directory by using empty or dotvdirectory name. 
 CVE-2019-6109 
 Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, the object name can be used to manipulate the client output, for example to employ ANSI codes to hide additional files being transferred. 
 CVE-2019-6111 
 Due to scp client insufficient input validation in path names sent by server, a malicious server can do arbitrary file overwrites in target directory. If the recursive (-r) option is provided, the server can also manipulate subdirectories as well. 
 The check added in this version can lead to regression if the client and the server have differences in wildcard expansion rules. If the server is trusted for that purpose, the check can be disabled with a new -T option to the scp client. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 1:7.4p1-10+deb9u5. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

 Package: systemd 
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-16864 CVE-2018-16865 CVE-2018-16866 
 Debian Bug: 918841 918848 
 The Qualys Research Labs discovered multiple vulnerabilities in systemd-journald. Two memory corruption flaws, via attacker-controlled alloca()s (CVE-2018-16864, CVE-2018-16865) and an out-of-bounds read flaw leading to an information leak (CVE-2018-16866), could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 Further details in the Qualys Security Advisory at https://www.qualys.com/2019/01/09/system-down/system-down.txt 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 232-25+deb9u7. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.

 Cumulus Linux removes the net commands and adds the following line to FRR (using {{v6only remote-as}}), which causes BGP to flap. 
  
 neighbor swp29 interface v6only remote-as external 
  
 This issue does not occur if you add the {{peer-group}} command; for example:

 cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor external remote-as external 
 cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp29 interface v6only peer-group external

It was discovered that various procedures in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, do not properly restrict privileged calls, which could result in bypass of file system restrictions of the dSAFER sandbox.
We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time.

 CVE-2018-14526 
 wpa_supplicant and hostapd could be made to expose sensitive information if it received a crafted message. 
 It was discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled certain messages. An attacker could possibly use this to access sensitive information. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: 
 buntu 18.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 wpasupplicant 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 wpasupplicant 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 wpasupplicant 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

 To work around this issue: 
 # Manually define the MAC address for the SVI. 
 The MAC address allocated to the SVI is inherited by the bridge (by default). The bridge inherits the MAC address from a physical interface (swp*). This inheritance might result in a different SVI MAC address after a reboot (for example, a configuration change might result in the port being removed from the bridge). 
 For this example, the MAC address of SVI {{vlan123}} is statically configured as sw01 = MM:MM:MM:11:11:11 and sw02 = MM:MM:MM:22:22:22. 
 # Program a static entry on sw01 pointing to sw02 over the _peerlink_ bond in VLAN 123: 
  
 iface vlan123 
 post-up bridge fdb add MM:MM:MM:22:22:22 dev peerlink vlan 123 master static

An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

CVE ID : CVE-2019-14811 CVE-2019-14812 CVE-2019-14813 CVE-2019-14817
It was discovered that various procedures in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, do not properly restrict privileged calls, which could result in bypass of file system restrictions of the dSAFER sandbox.
We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

 CVE-2018-14526 
 wpa_supplicant and hostapd could be made to expose sensitive information if it received a crafted message. 
 It was discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled certain messages. An attacker could possibly use this to access sensitive information. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: 
 buntu 18.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 wpasupplicant 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 wpasupplicant 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 wpasupplicant 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

CVE-2019-8922: SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.
CVE-2021-41229: sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time.

 Cumulus Linux removes the net commands and adds the following line to FRR (using {{v6only remote-as}}), which causes BGP to flap.

 CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') - CVE-2018-5390 
 Linux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service. An attacker can induce a denial of service condition by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port. Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.

 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 
 Summary: Several security issues were fixed in NTP. 
 Software Description: ntp: Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs 
 Details: 
 Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain malformed mode 6 packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ntpd to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-7182) 
 Michael Macnair discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7183) 
 Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain zero-origin timestamps. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-7184)

<td>If you change the ASN configuration on a switch running EVPN then reload the FRR service (using {{sudo systemctl reload frr}} or via {{net commit}}), the programming of VXLAN forwarding entries breaks. 
 To avoid this issue when making this change, restart the FRR process (using {{sudo systemctl restart frr}}) instead. </td>

<td>On a Cumulus Linux switch, if a bridge has VXLAN interfaces, then the {{arp_accept}} and {{arp_ignore}} options do not work for any switch virtual interfaces (SVIs). 
 To work around this issue, disable ARP suppression on the VXLAN interfaces. For example, if the VXLAN is named vni100, disable ARP suppression on it with the following command: 
  
 cumulus@switch:~$ net add vxlan vni100 bridge arp-nd-suppress off 
 cumulus@switch:~$ net commit 
  
 This issue should be fixed in a future release of Cumulus Linux.</td>

<td>In a VXLAN centralized routing configuration, IPv6 hosts (auto-configured using SLAAC) might experience intermittent connectivity loss between VXLAN segments (inter-subnet routing) within the data center fabric (EVPN type-5 external routes are not affected). 
The NA message has the wrong flag set (the router flag is not set, which is incorrect behavior based on RFC 4861, Section 4.4). 
To work around this issue, configure {{bridge-arp-nd-suppress off}} under VNI interfaces for all VTEP devices.</td>
