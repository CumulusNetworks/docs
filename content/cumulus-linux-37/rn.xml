Eventually, the keepalive timer expires and the secondary switch becomes the primary, and brings the bonds and VNIs back up. However, if {{switchd}} does not successfully signal it is going down, (in the event of a crash), the primary switch continues to respond to keepalives, and the bonds and VNIs are down on both peers. </td>

<td>Several security vulnerabilities were found in ImageMagick, a suite of image manipulation programs. An attacker could cause denial of service and execution of arbitrary code when a crafted image file is processed.
CVE-2020-19667 Stack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump in ReadXPMImage in coders/xpm.c
CVE-2020-25665 The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read later on in the routine. This could cause impact to reliability.
CVE-2020-25674 WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger.
CVE-2020-27560 ImageMagick allows Division by Zero in OptimizeLayerFrames in MagickCore/layer.c, which may cause a denial of service.
CVE-2020-27750 A flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type unsigned char and math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27760 In GammaImage() of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the gamma value, it’s possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could lead to an impact to application availability.
CVE-2020-27763 A flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27765 A flaw was found in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27773 A flaw was found in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type unsigned char or division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-29599 ImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

<td>The following vulnerability has been announced that affects ntp:
CVE-2020-11868: ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows an off-path attacker to block unauthenticated synchronization via a server mode packet with a spoofed source IP address, because transmissions are rescheduled even when a packet lacks a valid origin timestamp.
This affects: ntp-4.2.8p12 (possibly earlier) and ntp-4.2.8p13
The fix for https://bugs.ntp.org/3445 introduced a bug whereby a system that is running ntp-4.2.8p12 or p13 that only has one unauthenticated time source can be attacked in a way that causes the victim's next poll to its source to be delayed, for as long as the attack is maintained.
http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3592 gives the following mitigations if it is not possible to upgrade to a version with the fix:
* Use authentication with symmetric peers.
* Have enough sources of time.  The default NTP configuration in Cumulus Linux has four time sources.

CVE-2020-19667 Stack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump in ReadXPMImage in coders/xpm.c
CVE-2020-25665 The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read later on in the routine. This could cause impact to reliability.
CVE-2020-25674 WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger.
CVE-2020-27560 ImageMagick allows Division by Zero in OptimizeLayerFrames in MagickCore/layer.c, which may cause a denial of service.
CVE-2020-27750 A flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type unsigned char and math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27760 In GammaImage() of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the gamma value, it’s possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could lead to an impact to application availability.
CVE-2020-27763 A flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
CVE-2020-27765 A flaw was found in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

CVE-2020-11868: ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows an off-path attacker to block unauthenticated synchronization via a server mode packet with a spoofed source IP address, because transmissions are rescheduled even when a packet lacks a valid origin timestamp.
This affects: ntp-4.2.8p12 (possibly earlier) and ntp-4.2.8p13
The fix for https://bugs.ntp.org/3445 introduced a bug whereby a system that is running ntp-4.2.8p12 or p13 that only has one unauthenticated time source can be attacked in a way that causes the victim's next poll to its source to be delayed, for as long as the attack is maintained.
http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3592 gives the following mitigations if it is not possible to upgrade to a version with the fix:
* Use authentication with symmetric peers.
* Have enough sources of time.  The default NTP configuration in Cumulus Linux has four time sources.

<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094):

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

The fix for https://bugs.ntp.org/3445 introduced a bug whereby a system that is running ntp-4.2.8p12 or p13 that only has one unauthenticated time source can be attacked in a way that causes the victim's next poll to its source to be delayed, for as long as the attack is maintained.
http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3592 gives the following mitigations if it is not possible to upgrade to a version with the fix:
* Use authentication with symmetric peers.
* Have enough sources of time.  The default NTP configuration in Cumulus Linux has four time sources.

{noformat}
cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

<td>On a Trident3 switch, IGMP packets are not policed by the police rule in the 00control ACL file. The packets are policed by the catchall policer in the 99control ACL file instead.

To work around this issue, let the CPU bound IGMP packet hit the following rule and change the policer rate to a desired value for IGMP packets: 
 {{-A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100}} 
Typically, the destination MAC address 01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx is used only for PIM/IGMP control and data stream packets. However, this workaround cannot handle data stream multicast packets that are not TCP/UDP; this is not typically done. </td>

<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094):

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

To workaround this issue, use IPv4 addresses under {{peerlink.4094}} and configure {{clagd}} to peer on IPv4 addresses.</td>

This affects: ntp-4.2.8p12 (possibly earlier) and ntp-4.2.8p13
The fix for https://bugs.ntp.org/3445 introduced a bug whereby a system that is running ntp-4.2.8p12 or p13 that only has one unauthenticated time source can be attacked in a way that causes the victim's next poll to its source to be delayed, for as long as the attack is maintained.
http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3592 gives the following mitigations if it is not possible to upgrade to a version with the fix:
* Use authentication with symmetric peers.
* Have enough sources of time.  The default NTP configuration in Cumulus Linux has four time sources.

<td>The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.

CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).

CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042
{{rsyslogd}}, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.
Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\
The default {{/etc/rsyslog.conf}} file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable {{$UDPServerRun}} or {{$InputTCPServerRun}}, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration.

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active.

* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting.

<td>On the Broadcom Trident 3 switch, VXLAN encapsulated packets are dropped on the ingress port (tagged layer 2 port) during transit forwarding (the local switch does not terminate the VXLAN tunnel). An example of where this two-layer VXLAN inside VXLAN encapsulation might occur:
- VXLAN tunnel (#1) between two servers (different racks) to provide layer 2 extension for containers or VM hosts.
- VXLAN tunnel (#2) between the TOR switch in rack 1 to the TOR switch located in the remote rack. 

To work around this issue, either:
- Configure the edge port (facing the servers) to be an access port (instead of a trunk/tagged port)
- Change the destination port from 4789 to something else (VXLAN tunnel terminated by the servers)</td>

<td>CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack) is a network vulnerability where an attacker can trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly with specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service. On a Cumulus Linux switch, the impact is limited to control plane and management plane traffic. Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.

CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. 
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors ([https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv]). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:
{noformat}
cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head
{noformat}
Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:
{noformat}

{noformat}
*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim.

 https://github.com/numirias/security/blob/master/doc/2019-06-04_ace-vim-neovim.md 
 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the {{vimrc}} file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. 
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: 
 :set modeline? 
 If vim returns {{nomodeline}}, you are _not_ vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your {{vimrc}} file: 
 {noformat} 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline

* If eth0 is configured in the management VRF, power cycle the switch; the eth0 configuration fails and reverts back to the default (auto-negotiation/1000). 
* If eth0 is configured in the default VRF and you power cycle after the crash, {{igb}} continues to crash on boot up (before getting to login prompt); power-cycle the switch, select the Advanced option in GRUB to boot to recovery mode, then modify the {{/etc/network/interfaces}} file.</td>

<td>In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the {{clagd}} {{init-delay}} timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result.

<td>When you use NCLU to configure a route map, the parser allows for glob matching of interfaces for a _match interface_ condition when there can only be a single interface matched. The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. 
 For example, this command is incorrect: 
 {noformat} 
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10 
 {noformat} 
 These commands are correct:

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.

 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. 
 CVE-2015-8553 
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. 
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.

 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN 
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2018-5995 
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to 
 exploit other vulnerabilities. 
 CVE-2018-20836 
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead 
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. 
 CVE-2019-1125 
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel 
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could 
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. 
 CVE-2019-1999 
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

 CVE-2019-3882 
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of 
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). 
 CVE-2019-3900 
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious 
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. 
 CVE-2019-10207 
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access 
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). 
 CVE-2019-10638 
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, &quot;jhash&quot;. This could enable 
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The &quot;siphash&quot; function is 
 now used instead. 
 CVE-2019-10639 
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel 
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. 
 CVE-2019-12817 
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a 
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of 
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel 
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. 
 CVE-2019-12984 
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null 
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). 
 CVE-2019-13233 
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. 
 CVE-2019-13631 
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's 
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-13648 
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to 
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). 
 CVE-2019-14283 
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a 
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-14284 
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could 
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). 
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) 
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. 
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) 
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. 
 XSA-300 
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of 
 &quot;foreign / grant map&quot; memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3.

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. 
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: 
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update 
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade

 Package: perl 
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-18311 CVE-2018-18312 CVE-2018-18313 CVE-2018-18314 
 Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the implementation of the Perl programming language. 
 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: 
 CVE-2018-18311 
 Jayakrishna Menon and Christophe Hauser discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in Perl_my_setenv leading to a 
 heap-basedbuffer overflow with attacker-controlled input. 
 CVE-2018-18312 
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow write during 
 compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. 
 CVE-2018-18313 
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow read during compilation which leads to information leak. 
 CVE-2018-18314 
 Jakub Wilk discovered that a specially crafted regular expression could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 5.24.1-3+deb9u5. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.

 Package: ghostscript 
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-19409 CVE-2018-19475 CVE-2018-19476 CVE-2018-19477 
 Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may 
 result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed 
 (despite the -dSAFER sandbox being enabled). 
 This update rebases ghostscript for stretch to the upstream version 9.26 which includes additional changes. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 9.26~dfsg-0+deb9u1. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

 CVE ID: CVE-2019-3846 CVE-2019-5489 CVE-2019-9500 CVE-2019-9503 CVE-2019-10126 CVE-2019-11477

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE ID: CVE-2019-13377 CVE-2019-16275
Two vulnerabilities were found in the WPA protocol implementation found in wpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).
CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

 CVE ID: CVE-2019-3846 CVE-2019-5489 CVE-2019-9500 CVE-2019-9503 CVE-2019-10126 CVE-2019-11477

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. 
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated.

 Package : dbus 
 CVE ID : CVE-2019-12749 
 Debian Bug : 930375 
 Joe Vennix discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in dbus, an asynchronous inter-process communication system. The implementation of the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism was susceptible to a symbolic link attack. A local attacker could take advantage of this flaw to bypass authentication and connect to a DBusServer with elevated privileges. 
 The standard system and session dbus-daemons in their default configuration are not affected by this vulnerability. 
 The vulnerability was addressed by upgrading dbus to a new upstream version 1.10.28 which includes additional fixes. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.10.28-0+deb9u1. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

 Package : systemd 
 CVE ID : CVE-2019-3842 
 Jann Horn discovered that the PAM module in systemd insecurely uses the environment and lacks seat verification permitting spoofing an active session to PolicyKit. A remote attacker with SSH access can take advantage of this issue to gain PolicyKit privileges that are normally only granted to clients in an active session on the local console. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 232-25+deb9u11. 
 This update includes updates previously scheduled to be released in the stretch 9.9 point release. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.

<td>In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. 
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated.

 Debian Bug: 928989 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or 
 information leaks. 
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of 
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-5489 
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh 
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access 
 the same memory-mapped file. 
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), 
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. 
 CVE-2019-11477 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely 
 triggerable kernel panic. 
 CVE-2019-11478 
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP 
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. 
 CVE-2019-11479 
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, 
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. 
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the 
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. 
 CVE-2019-11486 
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to 
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. 
 CVE-2019-11599 
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local 
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. 
 CVE-2019-11815 
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially 
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where 
 it is explicitly loaded. 
 CVE-2019-11833 
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. 
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be 
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. 
 CVE-2019-11884 
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. 
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE ID:  CVE-2019-1547 CVE-2019-1549 CVE-2019-1563
Three security issues were discovered in OpenSSL: A timing attack against

CVE ID: CVE-2019-13377 CVE-2019-16275
Two vulnerabilities were found in the WPA protocol implementation found in wpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).
CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

 CVE ID: CVE-2018-20685 CVE-2019-6109 CVE-2019-6111 
 Debian Bug: 793412 919101 
 Harry Sintonen from F-Secure Corporation discovered multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSH, an implementation of the SSH protocol suite. All the vulnerabilities are in found in the scp client implementing the SCP protocol. 
 CVE-2018-20685 
 Due to improper directory name validation, the scp client allows servers tovmodify permissions of the target directory by using empty or dotvdirectory name. 
 CVE-2019-6109 
 Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, the object name can be used to manipulate the client output, for example to employ ANSI codes to hide additional files being transferred. 
 CVE-2019-6111 
 Due to scp client insufficient input validation in path names sent by server, a malicious server can do arbitrary file overwrites in target directory. If the recursive (-r) option is provided, the server can also manipulate subdirectories as well. 
 The check added in this version can lead to regression if the client and the server have differences in wildcard expansion rules. If the server is trusted for that purpose, the check can be disabled with a new -T option to the scp client. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 1:7.4p1-10+deb9u5. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

A few of the MMU memories on Broadcom switches are grouped together with single parity control. During SER correction when a parity error occurs on one of those groups, other memory in that group might also report a SER error. This occurs when the memory is accessed either by a packet hit or through a schan operation. This issue can cause SER errors in other memory and cause traffic mis-forwarding or a packet drop.</td>

<td>Package: openssl
CVE ID:  CVE-2019-1547 CVE-2019-1549 CVE-2019-1563
Three security issues were discovered in OpenSSL: A timing attack against
ECDSA, a padding oracle in PKCS7_dataDecode() and CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey()
and it was discovered that a feature of the random number generator (RNG)
intended to protect against shared RNG state between parent and child
processes in the event of a fork() syscall was not used by default.
Fixed version: 1.1.1d-0+deb10u1

Two vulnerabilities were found in the WPA protocol implementation found in wpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).
CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. 
 For example, this command is incorrect: 
 {noformat} 
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10 
 {noformat} 
 These commands are correct:

 CVE-2018-14526 
 wpa_supplicant and hostapd could be made to expose sensitive information if it received a crafted message. 
 It was discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled certain messages. An attacker could possibly use this to access sensitive information. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: 
 buntu 18.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 wpasupplicant 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 wpasupplicant 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 wpasupplicant 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

 # Manually define the MAC address for the SVI. 
 The MAC address allocated to the SVI is inherited by the bridge (by default). The bridge inherits the MAC address from a physical interface (swp*). This inheritance might result in a different SVI MAC address after a reboot (for example, a configuration change might result in the port being removed from the bridge). 
 For this example, the MAC address of SVI {{vlan123}} is statically configured as sw01 = MM:MM:MM:11:11:11 and sw02 = MM:MM:MM:22:22:22. 
 # Program a static entry on sw01 pointing to sw02 over the _peerlink_ bond in VLAN 123:

CVE-2019-13377
A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the password.
CVE-2019-16275
Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.

 CVE-2018-14526 
 wpa_supplicant and hostapd could be made to expose sensitive information if it received a crafted message. 
 It was discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled certain messages. An attacker could possibly use this to access sensitive information. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: 
 buntu 18.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 wpasupplicant 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 wpasupplicant 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 wpasupplicant 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

 wpa_supplicant and hostapd could be made to expose sensitive information if it received a crafted message. 
 It was discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled certain messages. An attacker could possibly use this to access sensitive information. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: 
 buntu 18.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 wpasupplicant 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:

 wpasupplicant 2.4-0ubuntu6.3 
 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 
 hostapd 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 wpasupplicant 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 
 After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

 CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') - CVE-2018-5390 
 Linux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service. An attacker can induce a denial of service condition by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port. Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.

 Package: ruby2.3 
 CVE ID: CVE-2017-17405 CVE-2017-17742 CVE-2017-17790 CVE-2018-6914 CVE-2018-8777 CVE-2018-8778 CVE-2018-8779 CVE-2018-8780 CVE-2018-1000073 CVE-2018-1000074 CVE-2018-1000075 CVE-2018-1000076 CVE-2018-1000077 CVE-2018-1000078 CVE-2018-1000079 
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the Ruby language, which may result in incorrect processing of HTTP/FTP, directory traversal, command injection, unintended socket creation or information disclosure. 
 This update also fixes several issues in RubyGems which could allow an attacker to use specially crafted gem files to mount cross-site scripting attacks, cause denial of service through an infinite loop, write arbitrary files, or run malicious code. 
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 2.3.3-1+deb9u3. 
 We recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.3 packages. 
 Note: CVE-2018-1000073 and CVE-2018-1000074 are awaiting re-analysis.

 [USN-3707-1] NTP vulnerabilities 
 Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3707-1 
 July 09, 2018 
 ntp vulnerabilities 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives: 
 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 
 Ubuntu 17.10 
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 
 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 
 Summary: Several security issues were fixed in NTP. 
 Software Description: ntp: Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs 
 Details: 
 Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain malformed mode 6 packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ntpd to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-7182) 
 Michael Macnair discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7183) 
 Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain zero-origin timestamps. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-7184) 
 Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain zero-origin timestamps. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-7185) 
 Update instructions: The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: 
 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS: ntp 1:4.2.8p10+dfsg-5ubuntu7.1 
 Ubuntu 17.10: ntp 1:4.2.8p10+dfsg-5ubuntu3.3 
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: ntp 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3ubuntu5.9 
 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: ntp 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.13 
 In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

 {noformat} 
 cumulus@switch:~$ net add vxlan vni100 bridge arp-nd-suppress off 
 cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
