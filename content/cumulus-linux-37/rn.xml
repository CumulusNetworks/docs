<td><p>CVE-2020-11868: ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows an off-path attacker to block unauthenticated synchronization via a server mode packet with a spoofed source IP address, because transmissions are rescheduled even when a packet lacks a valid origin timestamp.<br/>
This affects: ntp-4.2.8p12 (possibly earlier) and ntp-4.2.8p13<br/>
The fix for <a href="https://bugs.ntp.org/3445" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://bugs.ntp.org/3445</a> introduced a bug whereby a system that is running ntp-4.2.8p12 or p13 that only has one unauthenticated time source can be attacked in a way that causes the victim's next poll to its source to be delayed, for as long as the attack is maintained.<br/>
<a href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3592" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3592</a> gives the following mitigations if it is not possible to upgrade to a version with the fix:</p>

<td><p>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and lldpd is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (<a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv</a>). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>
To check if lldpd is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:</p>

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head


<p>Alternatively, check for messages in the /var/log/syslog directory similar to:</p>

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%

<p><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for lldpd to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the bridge-vids list to include the VLANs being used).</li>
	<li>Stop the lldpd service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the lldpd service (runtime setting), run the sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service command. To disable the lldpd service upon boot, run sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service.</li>

CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 <br/>
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>
See <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html</a> for more details. <br/>
To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install updated CPU microcode. Contact your hardware ndor for microcode uppdates.<br/>
In addition, this update includes a fix for a regression causing deadlocks inside the loopback driver. <br/>

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting.

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>

This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (<a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv</a>). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>
To check if lldpd is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:</p>

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head


<p>Alternatively, check for messages in the /var/log/syslog directory similar to:</p>

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%

<p><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for lldpd to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the bridge-vids list to include the VLANs being used).</li>
	<li>Stop the lldpd service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the lldpd service (runtime setting), run the sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service command. To disable the lldpd service upon boot, run sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service.</li>

CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 <br/>
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>
See <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html</a> for more details. <br/>
To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install updated CPU microcode. Contact your hardware ndor for microcode uppdates.<br/>
In addition, this update includes a fix for a regression causing deadlocks inside the loopback driver. <br/>

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd.<br/>
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br/>
In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: </p>

 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$

 Package: vim and neovim <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2019-12735 <br/>
 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 <br/>
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: </p>
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
<p> modeline is enabled by default. <br/>
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in .vimrc that set modelines or modeline.</p></td>

CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>

Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.<br/>

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd.<br/>

 Package: vim and neovim <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2019-12735 <br/>
 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 <br/>
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: </p>
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
<p> modeline is enabled by default. <br/>
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in .vimrc that set modelines or modeline.</p></td>

<td><p>The following CVEs were announced in Debian Security Advisory DSA-444-1, DSA-4447-1 and affect the linux kernel and microcode. <br/>
Package: linux <br/>
CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 <br/>
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>
See <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html</a> for more details. <br/>
To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install updated CPU microcode. Contact your hardware ndor for microcode uppdates.<br/>
In addition, this update includes a fix for a regression causing deadlocks inside the loopback driver. <br/>

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting.

This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>

<td><p>In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the clagd init-delay timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.<br/>
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd.<br/>
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br/>
In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: </p>

 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ 

route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 
match as-path MY_ASN 
set as-path prepend 4200000101 
route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20

 CVE ID: CVE-2019-12735 <br/>
 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 <br/>
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: </p>
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
<p> modeline is enabled by default. <br/>
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in .vimrc that set modelines or modeline.</p></td>

<td><p>The following CVEs were announced in Debian Security Advisory DSA-444-1, DSA-4447-1 and affect the linux kernel and microcode. <br/>
Package: linux <br/>
CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 <br/>
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>
See <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html</a> for more details. <br/>
To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install updated CPU microcode. Contact your hardware ndor for microcode uppdates.<br/>
In addition, this update includes a fix for a regression causing deadlocks inside the loopback driver. <br/>

 CVE ID: CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/>

 Debian Bug: 928989 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or <br/>
 information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 <br/>
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of <br/>
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-5489 <br/>
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh <br/>
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access <br/>
 the same memory-mapped file. <br/>
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 <br/>
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), <br/>
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11477 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely <br/>
 triggerable kernel panic. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11478 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP <br/>
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11479 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, <br/>
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. <br/>
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the <br/>
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11486 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to <br/>
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11599 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local <br/>
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11815 <br/>
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially <br/>
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/>
 it is explicitly loaded. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11833 <br/>
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/>
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/>
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11884 <br/>
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/>
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

<p>CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/>

CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042<br/>
rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>
Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>
The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration.</p></td>

CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>

 CVE ID: CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/>

 Debian Bug: 928989 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or <br/>
 information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 <br/>
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of <br/>
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-5489 <br/>
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh <br/>
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access <br/>
 the same memory-mapped file. <br/>
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 <br/>
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), <br/>
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11477 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely <br/>
 triggerable kernel panic. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11478 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP <br/>
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11479 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, <br/>
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. <br/>
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the <br/>
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11486 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to <br/>
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11599 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local <br/>
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11815 <br/>
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially <br/>
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/>
 it is explicitly loaded. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11833 <br/>
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/>
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/>
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11884 <br/>
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/>
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>
CVE-2019-20054: In the Linux kernel before 5.0.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table() in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c, related to put_links, aka CID-23da9588037e.</p></td>

 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/>

 Debian Bug: 928989 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or <br/>
 information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 <br/>
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of <br/>
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-5489 <br/>
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh <br/>
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access <br/>
 the same memory-mapped file. <br/>
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 <br/>
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), <br/>
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11477 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely <br/>
 triggerable kernel panic. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11478 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP <br/>
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11479 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, <br/>
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. <br/>
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the <br/>
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11486 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to <br/>
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11599 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local <br/>
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11815 <br/>
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially <br/>
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/>

 CVE-2019-11833 <br/>
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/>
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/>
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11884 <br/>
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/>
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: </p>
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
<p> modeline is enabled by default. <br/>
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in .vimrc that set modelines or modeline.</p></td>

CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 <br/>
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>

To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install updated CPU microcode. Contact your hardware ndor for microcode uppdates.<br/>
In addition, this update includes a fix for a regression causing deadlocks inside the loopback driver. <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

 Package: ghostscript <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-19409 CVE-2018-19475 CVE-2018-19476 CVE-2018-19477 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may <br/>
 result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed <br/>

<td><p>In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. <br/>
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated. <br/>
 To work around this issue, configure the BGP peering on a <em>new</em> VLAN interface (for example, vlan4093) instead of the peer link sub-interface (peerlink.4094). </p>

 Package : dbus <br/>
 CVE ID : CVE-2019-12749 <br/>
 Debian Bug : 930375 <br/>
 Joe Vennix discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in dbus, an asynchronous inter-process communication system. The implementation of the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism was susceptible to a symbolic link attack. A local attacker could take advantage of this flaw to bypass authentication and connect to a DBusServer with elevated privileges. <br/>
 The standard system and session dbus-daemons in their default configuration are not affected by this vulnerability. <br/>
 The vulnerability was addressed by upgrading dbus to a new upstream version 1.10.28 which includes additional fixes. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.10.28-0+deb9u1. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages. <br/>

This is due to a race condition between ASIC and kernel programming that causes the kernel to incorrectly process the link state of a VXLAN interface. <br/>

However, if you restart switchd without rebooting the system, switchd synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the /etc/cumulus/ports.conf file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

<p>CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/>

rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>
Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>
The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration.</p></td>

CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>

 CVE ID: CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/>

 Debian Bug: 928989 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or <br/>
 information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126 <br/>
 huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of <br/>
 service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-5489 <br/>
 Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh <br/>
 discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to obtain sensitive information from other processes that access <br/>
 the same memory-mapped file. <br/>
 CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503 <br/>
 Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), <br/>
 which a attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11477 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely <br/>
 triggerable kernel panic. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11478 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP <br/>
 retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource usage. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11479 <br/>
 Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, <br/>
 each of which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. <br/>
 This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the <br/>
 formerly hard-coded value of 48. We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know that your network requires a lower value. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11486 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to <br/>
 cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been disabled. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11599 <br/>
 Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local <br/>
 user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11815 <br/>
 It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially <br/>
 privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where <br/>
 it is explicitly loaded. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11833 <br/>
 It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. <br/>
 A local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be <br/>
 able to use this to obtain sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-11884 <br/>
 It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. <br/>
 A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: </p>
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
<p> modeline is enabled by default. <br/>

CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 <br/>
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>

This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

When you change the port speed in the /etc/cumulus/ports.conf file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

 Package: xen <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-7540 CVE-2018-7541 CVE-2018-7542 <br/>
 Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor: <br/>
 CVE-2018-7540 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered that missing checks in page table freeing may result in denial of service. <br/>
 CVE-2018-7541 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that incorrect error handling in grant table checks may result in guest-to-host <br/>
 denial of service and potentially privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-7542 <br/>
 Ian Jackson discovered that insufficient handling of x86 PVH guests without local APICs may result in <br/>

 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: </p>
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
<p> modeline is enabled by default. <br/>
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in .vimrc that set modelines or modeline.</p></td>

Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>

 Debian Bug: 923611 <br/>
 It was discovered that Wireshark, a network traffic analyzer, contained several vulnerabilities in the dissectors for 6LoWPAN, P_MUL, RTSE, ISAKMP, TCAP, ASN.1 BER and RPCAP, which could result in denial of service. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.7-1~deb9u1. <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

 Package: ghostscript <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-19409 CVE-2018-19475 CVE-2018-19476 CVE-2018-19477 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may <br/>
 result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed <br/>
 (despite the -dSAFER sandbox being enabled). <br/>
 This update rebases ghostscript for stretch to the upstream version 9.26 which includes additional changes. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 9.26~dfsg-0+deb9u1. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages. <br/>

However, if you restart switchd without rebooting the system, switchd synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the /etc/cumulus/ports.conf file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

 Package: xen <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-7540 CVE-2018-7541 CVE-2018-7542 <br/>
 Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor: <br/>
 CVE-2018-7540 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered that missing checks in page table freeing may result in denial of service. <br/>
 CVE-2018-7541 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that incorrect error handling in grant table checks may result in guest-to-host <br/>
 denial of service and potentially privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-7542 <br/>
 Ian Jackson discovered that insufficient handling of x86 PVH guests without local APICs may result in <br/>
 guest-to-host denial of service. <br/>

 CVE ID: CVE-2018-20685 CVE-2019-6109 CVE-2019-6111 <br/>
 Debian Bug: 793412 919101 <br/>
 Harry Sintonen from F-Secure Corporation discovered multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSH, an implementation of the SSH protocol suite. All the vulnerabilities are in found in the scp client implementing the SCP protocol. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20685 <br/>
 Due to improper directory name validation, the scp client allows servers tovmodify permissions of the target directory by using empty or dotvdirectory name. <br/>
 CVE-2019-6109 <br/>
 Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, the object name can be used to manipulate the client output, for example to employ ANSI codes to hide additional files being transferred. <br/>
 CVE-2019-6111 <br/>
 Due to scp client insufficient input validation in path names sent by server, a malicious server can do arbitrary file overwrites in target directory. If the recursive (-r) option is provided, the server can also manipulate subdirectories as well. <br/>
 The check added in this version can lead to regression if the client and the server have differences in wildcard expansion rules. If the server is trusted for that purpose, the check can be disabled with a new -T option to the scp client. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 1:7.4p1-10+deb9u5. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages. <br/>

 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed soon. <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

<td><p>At a high CPU transmit traffic rate (for example, if there is unexpected CPU generated flooding or replication in software), when the ASIC packet driver cannot keep up with the transmit rate because there are no free DMA buffers, it can back pressure by suspending the switch port transmit queues.

When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a switchd restart.</p></td>

When you change the port speed in the /etc/cumulus/ports.conf file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

 Debian Bug: 918841 918848 <br/>
 The Qualys Research Labs discovered multiple vulnerabilities in systemd-journald. Two memory corruption flaws, via attacker-controlled alloca()s (CVE-2018-16864, CVE-2018-16865) and an out-of-bounds read flaw leading to an information leak (CVE-2018-16866), could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. <br/>

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>

 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>

 Package : wget <br/>
 CVE ID : CVE-2019-5953 <br/>
 Debian Bug : 926389 <br/>
 Kusano Kazuhiko discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) in wget, a network utility to retrieve files from the web, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service when recursively downloading from an untrusted server. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.18-5+deb9u3. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your wget packages. <br/>
 For the detailed security status of wget, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

 heap-basedbuffer overflow with attacker-controlled input. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18312 <br/>
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow write during <br/>
 compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18313 <br/>
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow read during compilation which leads to information leak. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18314 <br/>

To work around this issue, let the CPU bound IGMP packet hit the following rule and change the policer rate to a desired value for IGMP packets: <br/>
 -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p ipv4 -d 01:00:5e:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:80:00:00 -j police --set-mode pkt --set-rate 100 --set-burst 100 <br/>
Typically, the destination MAC address 01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx is used only for PIM/IGMP control and data stream packets. However, this workaround cannot handle data stream multicast packets that are not TCP/UDP; this is not typically done. </p></td>

When you change the port speed in the /etc/cumulus/ports.conf file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

<p>CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/>

rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>

 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>

 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>

 Package : wget <br/>
 CVE ID : CVE-2019-5953 <br/>
 Debian Bug : 926389 <br/>
 Kusano Kazuhiko discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) in wget, a network utility to retrieve files from the web, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service when recursively downloading from an untrusted server. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.18-5+deb9u3. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your wget packages. <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

 Package: perl <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-18311 CVE-2018-18312 CVE-2018-18313 CVE-2018-18314 <br/>
 Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the implementation of the Perl programming language. <br/>
 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: <br/>
 CVE-2018-18311 <br/>
 Jayakrishna Menon and Christophe Hauser discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in Perl_my_setenv leading to a <br/>
 heap-basedbuffer overflow with attacker-controlled input. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18312 <br/>
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow write during <br/>
 compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18313 <br/>
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow read during compilation which leads to information leak. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18314 <br/>
 Jakub Wilk discovered that a specially crafted regular expression could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 5.24.1-3+deb9u5. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages. <br/>

 Package: ghostscript <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-19409 CVE-2018-19475 CVE-2018-19476 CVE-2018-19477 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may <br/>
 result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed <br/>
 (despite the -dSAFER sandbox being enabled). <br/>
 This update rebases ghostscript for stretch to the upstream version 9.26 which includes additional changes. <br/>

 Package : ruby2.3 <br/>
 CVE ID : CVE-2018-16395 CVE-2018-16396 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the Ruby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: <br/>
 CVE-2018-16395 <br/>
 Tyler Eckstein reported that the equality check of OpenSSL::X509::Name could return true for non-equal objects. If a malicious X.509 certificate is passed to compare with an existing certificate, there is a possibility to be judged incorrectly that they are equal. <br/>
 CVE-2018-16396 <br/>
 Chris Seaton discovered that tainted flags are not propagated in Array#pack and String#unpack with some directives. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 2.3.3-1+deb9u4. <br/>

 To work around this issue: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Manually define the MAC address for the SVI.<br/>
 The MAC address allocated to the SVI is inherited by the bridge (by default). The bridge inherits the MAC address from a physical interface (swp*). This inheritance might result in a different SVI MAC address after a reboot (for example, a configuration change might result in the port being removed from the bridge). <br/>
 For this example, the MAC address of SVI vlan123 is statically configured as sw01 = MM:MM:MM:11:11:11 and sw02 = MM:MM:MM:22:22:22. </li>
	<li>Program a static entry on sw01 pointing to sw02 over the <em>peerlink</em> bond in VLAN 123:
 
 
 iface vlan123 
 post-up bridge fdb add MM:MM:MM:22:22:22 dev peerlink vlan 123 master static 
 
 </li>
	<li>Configure a static MAC address on sw02 pointing to the SVI owned by sw01 over the <em>peerlink</em> bond in VLAN 123:
 
 
 iface vlan123 
 post-up bridge fdb add MM:MM:MM:11:11:11 dev peerlink vlan 123 master static

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>

 Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks. <br/>
 CVE-2015-8553 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host. <br/>
 The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN <br/>
 capability (in any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-5995 <br/>
 ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to <br/>
 exploit other vulnerabilities. <br/>
 CVE-2018-20836 <br/>
 chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead <br/>
 to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1999 <br/>
 A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. If this driver is loaded, a local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-1125 <br/>
 It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel <br/>
 from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could <br/>
 allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using memory barriers to <br/>
 limit speculative execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS. <br/>
 CVE-2019-3882 <br/>
 It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership of <br/>
 a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). <br/>
 CVE-2019-3900 <br/>
 It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious <br/>
 guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service (unbounded CPU usage) on the host. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10207 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access <br/>
 to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for denial-of-service (BU G/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-10638 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash". This could enable <br/>
 tracking individual computers as they communicate with different remote servers and from different networks. The "siphash" function is <br/>
 now used instead. <br/>
 CVE-2019-10639 <br/>
 Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel <br/>
 virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs, although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12817 <br/>
 It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a <br/>
 process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB. This could lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of <br/>
 memory between user processes. A local user could use this for privilege escalation. Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom kernel <br/>
 with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected. <br/>
 CVE-2019-12984 <br/>
 It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading to a null <br/>
 pointer dereference. A local user on a system with an NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-13233 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture, in use of the LDT. This could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13631 <br/>
 It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's <br/>
 descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2019-13648 <br/>
 Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to <br/>
 restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 CVE-2019-14283 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a <br/>
 disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information. <br/>
 CVE-2019-14284 <br/>
 The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could <br/>
 use this for denial-of-service (oops). <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. <br/>
 (CVE ID not yet assigned) <br/>
 The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security vulnerabilities. <br/>
 XSA-300 <br/>
 Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of <br/>
 "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume, leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests). <br/>
 For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2. <br/>

CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 <br/>
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). <br/>
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. <br/>

To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install updated CPU microcode. Contact your hardware ndor for microcode uppdates.<br/>
In addition, this update includes a fix for a regression causing deadlocks inside the loopback driver. <br/>

 Max Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager. <br/>
 The code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly sanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject malicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized as a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root privileges on the target machine. Since the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is recommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this upgrade only, using: <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update <br/>
 apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade <br/>

 Package: perl <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-18311 CVE-2018-18312 CVE-2018-18313 CVE-2018-18314 <br/>
 Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the implementation of the Perl programming language. <br/>
 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: <br/>
 CVE-2018-18311 <br/>
 Jayakrishna Menon and Christophe Hauser discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in Perl_my_setenv leading to a <br/>
 heap-basedbuffer overflow with attacker-controlled input. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18312 <br/>
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow write during <br/>
 compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18313 <br/>
 Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could cause a heap-based buffer overflow read during compilation which leads to information leak. <br/>
 CVE-2018-18314 <br/>
 Jakub Wilk discovered that a specially crafted regular expression could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 5.24.1-3+deb9u5. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages. <br/>

 Package: ghostscript <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-19409 CVE-2018-19475 CVE-2018-19476 CVE-2018-19477 <br/>
 Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may <br/>
 result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed <br/>
 (despite the -dSAFER sandbox being enabled). <br/>
 This update rebases ghostscript for stretch to the upstream version 9.26 which includes additional changes. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 9.26~dfsg-0+deb9u1. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages. <br/>

 CVE-2018-14526 <br/>
 wpa_supplicant and hostapd could be made to expose sensitive information if it received a crafted message. <br/>
 It was discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled certain messages. An attacker could possibly use this to access sensitive information. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: <br/>
 buntu 18.04 LTS: <br/>
 hostapd 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 <br/>
 wpasupplicant 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.1 <br/>
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: <br/>

 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: <br/>
 hostapd 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 <br/>
 wpasupplicant 2.1-0ubuntu1.6 <br/>
 After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes. <br/>

 The MAC address allocated to the SVI is inherited by the bridge (by default). The bridge inherits the MAC address from a physical interface (swp*).

CVE-2018-6594: lib/Crypto/PublicKey/ElGamal.py in PyCrypto through 2.6.1 generates weak ElGamal key parameters, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack).

However, if you restart switchd without rebooting the system, switchd synchronizes the speed from the kernel and uses it to program the ASIC. When you change the port speed in the /etc/cumulus/ports.conf file to ether a higher or lower speed (for example from 100G to 40G or from 40G to 100G) and the attached cable can support both speeds, the pre-existing speed is synchronized from the kernel.

 Package: xen <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2018-7540 CVE-2018-7541 CVE-2018-7542 <br/>
 Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor: <br/>
 CVE-2018-7540 <br/>
 Jann Horn discovered that missing checks in page table freeing may result in denial of service. <br/>
 CVE-2018-7541 <br/>
 Jan Beulich discovered that incorrect error handling in grant table checks may result in guest-to-host <br/>
 denial of service and potentially privilege escalation. <br/>
 CVE-2018-7542 <br/>
 Ian Jackson discovered that insufficient handling of x86 PVH guests without local APICs may result in <br/>
 guest-to-host denial of service. <br/>
 For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version <br/>
 4.8.3+comet2+shim4.10.0+comet3-1+deb9u5. <br/>
 We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages. <br/>
