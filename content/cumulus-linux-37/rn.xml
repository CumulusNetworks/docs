<td>Traffic flows fail because the remote VTEP IP address is missing in the layer 3 neighbor table in hardware on the switch.  This happens when there is a neighbor entry for the same /32 that we have also received a type-5 route for.  When the route is learned after the neighbor entry there is a timing condition that can be hit that will cause the neighbor entry to get removed from hardware when the route is installed in hardware.

This condition has been seen when customers re-use the VTEP IP on an interface inside of a vrf.  The neigh entry for the TEP IP is installed when a symmetric route is learned via that VTEP.  The Type-5 route for the TEP IP is learned in the VRF if the customer has redistributed it or advertised it within BGP in the VRF.</td>

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

To work around this issue, configure Cumulus Linux to boot with the {{ntel_iommu=off}} kernel command option:

1. Open the {{/etc/default/grub}} file with a text editor.
2. Edit the {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}} variable by adding the string {{intel_iommu=off}} at the end.  For example: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=cel_e1031 console=ttyS1,115200n8 intel_iommu=off"
3. Run the {{update-grub}} command.
4. Reboot the switch.</td>

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

<td>When you configure BGP {{aggregate-address summary-only}} and any component route within the summary updates, all component routes within the summary update in the RIB on the device advertising the summary. This condition might result in increased CPU usage.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast
   aggregate-address 10.10.0.0/16 summary-only
   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0
   !
   address-family ipv4 unicast
   redistribute connected route-map DENY-COMPONENTS
   redistribute static
    exit-address-family
   ip prefix-list NO-COMPONENTS seq 5 permit 10.10.0.0/16 ge 17
   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS deny 10
    match ip address prefix-list NO-COMPONENTS
   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS permit 20


This example assumes no other static routes are present. Otherwise, you might need to configure additional route maps to limit the static routes being redistributed. </td>

<td>When a VTEP is rebooted, MAC address entries might become out of sync between the kernel fdb table and the EVPN MAC VNI table on remote VTEPs. The impacted MAC entries will be installed against the rebooted VTEP IP in the kernel fdb and the correct VTEP IP will be present in the EVPN MAC VNI table.

1. Clear all corrupted mac entries in the kernel FDB with the {{ bridge fdb del &lt;address&gt; dev &lt;interface&gt; [dst|via] &lt;interface|IP&gt; &lt;flags&gt; }} command
2. Add {{"vxlan-learning": "off"}} under {{/etc/network/ifupdown2/policy.d/vxlan.json}}.

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>Received EVPN type-5 and type-2 MACIP routes are not installed in the kernel (and hardware) routing tables for the associated VRF, which causes traffic to be blackholed. The failure to install the default route causes complete reachability failure for the particular tenant on the affected racks. The routes that are not installed are seen as "inactive" in the routing subsystem (FRR) VRF routing table. This problem is rare and can occur only in EVPN configurations that have user-configured route targets (RTs) for tenant VRFs, and only following a restart of FRR.
To work around this issue, either restart the FRR service on the affected switch with the {{sudo systemctl restart frr.service}} command or bounce the layer 3 SVI for the affected VRF; for example:

ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>

Before:

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast
   aggregate-address 10.10.0.0/16 summary-only
   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0

   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS permit 20

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094):

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA.

As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors ([https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv]). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors ([https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv]). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

<td>When you use NCLU to configure a route map, the parser allows for glob matching of interfaces for a _match interface_ condition when there can only be a single interface matched. The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. 
 For example, this command is incorrect: 
  
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active.

You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

<td>In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the {{clagd}} {{init-delay}} timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result.

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the {{clagd}} {{init-delay}} timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. 
In the {{/etc/frr/frr.conf}} file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: 
 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ 

route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 
match as-path MY_ASN 
set as-path prepend 4200000101

<td>In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. 
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated. 
 To work around this issue, configure the BGP peering on a _new_ VLAN interface (for example, vlan4093) instead of the peer link sub-interface (peerlink.4094).

<td>In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. 
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated.

To work around this issue: 
* If eth0 is configured in the management VRF, power cycle the switch; the eth0 configuration fails and reverts back to the default (auto-negotiation/1000). 
* If eth0 is configured in the default VRF and you power cycle after the crash, {{igb}} continues to crash on boot up (before getting to login prompt); power-cycle the switch, select the Advanced option in GRUB to boot to recovery mode, then modify the {{/etc/network/interfaces}} file.</td>

<td>When you use NCLU to configure a route map, the parser allows for glob matching of interfaces for a _match interface_ condition when there can only be a single interface matched. The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. 
 For example, this command is incorrect: 
  
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10 
  
 These commands are correct: 
  
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9 
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 30 match interface swp10

The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. 
 For example, this command is incorrect: 
  
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10 
  
 These commands are correct: 
  
 net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9

 The MAC address allocated to the SVI is inherited by the bridge (by default). The bridge inherits the MAC address from a physical interface (swp*).

 For this example, the MAC address of SVI {{vlan123}} is statically configured as sw01 = MM:MM:MM:11:11:11 and sw02 = MM:MM:MM:22:22:22.

This occurs when the memory is accessed either by a packet hit or through a schan operation. This issue can cause SER errors in other memory and cause traffic mis-forwarding or a packet drop.</td>

<td>On a Cumulus Linux switch, if a bridge has VXLAN interfaces, then the {{arp_accept}} and {{arp_ignore}} options do not work for any switch virtual interfaces (SVIs). 
 To work around this issue, disable ARP suppression on the VXLAN interfaces. For example, if the VXLAN is named vni100, disable ARP suppression on it with the following command: 
  
 cumulus@switch:~$ net add vxlan vni100 bridge arp-nd-suppress off 
 cumulus@switch:~$ net commit 
  
 This issue should be fixed in a future release of Cumulus Linux.</td>

<td>In a VXLAN centralized routing configuration, IPv6 hosts (auto-configured using SLAAC) might experience intermittent connectivity loss between VXLAN segments (inter-subnet routing) within the data center fabric (EVPN type-5 external routes are not affected). 
The NA message has the wrong flag set (the router flag is not set, which is incorrect behavior based on RFC 4861, Section 4.4). 
To work around this issue, configure {{bridge-arp-nd-suppress off}} under VNI interfaces for all VTEP devices.</td>
