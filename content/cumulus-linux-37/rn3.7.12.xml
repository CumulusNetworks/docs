<p>CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/>

rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>
Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>
The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration.</p></td>

<td><p>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and lldpd is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (<a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv</a>). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>
To check if lldpd is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:</p>

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head


<p>Alternatively, check for messages in the /var/log/syslog directory similar to:</p>

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%
2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND

<p><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for lldpd to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the bridge-vids list to include the VLANs being used).</li>
	<li>Stop the lldpd service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the lldpd service (runtime setting), run the sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service command. To disable the lldpd service upon boot, run sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service.</li>

CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>
CVE-2019-20054: In the Linux kernel before 5.0.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table() in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c, related to put_links, aka CID-23da9588037e.</p></td>

<td><p>CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack) is a network vulnerability where an attacker can trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly with specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service. On a Cumulus Linux switch, the impact is limited to control plane and management plane traffic. Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.<br/>
To work around this issue, create a file called /etc/sysctl.d/ip.conf and add these settings:</p>
