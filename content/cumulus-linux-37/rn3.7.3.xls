<td><p>The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.</p>

<p>CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/>

Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>
The default <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable <tt>$UDPServerRun</tt> or <tt>$InputTCPServerRun</tt>, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration.

<td><p>The following CVEs were announced that affect the Linux kernel:<br/>
CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>
CVE-2019-20054: In the Linux kernel before 5.0.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table() in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c, related to put_links, aka CID-23da9588037e.</p></td>

<td><p>The following CVEs were announced in a Debian Security Advisory that affects vim modelines. <br/>
 Package: vim and neovim <br/>
 CVE ID: CVE-2019-12735 <br/>
 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 <br/>
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the <tt>vimrc</tt> file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns <tt>nomodeline</tt>, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your <tt>vimrc</tt> file: </p>
 <div class="preformatted" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">

<td><p>Debian issued the following security advisory, DSA-4231-1, which affects the libgcrypt20 package. This advisory applies only to the the Debian Stretch release. <br/>
Debian Jessie, upon which Cumulus Linux 3.0 - 3.6.2 is based, is vulnerable. <br/>
CVE-2018-0495 <br/>
It was discovered that Libgcrypt is prone to a local side-channel attack allowing recovery of ECDSA private keys. <br/>
For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.7.6-2+deb9u3. <br/>
We recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt20 packages. <br/>
For the detailed security status of libgcrypt20, refer to its security tracker page at: <br/>

<td><p>The python-crypto package, which is not installed by default on Cumulus Linux, but is present in the repository to be installed, has the following security vulnerability in the version available for Cumulus Linux 3.x:<br/>
CVE-2018-6594: lib/Crypto/PublicKey/ElGamal.py in PyCrypto through 2.6.1 generates weak ElGamal key parameters, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for PyCrypto's ElGamal implementation.<br/>
