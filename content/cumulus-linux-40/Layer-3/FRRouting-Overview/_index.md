Cumulus Linux uses FRRouting to provide the routing protocols for dynamic routing and supports the following routing protocols:

- Open Shortest Path First ({{<link url="Open-Shortest-Path-First-OSPF" text="v2">}} and {{<link url="Open-Shortest-Path-First-v3-OSPFv3" text="v3">}})
- {{<link url="Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP">}}

## Architecture

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/frrouting-overview-daemons.png" >}}

The FRRouting suite consists of various protocol-specific daemons and a protocol-independent daemon called `zebra`. Each of the protocol-specific daemons are responsible for running the relevant protocol and building the routing table based on the information exchanged.

It is not uncommon to have more than one protocol daemon running at the same time. For example, at the edge of an enterprise, protocols internal to an enterprise (called IGP for Interior Gateway Protocol) such as {{<link url="Open-Shortest-Path-First-OSPF" text="OSPF text">}} or RIP run alongside the protocols that connect an enterprise to the rest of the world (called EGP or Exterior Gateway Protocol) such as {{<link url="Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP" text="BGP text">}}.

## About zebra

`zebra` is the daemon that resolves the routes provided by multiple protocols (including the static routes you specify) and programs these routes in the Linux kernel via `netlink` (in Linux). The {{<exlink url="http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/zebra.html" text="FRRouting documentation">}} defines `zebra` as the IP routing manager for FRRouting that "provides kernel routing table updates, interface lookups, and redistribution of routes between different routing protocols."
