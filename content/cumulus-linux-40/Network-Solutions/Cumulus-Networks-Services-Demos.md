The Services team demos provide a virtual environment built using either VirtualBox or `libvirt` using Vagrant to manage the VMs. This environment utilizes the reference topology shown below. Vagrant and Cumulus VX can be used together to build virtual simulations of production networks to validate configurations, develop automation code and simulate failure scenarios.

## Reference Topology

The *reference topology* includes cabling (in DOT format for dual use with {{<link url="Prescriptive-Topology-Manager-PTM" text="PTM">}}), MAC addressing, IP addressing, switches and servers. This topology is blessed by the our Professional Services Team to fit a majority of designs seen in the field.

### Build the Topology

#### Virtual Appliance

You can build out the reference topology in hardware or using Cumulus VX. The {{<exlink url="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant" text="Cumulus Reference Topology using Vagrant">}} is
essentially the reference topology built out inside Vagrant with VirtualBox or KVM. The installation and setup instructions for bringing up the entire reference topology on a laptop or server are on the {{<exlink url="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant" text="cldemo-vagrant GitHub repo">}}.

#### Hardware

Any switch from the {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl" text="hardware compatibility list">}} is compatible with the topology as long as you follow the interface count from the table above. Of course, in your own production environment, you don't have to use exactly the same devices and cabling as outlined above.

### Demos

You can find an up to date list of all the demos in the {{<exlink url="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant#available-demos" text="cldemo-vagrant GitHub repository">}}, which is available to anyone free of charge.
