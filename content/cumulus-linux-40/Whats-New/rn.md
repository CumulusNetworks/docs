| <a name="CM-27422"></a> [CM-27422](#CM-27422) <a name="CM-27422"></a> <br /> | The control plane ACL files uses variables that were not defined, which results in an error on boot.<br/>Add the following two lines to the top of the file `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/00control_plane.rules`:<br /><pre>BOOTPC_PORT = 67<br />BOOTPS_PORT = 68<br /></pre></div></div> | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27367"></a> [CM-27367](#CM-27367) <a name="CM-27367"></a> <br /> | Under certain circumstances, `switchd` might crash, then restart, on Mellanox switches with the Spectrum or Spectrum-2 ASIC.   | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27275"></a> [CM-27275](#CM-27275) <a name="CM-27275"></a> <br /> | CVE-2018-12207: Improper invalidation for page table updates by a virtual guest operating system for multiple Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service of the host system via local access.<br/>Running hypervisors for virtual guest operating systems is not supported on Cumulus Linux.  Additionally, an affected package qemu is not included in the image, although it is available on upstream repo mirrors.   | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27254"></a> [CM-27254](#CM-27254) <a name="CM-27254"></a> <br /> | On Mellanox switches with the Spectrum and Spectrum-2 ASIC, IPv6 egress ACLs are not supported on subinterfaces. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27243"></a> [CM-27243](#CM-27243) <a name="CM-27243"></a> <br /> | The length of the netlink message is not set properly for non-bridge family type messages. The same length is used for both bridge and non-bridge family type messages even though the bridge family type message has an extra attribute. This causes extra bytes to be left over in non-bridge family type netlink messages. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | 3.7.11|
| <a name="CM-27229"></a> [CM-27229](#CM-27229) <a name="CM-27229"></a> <br /> | On a traditional bridge, VLAN tagged traffic is not discarded when it exceeds the port security MAC limit. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27184"></a> [CM-27184](#CM-27184) <a name="CM-27184"></a> <br /> | With the port security feature, if you change the number of MAC addresses allowed to access a port with the NCLU `net add interface <port> port-security mac-limit <number>` command, the `net show configuration commands` command might fail. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27179"></a> [CM-27179](#CM-27179) <a name="CM-27179"></a> <br /> | On rare occasions on a Mellanox SN3700C switch, if you insert and remove, then reinsert an AOC or QSFP28 optical transceiver quickly, port #32 might get stuck.<br/>To avoid this issue, wait 15 seconds before insertion and before removal of the module. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27143"></a> [CM-27143](#CM-27143) <a name="CM-27143"></a> <br /> | The CPU core temperature sensors are absent on the Dell S5248F-ON switch. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |

These logs are normal and are not directly a problem. However, the large number of messages can cause the logs to <em>rotate away</em> any previous history, which prevents you from tracing back events leading up to the restart. In a troubleshooting environment, this can be problematic. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-27131"></a> [CM-27131](#CM-27131) <a name="CM-27131"></a> <br /> | On switches with the Broadcom Tomahawk3 ASIC, such as the EdgeCore Minipack AS8000, SPAN and ERSPAN functionality is not supported. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |

| <a name="CM-26913"></a> [CM-26913](#CM-26913) <a name="CM-26913"></a> <br /> | FRR configuration commands for an SVI interface might have the \n misplaced in the output.  For example:<br /><pre>sudo sh -c "printf 'interface 50\nvrf TEST description L3 routing interface\n' >> /etc/frr/frr.conf"<br /></pre></div></div>should be:<br /><pre>sudo sh -c "printf 'interface 50 vrf TEST\ndescription L3 routing interface\n' >> /etc/frr/frr.conf"<br /></pre></div></div>To work around this issue, configure the interface manually in the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file. | 3.7.9-3.7.11, 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-26907"></a> [CM-26907](#CM-26907) <a name="CM-26907"></a> <br /> | NCLU incorrectly allows you to apply port security configuration on layer 2 and layer 3 ports that are not part of a bridge. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
| <a name="CM-26905"></a> [CM-26905](#CM-26905) <a name="CM-26905"></a> <br /> | When you update the hostname of a switch with the NCLU `net add hostname <hostname>` command, then run `net commit`, the `lldpd` service is not restarted and other devices still see the old name.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `sudo systemctl restart lldpd.service` command. | 3.7.10-3.7.11, 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |

To route the tenant traffic flows, the kernel must perform address resolution but has to wait for the `clagd` `init-delay` timer to expire before the bonds can forward traffic. During the time when the ARP entry is unresolved, packets might be dropped. <br/>During the `init-delay` period, the ARP cache is not yet populated so the problem exists until either the `init-delay` timer expires or `clagd` neighbor synchronization is complete. By default the `clagd` `init-delay` timer is set to 10 seconds and `clagd` neighbor synchronization occurs halfway through the `init-delay` period. Traffic resumes forwarding after one of the two criteria described above are met. <br/>You might see this issue in EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link. <br/>To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br/>In the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: <br /><pre> <br />ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ <br /><br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 <br />match as-path MY_ASN <br />set as-path prepend 4200000101 <br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20 <br /></pre></div></div>  | 3.7.6-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.0.1 | 3.7.11|

For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.<br /><br />To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:<br /><br /><pre><br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh<br /></pre><br /><br />After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.<br /><br />*Notes* <br /><br />* This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, we recommend you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.<br />* If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using <code>apt-get</code> and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.<br />* If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.1 | 4.2.0-4.4.0|

You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br />To check if <code>lldpd</code> is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:<br /><pre><br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu \| head<br /></pre><br />Alternatively, check for messages in the <code>/var/log/syslog</code> directory similar to:<br /><pre><br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd<br /></pre><br />*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for <code>lldpd</code> to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br />To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:<br />* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the <code>bridge-vids</code> list to include the VLANs being used).<br />* Stop the <code>lldpd</code> service.

The failure to install the default route causes complete reachability failure for the particular tenant on the affected racks. The routes that are not installed are seen as "inactive" in the routing subsystem (FRR) VRF routing table. This problem is rare and can occur only in EVPN configurations that have user-configured route targets (RTs) for tenant VRFs, and only following a restart of FRR.<br />To work around this issue, either restart the FRR service on the affected switch with the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command or bounce the layer 3 SVI for the affected VRF; for example:<br /><pre><br />ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123<br /></pre><br />You can run the <code>net show vrf vni</code> command to print a mapping of VRF : L3-VNI : L3-SVI. | 3.7.5-3.7.15 | |

| <a name="2542339"></a> [2542339](#2542339) <a name="2542339"></a> <br />CM-25415 | In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. <br />The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated. <br />To work around this issue, configure the BGP peering on a _new_ VLAN interface (for example, vlan4093) instead of the peer link sub-interface (peerlink.4094). <br /> | 3.7.6 | |
