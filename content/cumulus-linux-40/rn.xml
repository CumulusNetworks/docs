<td>CM-27719</td>
<td><p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the Ruby language, which could result in unauthorized access by bypassing intended path matchings, denial of service, or the execution of arbitrary code.<br/>
These vulnerabilities affect the ruby2.5 package that is available for optional installation in Cumulus Linux 4.x, but is not installed by default.<br/>
CVE-2019-15845: Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 mishandles path checking within File.fnmatch functions.<br/>
CVE-2019-16201: WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth in Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 has a regular expression Denial of Service cause by looping/backtracking. A victim must expose a WEBrick server that uses DigestAuth to the Internet or a untrusted network.<br/>
CVE-2019-16254: Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients.<br/>
CVE-2019-16255: Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows code injection if the first argument (aka the "command" argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.<br/>

<td><p>During the bring-up sequence following a reboot, VXLAN routed packets (tenant traffic flows) transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the clagd init-delay timer expires. <br/>
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd. To route the tenant traffic flows, the kernel must perform address resolution but has to wait for the clagd init-delay timer to expire before the bonds can forward traffic. During the time when the ARP entry is unresolved, packets might be dropped. <br/>
During the init-delay period, the ARP cache is not yet populated so the problem exists until either the init-delay timer expires or clagd neighbor synchronization is complete. By default the clagd init-delay timer is set to 10 seconds and clagd neighbor synchronization occurs halfway through the init-delay period. Traffic resumes forwarding after one of the two criteria described above are met. <br/>
You might see this issue in EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link. <br/>
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br/>
In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: </p>

 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ 

route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 
match as-path MY_ASN 
set as-path prepend 4200000101 
route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20

<td>The following vulnerabilities have been announced in the openssl packages:
CVE-2021-23840: Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
CVE-2021-23841: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
CVE-2019-1551: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.
CVE-2020-10933: An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.

<td>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:
{noformat}
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]
{noformat}
If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:
{noformat}
bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

This affects: ntp-4.2.8p12 (possibly earlier) and ntp-4.2.8p13
The fix for https://bugs.ntp.org/3445 introduced a bug whereby a system that is running ntp-4.2.8p12 or p13 that only has one unauthenticated time source can be attacked in a way that causes the victim's next poll to its source to be delayed, for as long as the attack is maintained.

CVE-2020-11501: GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.13 uses incorrect cryptography for DTLS. The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.

<td>Due to a packaging error, all switches installed from the same Cumulus Linux image have the same SSH host keys. This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by {{apt}} to a later release).

As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.

To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:

{code}
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
{code}

After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.

*Notes* 

* This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, we recommend you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.
* If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using {{apt-get}} and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.
* If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors ([https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv]). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:
{noformat}
cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head
{noformat}
Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:
{noformat}
2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%
2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd
{noformat}
*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

Uboot needs a special header to boot the kernel, which is not present. Without this header, when you use the {{apt upgrade}} command to upgrade Linux packages, {{uboot}} is unable to boot up the kernel. 
To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the Cumulus Linux image. Run the {{onie-select}} command to go into ONIE, and then use the {{nos-install}} command in ONIE to install a new image.

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.

<td>In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. 
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated. 
 To work around this issue, configure the BGP peering on a _new_ VLAN interface (for example, vlan4093) instead of the peer link sub-interface (peerlink.4094).

<td>The following CVEs were announced in Debian Security Advisory DSA-444-1, DSA-4447-1 and affect the linux kernel and microcode. 
Package: linux 
CVE ID: CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130 CVE-2019-11091 
Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way the Intel processor designs have implemented speculative forwarding of data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). 
This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory. 
See https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html for more details. 
To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install updated CPU microcode. Contact your hardware ndor for microcode uppdates.
In addition, this update includes a fix for a regression causing deadlocks inside the loopback driver. 
Fixed in version 4.19.76-1+cl4u1</td>

* If eth0 is configured in the management VRF, power cycle the switch; the eth0 configuration fails and reverts back to the default (auto-negotiation/1000). 
* If eth0 is configured in the default VRF and you power cycle after the crash, {{igb}} continues to crash on boot up (before getting to login prompt); power-cycle the switch, select the Advanced option in GRUB to boot to recovery mode, then modify the {{/etc/network/interfaces}} file.</td>
