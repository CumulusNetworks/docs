<td>When you configure BGP {{aggregate-address summary-only}} and any component route within the summary updates, all component routes within the summary update in the RIB on the device advertising the summary. This condition might result in increased CPU usage.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast
   aggregate-address 10.10.0.0/16 summary-only
   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0
   !
   address-family ipv4 unicast
   redistribute connected route-map DENY-COMPONENTS
   redistribute static
    exit-address-family

   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS deny 10
    match ip address prefix-list NO-COMPONENTS
   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS permit 20


This example assumes no other static routes are present. Otherwise, you might need to configure additional route maps to limit the static routes being redistributed. </td>

<td>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]

If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors ([https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv]). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%
2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

Without this header, when you use the {{apt upgrade}} command to upgrade Linux packages, {{uboot}} is unable to boot up the kernel. 
To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the Cumulus Linux image. Run the {{onie-select}} command to go into ONIE, and then use the {{nos-install}} command in ONIE to install a new image.

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.

<td>At a high CPU transmit traffic rate (for example, if there is unexpected CPU generated flooding or replication in software), when the ASIC packet driver cannot keep up with the transmit rate because there are no free DMA buffers, it can back pressure by suspending the switch port transmit queues. This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in {{No buffer space available}} error messages on protocol sockets.
When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a {{switchd}} restart.</td>

To work around this issue, configure Cumulus Linux to boot with the {{ntel_iommu=off}} kernel command option:

1. Open the {{/etc/default/grub}} file with a text editor.
2. Edit the {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}} variable by adding the string {{intel_iommu=off}} at the end.  For example: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=cel_e1031 console=ttyS1,115200n8 intel_iommu=off"
3. Run the {{update-grub}} command.
4. Reboot the switch.</td>

<td>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]

If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and {{lldpd}} is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors ([https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv]). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. 
To check if {{lldpd}} is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

Alternatively, check for messages in the {{/var/log/syslog}} directory similar to:

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%

*Note*: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for {{lldpd}} to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:
* If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the {{bridge-vids}} list to include the VLANs being used).
* Stop the {{lldpd}} service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the {{lldpd}} service (runtime setting), run the {{sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service}} command. To disable the {{lldpd}} service upon boot, run {{sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service}}.</td>

Without this header, when you use the {{apt upgrade}} command to upgrade Linux packages, {{uboot}} is unable to boot up the kernel. 
To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the Cumulus Linux image. Run the {{onie-select}} command to go into ONIE, and then use the {{nos-install}} command in ONIE to install a new image.

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by {{clagd}}.

<td>In a typical CLOS network, each leaf is connected to all spine nodes; VXLAN packets follow leaf-spine links. However certain failure scenarios or maintenance activity might result in the MLAG primary switch being isolated from the spine layer (the only available network path is now across the peer link). As a result, the MLAG primary switch fails to transmit VXLAN encapsulated packets out on the peer link. It is also possible for the MLAG secondary switch to be isolated from the spine layer and then the problem is seen on the MLAG secondary switch. 
 The issue occurs because the Broadcom Trident3 switch does not perform VLAN translation for VXLAN encapsulated packets where the tunnel is not terminated.

<td>On a Dell S5248F (Trident3) switch, packets from switch ports are forwarded to the CPU and are sometimes corrupted. The corruption might result in BGP peerings being down, which can lead to all VXLAN traffic to and from a node to be lost, causing an outage to dually connected hosts in a rack. 
To work around this issue, restart {{switchd}}.</td>

 To work around this issue, either delete the IP addresses without the /32 mask component or flush the IP addresses for the interface with the {{ip addr flush dev &lt;interface&gt;}} command.

<td>On a Dell S4048 switch, when you set the eth0 speed to 100, either with NCLU or by editing the {{/etc/network/interfaces}} file, the {{igb}} driver crashes, which brings down eth0. 
To work around this issue: 
* If eth0 is configured in the management VRF, power cycle the switch; the eth0 configuration fails and reverts back to the default (auto-negotiation/1000). 
* If eth0 is configured in the default VRF and you power cycle after the crash, {{igb}} continues to crash on boot up (before getting to login prompt); power-cycle the switch, select the Advanced option in GRUB to boot to recovery mode, then modify the {{/etc/network/interfaces}} file.</td>
