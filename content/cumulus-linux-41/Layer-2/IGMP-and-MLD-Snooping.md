IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) snooping are implemented in the bridge driver in the Cumulus Linux kernel and are enabled by default. IGMP snooping processes IGMP v1/v2/v3 reports received on a bridge port in a bridge to identify the hosts which would like to receive multicast traffic destined to that group.

{{%notice note%}}

IGMP and MLD snooping is supported over VXLAN bridges; however, this feature is *not* enabled by default. To enable IGMP and MLD over VXLAN, see {{<link url="#configure-igmpmld-snooping-over-vxlan" text="Configure IGMP/MLD Snooping over VXLAN">}}.

{{%/notice%}}

When an IGMPv2 leave message is received, a group specific query is sent to identify if there are any other hosts interested in that group, before the group is deleted.

An IGMP query message received on a port is used to identify the port that is connected to a router and is interested in receiving multicast traffic.

MLD snooping processes MLD v1/v2 reports, queries and v1 done messages for IPv6 groups. If IGMP or MLD snooping is disabled, multicast traffic gets flooded to all the bridge ports in the bridge. Similarly, in the absence of receivers in a VLAN, multicast traffic is flooded to all ports in the VLAN. The multicast group IP address is mapped to a multicast MAC address and a forwarding entry is created with a list of ports interested in receiving multicast traffic destined to that group.

## Configure IGMP/MLD Snooping over VXLAN

Cumulus Linux supports IGMP/MLD snooping over VXLAN bridges, where VXLAN ports are set as router ports, on Broadcom switches.

To enable IGMP/MLD snooping over VXLAN:

{{< tabs "TabID31 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge mcsnoop yes
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto bridge
iface bridge
  bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3
  bridge-vlan-aware yes
  bridge-vids 100 200
  bridge-pvid 1
  bridge-mcsnoop yes
...
```

Run the `ifreload -a` command to reload the configuration:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Also configure IGMP/MLD querier. See {{<link url="#configure-igmpmld-querier" text="Configure IGMP/MLD Querier">}}, below.

To disable IGMP/MLD snooping over VXLAN, run the `net add bridge <bridge> mcsnoop no` command.

## Configure IGMP/MLD Querier

If no multicast router is sending queries to configure IGMP/MLD querier on the switch, you can add a configuration similar to the following in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file. To enable IGMP and MLD snooping for a bridge, set `bridge-mcquerier` to *1* in the bridge stanza. By default, the source IP address of IGMP queries is 0.0.0.0. 

For an explanation of the relevant parameters, see the `ifupdown-addons-interfaces` man page.

For a {{<link url="VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode" text="VLAN-aware bridge">}}, use a configuration like the following:

```
...
auto bridge.100
vlan bridge.100
  bridge-igmp-querier-src 123.1.1.1

auto bridge
iface bridge
  bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3
  bridge-vlan-aware yes
  bridge-vids 100 200
  bridge-pvid 1
  bridge-mcquerier 1
...
```

For a VLAN-aware bridge, like *bridge* in the above example, to enable querier functionality for VLAN 100 in the bridge, set `bridge-mcquerier` to *1* in the bridge stanza and set `bridge-igmp-querier-src` to *123.1.1.1* in the bridge.100 stanza. 123.1.1.1 would typically be a loopback IP address.

You can specify a range of VLANs as well. For example:

```
...
auto bridge.[1-200]
vlan bridge.[1-200]
  bridge-igmp-querier-src 123.1.1.1
...
```

For a bridge in {{<link url="Traditional-Bridge-Mode" text="traditional mode">}}, you can set the source IP address of the queries to be the bridge IP address, configure `bridge-mcqifaddr 1`. Use a configuration like the following:

```
...
auto br0
iface br0
  address 192.0.2.10/24
  bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3
  bridge-vlan-aware no
  bridge-mcquerier 1
  bridge-mcqifaddr 1
...
```

## Disable IGMP and MLD Snooping

To disable IGMP and MLD snooping, set the `bridge-mcsnoop` value to *0*.

{{< tabs "TabID142 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge mcsnoop no
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file and set `bridge-mcsnoop to 0` in the bridge stanza:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto bridge
iface bridge
  bridge-mcquerier 1
  bridge-mcsnoop 0
  bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3
  bridge-pvid 1
  bridge-vids 100 200
  bridge-vlan-aware yes
...
```

Run the `ifreload -a` command to reload the configuration:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```

## Troubleshooting

To show the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge state, run the `brctl showstp <bridge>` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo brctl showstp bridge

To show the groups and bridge port state, run the NCLU `net show bridge mdb` command or the Linux `bridge mdb show` command. To show detailed router ports and group information, run the `bridge -d -s mdb show` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo bridge -d -s mdb show
  dev bridge port swp2 grp 234.10.10.10 temp 241.67
  dev bridge port swp1 grp 238.39.20.86 permanent 0.00
  dev bridge port swp1 grp 234.1.1.1 temp 235.43
  dev bridge port swp2 grp ff1a::9 permanent 0.00
  router ports on bridge: swp3
```
