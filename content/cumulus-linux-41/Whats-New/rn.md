| <a name="CM-31120"></a> [CM-31120](#CM-31120) <a name="CM-31120"></a> | In a traditional bridge configuration with `ip-forward off`, neighbors are synchronized to hardware with a `switchd` restart but are cleared when you flap the bridge interface. | 3.7.10-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31073"></a> [CM-31073](#CM-31073) <a name="CM-31073"></a> | When you set the `sysctl` settings `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra_defrtr` (to prevent acceptance of IPv6 default route advertisements) and `net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra_defrtr` (set for newly created interfaces), if you create a new virtual interface, any pre-existing interface does not start accepting IPv6 default route avertisements again.<br/>To work around this issue, when you create a new virtual interface, set `net.ipv6.conf.<interface>.accept_ra_defrtr` to 0 for all interfaces and run `sysctl -p --system`. | 3.7.12-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31057"></a> [CM-31057](#CM-31057) <a name="CM-31057"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced:<br/>CVE-2019-11360: A buffer overflow in `iptables-restore` in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to `add_param_to_argv` in `xshared.c`. | 3.0.0-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |

| <a name="CM-31016"></a> [CM-31016](#CM-31016) <a name="CM-31016"></a> | Changing the order of the bridge ports might cause the bridge MAC address to change, which flaps the bridge and its ports.<br/>To work around this issue, manually set the MAC address of the bridge interface by adding `hwaddress <mac-address>` to the bridge stanza in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file. | 3.0.0-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30957"></a> [CM-30957](#CM-30957) <a name="CM-30957"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in the json-c / libjson_c3 packages:<br/>CVE-2020-12762: json-c through 0.14 has an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write via a large JSON file, as demonstrated by printbuf_memappend.<br/>Vulnerable: 0.12.1+ds-2<br/>Fixed: 0.12.1+ds-2+deb10u1 | 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |

| <a name="CM-30872"></a> [CM-30872](#CM-30872) <a name="CM-30872"></a> | Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GRUB2 bootloader.<br/>CVE-2020-10713: A flaw in the grub.cfg parsing code was found allowing to break UEFI Secure Boot and load arbitrary code. Details can be found at <a href="https://www.eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot/</a><br/>CVE-2020-14308: It was discovered that grub_malloc does not validate the allocation size allowing for arithmetic overflow and subsequently a heap-based buffer overflow.<br/>CVE-2020-14309: An integer overflow in grub_squash_read_symlink may lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.<br/>CVE-2020-14310: An integer overflow in read_section_from_string may lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.<br/>CVE-2020-14311: An integer overflow in grub_ext2_read_link may lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.<br/>CVE-2020-15706: script: Avoid a use-after-free when redefining a function during execution.<br/>CVE-2020-15707: An integer overflow flaw was found in the initrd size handling.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 2.02+dfsg1-20, <= 2.02+dfsg1-cl4u1<br/>Fixed: 2.02+dfsg1-20+deb10u2, 2.02+dfsg1-cl4.2.1u1 | 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30863"></a> [CM-30863](#CM-30863) <a name="CM-30863"></a> | OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>-The user is authorized to `scp` but not `ssh` (based on the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses `scp -r` to copy over to the target computer.<br/>Be aware that restricting users to `scp` by using the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>If you want to use `scp -r` to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30856"></a> [CM-30856](#CM-30856) <a name="CM-30856"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in NGINX, which is installed by default on Cumulus Linux (however, the default NGINX configuration is not vulnerable, as it does not configure `error_page redirection`):<br/>CVE-2019-20372: NGINX before 1.17.7, with certain error_page configurations, allows HTTP request smuggling, as demonstrated by the ability of an attacker to read unauthorized web pages in environments where NGINX is being fronted by a load balancer.<br/>To work around this issue, do not use `error_page redirection` in the vulnerable configuration.  <a href="https://bertjwregeer.keybase.pub/2019-12-10%20-%20error_page%20request%20smuggling.pdf" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://bertjwregeer.keybase.pub/2019-12-10%20-%20error_page%20request%20smuggling.pdf</a> describes the vulnerability and the vulnerable configuration.<br/>Fixed: 1.14.2-2+deb10u2 | 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30832"></a> [CM-30832](#CM-30832) <a name="CM-30832"></a> | The Mellanox SN2700 switch intermittently reports PSU fan state changes with `Unable to read from device/fan1_input/pwm1` syslog messages. | 4.1.1-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30827"></a> [CM-30827](#CM-30827) <a name="CM-30827"></a> | If the MAC address of an SVI changes, `clagd` does not update its permanent neighbor entry for the local interface, and it does not report the change to its MLAG peer. This leaves the MLAG peer in a state where its permanent neighbor for the MLAG peer's SVI IP address continues to use the old MAC address, which causes routed traffic over this SVI to be dropped.<br/>To work around this issue, ifdown/ifup the SVI when a MAC address changes. | 3.7.12-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30826"></a> [CM-30826](#CM-30826) <a name="CM-30826"></a> | The following vulnerability has been announced in QEMU:<br/>CVE-2020-8608: In libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, tcp_subr.c misuses snprintf return values, leading to a buffer overflow in later code.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u6<br/>Fixed: 3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u7 | 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30565"></a> [CM-30565](#CM-30565) <a name="CM-30565"></a> | Several denial of service vulnerabilities have been announced in the `qemu` packages:<br/>CVE-2020-10756 CVE-2020-13361 CVE-2020-13362 CVE-2020-13754 CVE-2020-13659<br/>Vulnerable: <= 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u5<br/>Fixed: 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u6 | 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30546"></a> [CM-30546](#CM-30546) <a name="CM-30546"></a> | The following vulnerabilities have been announced in the `nss` packages, including `libnss3`, which may be used by other programs:<br/>CVE-2019-17006: Check length of inputs for cryptographic primitives<br/>CVE-2019-17023: After a HelloRetryRequest has been sent, the client may negotiate a lower protocol that TLS 1.3, resulting in an invalid state transition in the TLS State Machine. If the client gets into this state, incoming Application Data records will be ignored.<br/>CVE-2020-12399: NSS has shown timing differences when performing DSA signatures, which was exploitable and could eventually leak private keys.<br/>CVE-2020-12402: During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 3.42.1-1+deb10u2<br/>Fixed: 3.42.1-1+deb10u3 | 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30525"></a> [CM-30525](#CM-30525) <a name="CM-30525"></a> | When a specific PIM join/prune packet is received from a PIM neighbor the `pimd` process might crash with a core file. | 4.0.0-4.1.1 | 4.2.0|
| <a name="CM-30514"></a> [CM-30514](#CM-30514) <a name="CM-30514"></a> | In OVSDB high availability mode, deleting > 200 VLAN bindings might cause `ovs-vtepd` to crash.  Limit the deletion to 200 or fewer VLAN bindings. | 3.7.12-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30504"></a> [CM-30504](#CM-30504) <a name="CM-30504"></a> | When the OVSDB VTEP scale increases, the CPU utilization increases and eventually the switch (`ptmd`) fails to respond to the BFD, causing the BFD session to go down. As a result OVSDB cannot read the BFD socket status and outputs a warning in the `ovs-vtepd` debugs: `PTM socket error: Bad file descriptor`. | 3.7.12-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30503"></a> [CM-30503](#CM-30503) <a name="CM-30503"></a> | In OVSDB high availability mode, if you create, then delete a binding, the FDB entry is not replaced and you see an error. | 3.7.12-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30498"></a> [CM-30498](#CM-30498) <a name="CM-30498"></a> | There is a change to the default OVSDB bootstrapping process, where the script created now defaults to VLAN-aware bridge mode. If you want to use traditional bride mode, you need to force it by editing the `ovs-vtep-ctl` script generated by the bootstrap process. | 3.7.12-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30486"></a> [CM-30486](#CM-30486) <a name="CM-30486"></a> | A host migrated to an 802.1X MAB port within the same broadcast domain fails to have the correct FDB entry installed if a dynamic FDB entry for that MAC address exists from previous connectivity in the broadcast domain.<br/>To work around this issue, manually delete the dynamic FDB entry that is associated with the uplink trunk port. | 3.7.12-3.7.13, 4.1.1-4.2.0 | |

This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.<br/>CVE-2020-10933: An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 2.5.5-3+deb10u1<br/>Fixed: 2.5.5-3+deb10u2 | 4.0.0-4.1.1 | 4.2.0|

| <a name="CM-30231"></a> [CM-30231](#CM-30231) <a name="CM-30231"></a> | When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.<br/>This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.<br/>To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:<br /><pre>bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master<br />bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master &#91; static \| dynamic &#93;<br /></pre><br />If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:<br /><pre>bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static<br />bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master<br />bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master &#91; static \| dynamic &#93;<br /></pre><br /> | 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |

The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 3.6.7-4+deb10u2<br/>Not vulnerable: 3.6.7-4+deb10u3 | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| <a name="CM-29111"></a> [CM-29111](#CM-29111) | Due to a packaging error, all switches installed from the same Cumulus Linux image have the same SSH host keys. This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by `apt` to a later release).As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent"><pre class="code-java"><br />cumulus&#64;<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*<br />cumulus&#64;<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server<br />cumulus&#64;<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh<br /></pre><br />After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.<b>Notes</b> <ul>	<li>This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1.

Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |

This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by `apt` to a later release).As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent"><pre class="code-java"><br />cumulus&#64;<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*<br />cumulus&#64;<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server<br />cumulus&#64;<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh<br /></pre><br />After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.<b>Notes</b> <ul>	<li>This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, Cumulus Networks recommends you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.</li>	<li>If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using `apt-get` and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.</li>	<li>If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.</li></ul> | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 4.1.1-4.2.0, 4.2.0|

| <a name="CM-19454"></a> [CM-19454](#CM-19454) <a name="CM-19454"></a> | When you use NCLU to bring a bond admin down (`net add bond <bond> link down`), the bond interface goes into admin down state but the switch ports enslaved to the bond remain UP. If you are using bond-lacp-bypass-allow or balance-xor mode, the host might continue to send traffic. This traffic will be dropped because although the bond slaves are UP, they are not members of the bridge.<br/>To work around this issue, use the `sudo ifdown <bondname>` command. | 3.5.0-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-17934"></a> [CM-17934](#CM-17934) <a name="CM-17934"></a> | FRR tracks interface speed based on the value it learns from the Linux kernel for that interface. If the interface speed changes, FRR does not update its interface speed cache. This can lead to issues for routing protocols that derive metrics from interface speed as the cost can become out of sync with the interface speed.<br/>To work around this issue, manually define the routing protocol metric for these interfaces or restart FRR. | 3.7.6-3.7.13, 4.0.0-4.2.0 | |
| <a name="CM-17494"></a> [CM-17494](#CM-17494) <a name="CM-17494"></a> | In certain cases, a peer device sends an ARP request from a source IP address that is not on the connected subnet and the switch creates a STALE neighbor entry. Eventually, the switch attempts to keep the entry fresh and sends ARP requests to the host. If the host responds, the switch has REACHABLE neighbor entries for hosts that are not on the connected subnet. <br/>To work around this issue, change the value of `arp_ignore` to 2.

| <a name="CM-27586"></a> [CM-27586](#CM-27586) | CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and `lldpd` is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (<a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv</a>). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>To check if `lldpd` is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu \| head<br /></pre><br />Alternatively, check for messages in the `/var/log/syslog` directory similar to:<br /><pre>2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd<br /></pre><br /><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for `lldpd` to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:<ul>	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the `bridge-vids` list to include the VLANs being used).</li>	<li>Stop the `lldpd` service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the `lldpd` service (runtime setting), run the `sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service` command. To disable the `lldpd` service upon boot, run `sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service`.</li></ul> | 3.7.11-3.7.12, 4.0.0 | |
