This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in <code>No buffer space available</code> error messages on protocol sockets.<br />When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a <code>switchd</code> restart. | 3.7.0-3.7.15, 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

If you are using bond-lacp-bypass-allow or balance-xor mode, the host might continue to send traffic. This traffic will be dropped because although the bond slaves are UP, they are not members of the bridge.<br />To work around this issue, use the <code>sudo ifdown <bondname></code> command. | 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

Eventually, the switch attempts to keep the entry fresh and sends ARP requests to the host. If the host responds, the switch has REACHABLE neighbor entries for hosts that are not on the connected subnet. <br />To work around this issue, change the value of <code>arp_ignore</code> to 2.

| <a name="2548933"></a> [2548933](#2548933) <a name="2548933"></a> <br />CM-29151 | The following security vulnerability in the gnutls28 / libgnutls* packages has been announced for Cumulus Linux 4.x (Cumulus Linux 3.x is not vulnerable):<br />CVE-2020-11501: GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.13 uses incorrect cryptography for DTLS. The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.<br />Vulnerable: <= 3.6.7-4+deb10u2<br />Not vulnerable: 3.6.7-4+deb10u3 | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |
| <a name="2548854"></a> [2548854](#2548854) <a name="2548854"></a> <br />CM-29111 | Due to a packaging error, all switches installed from the same Cumulus Linux image have the same SSH host keys. This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by <code>apt</code> to a later release).<br /><br />As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.<br /><br />To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:<br /><br /><pre><br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh<br /></pre><br /><br />After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.<br /><br />*Notes* <br /><br />* This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, we recommend you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.<br />* If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using <code>apt-get</code> and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.<br />* If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | |

The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.<br />Vulnerable: <= 3.6.7-4+deb10u2<br />Not vulnerable: 3.6.7-4+deb10u3 | 4.0.0-4.1.0 | 4.1.1-4.4.0|

This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by <code>apt</code> to a later release).<br /><br />As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.<br /><br />To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:<br /><br /><pre><br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server<br />cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh<br /></pre><br /><br />After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.<br /><br />*Notes* <br /><br />* This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, we recommend you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.<br />* If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using <code>apt-get</code> and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.<br />* If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.<br /> | 4.0.0-4.1.1 | 4.2.0-4.4.0|

Updating this internal data structure does not delete links that are down due to the flapping. The size of this array then grows to contain both current peers as well as peers that should have been deleted during the flap processing. The contents of this array is processed by FRR to poll the links, which consumes CPU for all items in the array.

The VXLAN encapsulated BUM packets do not get forwarded to the CPU and do not go through the iptable redirection rule; only VXLAN encapsulated BFD packets get forwarded to the CPU due to the inner MAC DA lookup in hardware. <br />  | 3.7.0-3.7.15, 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

| <a name="2536242"></a> [2536242](#2536242) <a name="2536242"></a> <br />CM-22287 | On the EdgeCore AS7712 (Tomahawk) switch running in atomic mode, when a layer 3 ECMP path is brought down, traffic traversing the path stops working for about four seconds. When the switch is changed to non-atomic mode, the delay is less than one second. This issue is seen across OSPF and static ECMP routes.  | 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in <code>No buffer space available</code> error messages on protocol sockets.<br />When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a <code>switchd</code> restart. | 3.7.0-3.7.15, 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

If you are using bond-lacp-bypass-allow or balance-xor mode, the host might continue to send traffic. This traffic will be dropped because although the bond slaves are UP, they are not members of the bridge.<br />To work around this issue, use the <code>sudo ifdown <bondname></code> command. | 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |
| <a name="2531273"></a> [2531273](#2531273) <a name="2531273"></a> <br />CM-17494 | In certain cases, a peer device sends an ARP request from a source IP address that is not on the connected subnet and the switch creates a STALE neighbor entry. Eventually, the switch attempts to keep the entry fresh and sends ARP requests to the host. If the host responds, the switch has REACHABLE neighbor entries for hosts that are not on the connected subnet. <br />To work around this issue, change the value of <code>arp_ignore</code> to 2.

An example of where this two-layer VXLAN inside VXLAN encapsulation might occur:<br />- VXLAN tunnel (#1) between two servers (different racks) to provide layer 2 extension for containers or VM hosts.<br />- VXLAN tunnel (#2) between the TOR switch in rack 1 to the TOR switch located in the remote rack. <br /><br />To work around this issue, either:<br />- Configure the edge port (facing the servers) to be an access port (instead of a trunk/tagged port)<br />- Change the destination port from 4789 to something else (VXLAN tunnel terminated by the servers) | 3.7.5-3.7.11, 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |

The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br />In the <code>/etc/frr/frr.conf</code> file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: <br /><pre> <br />ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ <br /><br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 <br />match as-path MY_ASN <br />set as-path prepend 4200000101 <br />route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20 <br /></pre>  | 3.7.6-3.7.10, 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |
