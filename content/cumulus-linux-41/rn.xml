<td><p>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>
-The user is authorized to scp but not ssh (based on the command option in the authorized_keys file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses scp -r to copy over to the target computer.<br/>
Be aware that restricting users to scp by using the command option in the authorized_keys file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>
If you want to use scp -r to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with tar, zip, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use scp -r altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides sftp, which you can use instead of scp to copy files.<br/>
To disable scp completely, use /bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp .</p></td>

This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.<br/>
CVE-2020-10933: An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.<br/>

<td><p>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.<br/>
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.<br/>
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:</p>

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]


<p>If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:</p>

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]

<td><p>The following security vulnerability in the gnutls28 / libgnutls* packages has been announced for Cumulus Linux 4.x (Cumulus Linux 3.x is not vulnerable):<br/>
CVE-2020-11501: GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.13 uses incorrect cryptography for DTLS. The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.<br/>

<td><p>Due to a packaging error, all switches installed from the same Cumulus Linux image have the same SSH host keys. This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by apt to a later release).</p>

<p>As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:</p>



cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh



<p>After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b> </p>

<ul>
	<li>This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, Cumulus Networks recommends you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.</li>
	<li>If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using apt-get and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.</li>
	<li>If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.</li>

<td><p>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>
-The user is authorized to scp but not ssh (based on the command option in the authorized_keys file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses scp -r to copy over to the target computer.<br/>
Be aware that restricting users to scp by using the command option in the authorized_keys file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>
If you want to use scp -r to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with tar, zip, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use scp -r altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides sftp, which you can use instead of scp to copy files.<br/>

This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.<br/>
CVE-2020-10933: An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.<br/>

<td><p>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.<br/>
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.<br/>
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:</p>

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]


<p>If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:</p>

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

<td><p>Due to a packaging error, all switches installed from the same Cumulus Linux image have the same SSH host keys. This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by apt to a later release).</p>

<p>As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:</p>



cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh



<p>After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b> </p>

<ul>
	<li>This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, Cumulus Networks recommends you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.</li>
	<li>If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using apt-get and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.</li>
	<li>If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.</li>

<td><p>CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and lldpd is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (<a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv</a>). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>
To check if lldpd is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:</p>

cumulus@switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head


<p>Alternatively, check for messages in the /var/log/syslog directory similar to:</p>

2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%
2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND

<p><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for lldpd to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>
To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the bridge-vids list to include the VLANs being used).</li>
	<li>Stop the lldpd service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the lldpd service (runtime setting), run the sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service command. To disable the lldpd service upon boot, run sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service.</li>

<td><p>On the Broadcom Trident 3 switch, VXLAN encapsulated packets are dropped on the ingress port (tagged layer 2 port) during transit forwarding (the local switch does not terminate the VXLAN tunnel). An example of where this two-layer VXLAN inside VXLAN encapsulation might occur:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>VXLAN tunnel (#1) between two servers (different racks) to provide layer 2 extension for containers or VM hosts.</li>
	<li>VXLAN tunnel (#2) between the TOR switch in rack 1 to the TOR switch located in the remote rack.</li>
</ul>


<p>To work around this issue, either:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Configure the edge port (facing the servers) to be an access port (instead of a trunk/tagged port)</li>
	<li>Change the destination port from 4789 to something else (VXLAN tunnel terminated by the servers)</li>

<td><p>In EVPN symmetric or centralized configurations with BGP peering over a peer link, VXLAN routed packets transiting an MLAG peer are dropped until the clagd init-delay timer expires during the bring-up sequence following a reboot.<br/>
The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd.<br/>
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br/>
In the /etc/frr/frr.conf file, make a new AS path access list and route map to apply BGP pre-pending of the local ASN one or more times. For example: </p>

 
ip as-path access-list MY_ASN permit ^$ 

route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 10 
match as-path MY_ASN 
set as-path prepend 4200000101 
route-map peerlink-add-asn permit 20

<td><p>CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack) is a network vulnerability where an attacker can trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly with specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service.

Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.<br/>
