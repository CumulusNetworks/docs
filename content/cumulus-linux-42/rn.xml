<td>The following vulnerabilities have been announced in the openssl packages:
CVE-2021-23840: Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
CVE-2021-23841: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
CVE-2019-1551: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.
To disable scp completely, use {{/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp}} .</td>

<td>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]

If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042

rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux) with the pmaisforwardedfrom or pmcisconames optional log parsers (also not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.
Vulnerable: 8.1901.0-1

Recommendation:

Do not enable receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun).  Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.  The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does not enable any of these.

In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
CVE-2021-23841: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
CVE-2019-1551: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

The EEPROM bytes for RX amplitude control (page 03h, bytes #236-239) are defined as volatile in the SFF specification (SFF-8634/8636); after the module power is off, the EEPROM values should return to their defaults. However, these bytes are observed to be non-volatile in the modules listed below.

<td>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]

If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

Vulnerable: 8.1901.0-1

Recommendation:

Do not enable receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun).  Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.  The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does not enable any of these.

<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094): 
* {{clagd}} uses an IPv6 link-local address (LLA) to establish the TCP connection (the {{clagd-peer-ip linklocal}} command configures an IPv6 LLA connection)

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

To workaround this issue, use IPv4 addresses under {{peerlink.4094}} and configure {{clagd}} to peer on IPv4 addresses.</td>

This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.
CVE-2020-10933: An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.

<td>Due to a packaging error, all switches installed from the same Cumulus Linux image have the same SSH host keys. This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by {{apt}} to a later release).

As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.

To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:

{code}
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
{code}

After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.

*Notes* 

* This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, we recommend you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.
* If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using {{apt-get}} and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.
* If you perform a fresh install of Cumulus Linux 4.1.1 or later using a disk image, you will lose your existing local configuration.
