<td><p>The following vulnerabilities were announced in the p11-kit (libp11-kit0) packages:<br/>
CVE-2020-29361: Multiple integer overflows have been discovered in the array allocations in the p11-kit library and the p11-kit list command, where overflow checks are missing before calling realloc or calloc.<br/>
CVE-2020-29362: A heap-based buffer over-read has been discovered in the RPC protocol used by thep11-kit server/remote commands and the client library. When the remote entity supplies a byte array through a serialized PKCS#11 function call, the receiving entity may allow the reading of up to 4 bytes of memory past the heap allocation.<br/>
CVE-2020-29363: A heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in the RPC protocol used by p11-kit server/remote commands and the client library. When the remote entity supplies a serialized byte array in a CK_ATTRIBUTE, the receiving entity may not allocate sufficient length for the buffer to store the deserialized value.<br/>

<td><p>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>
-The user is authorized to scp but not ssh (based on the command option in the authorized_keys file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses scp -r to copy over to the target computer.<br/>
Be aware that restricting users to scp by using the command option in the authorized_keys file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>
If you want to use scp -r to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with tar, zip, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use scp -r altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides sftp, which you can use instead of scp to copy files.<br/>
To disable scp completely, use /bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp .</p></td>

This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.<br/>
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.<br/>
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:</p>

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]


<p>If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:</p>

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

Vulnerable: 8.1901.0-1</p>

<p>Recommendation:</p>

<p>Do not enable receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun).  Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.  The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does not enable any of these.</p></td>

<td><p>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>
-The user is authorized to scp but not ssh (based on the command option in the authorized_keys file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses scp -r to copy over to the target computer.<br/>
Be aware that restricting users to scp by using the command option in the authorized_keys file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>
If you want to use scp -r to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with tar, zip, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use scp -r altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides sftp, which you can use instead of scp to copy files.<br/>

<td><p>When the dynamic or static flag on a bridge fdb (MAC) entry is changed to the opposite state, the new flag is not set appropriately in hardware. This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.<br/>
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.<br/>
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:</p>

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]


<p>If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:</p>

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.<br/>
CVE-2020-10933: An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.<br/>

<td><p>Due to a packaging error, all switches installed from the same Cumulus Linux image have the same SSH host keys. This affects switches originally installed with Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and 4.1.0 from a disk image only (including those that were upgraded by apt to a later release).</p>

<p>As a result, this issue allows an attacker to more easily bypass remote host verification when a user connects by SSH to what is believed to be a previously used remote host but is really the attacker's host. For example, this issue can be exploited by a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, generate new SSH host keys for any switch that has Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 installed on it:</p>



cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
cumulus@<span class="code-keyword">switch</span>:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh



<p>After generating new SSH host keys, SSH clients that have previously logged into that switch will see a warning that the switch's SSH host key changed; this is expected behavior. Be sure to inform anyone who may log in to the switch that you generated new SSH host keys. These users must log in to the affected switches with their SSH clients, where they will be given instructions on how to remove the old SSH host keys from the known hosts files to avoid a spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack directed at their SSH clients.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b> </p>

<ul>
	<li>This issue is fixed in Cumulus Linux 4.1.1. However, we recommend you generate new SSH host keys as this is the most reliable solution.</li>
	<li>If you upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to version 4.1.1 or later using apt-get and you didn't generate new SSH host keys, you will need to generate new SSH host keys after the upgrade.</li>

To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the Cumulus Linux image. Run the onie-select command to go into ONIE, and then use the nos-install command in ONIE to install a new image.<br/>
