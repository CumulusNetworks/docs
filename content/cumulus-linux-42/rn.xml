<td>When you try to upgrade a switch from Cumulus Linux before 5.6.0 with package upgrade, you might see errors for expired GPG keys that prevent you from upgrading. To work around this issue, install the new keys with the following commands, then upgrade the switch.

<td>When zebra receives route updates that include both a route with a recursive next hop and the route used to resolve that next hop, zebra might mark the route with the recursive next hop as inactive.

For example, for BGP, clear inbound routes from the relevant neighbor using the {{nv action clear vrf &lt;vrf&gt; router bgp neighbor &lt;neighbor&gt; address-family &lt;address-family&gt; in}} command.</td>

This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]

If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

These errors are result of  user space acting on kernel events a bit slow. The mlxsw_minimal driver is added during kernel boot; An SDK reset causes the driver to be deleted and re-instantiated; User space handler for thermal zone add sees the add first; But the underlying device is deleted before it can act on it. This situation is rectified as the mlxsw_minimal driver is re-instantiated later;

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>

even though cl-resources-query does not reflect that the ECMP NH table is full. The reason is that a temporary/artificial ECMP container exhaustion occurs due to a churn in routes and how switchd cleans up the routes, nexthops and RIFs. While performing this route cleanup operation, if switchd tries to delete a RIF and is unable to (since there are ECMP next-hops pointing to it which are yet to be deleted) it puts the RIF in a pending list. So, as a result, all of the ECMP next-hops pointing to the RIF also would be pending deletion.

even though cl-resources-query does not reflect that the ECMP NH table is full. The reason is that a temporary/artificial ECMP container exhaustion occurs due to a churn in routes and how switchd cleans up the routes, nexthops and RIFs. While performing this route cleanup operation, if switchd tries to delete a RIF and is unable to (since there are ECMP next-hops pointing to it which are yet to be deleted) it puts the RIF in a pending list. So, as a result, all of the ECMP next-hops pointing to the RIF also would be pending deletion. As a result, RIFs and dependent ECMP next-hops linger on the pending list until the next RIF sync is done, at which point the next-hops are freed up and the routes get installed as expected.</td>

This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.

<td>2553000</td>
<td>When the following conditions exist, {{clagd}} might fail to establish a TCP control session across the subinterface (such as, peerlink.4094): 
* {{clagd}} uses an IPv6 link-local address (LLA) to establish the TCP connection (the {{clagd-peer-ip linklocal}} command configures an IPv6 LLA connection)

* Subsequent VLAN changes are made to VLAN sub-interfaces or adding or removing SVIs

This issue occurs because the hardware stores one entry per VRF to represent the IPv6 LLA. The hardware entry for the LLA is removed when another interface is changed because the software interfaces are represented by a single entity in hardware. As a result, packets destined to the local IPv6 LLA address are received on the port but do not get forwarded to CPU for further processing.

To workaround this issue, use IPv4 addresses under {{peerlink.4094}} and configure {{clagd}} to peer on IPv4 addresses.</td>

To work around this issue, remove all interfaces from the {{/etc/frr/frr.conf}} file that are unrelated to routing. </td>

<td>If you reconfigure an NTP server with NCLU using different trailing options after the IP address (such as {{iburst}}), an invalid configuration is added to the {{/etc/ntp.conf}} file. For example:

net add time ntp server 1.2.3.4 iburst
net commit
net add time ntp server 1.2.3.4
net commit

If you need to alter existing server configurations, first remove the server, commit, then re-add the server with any trailing options.</td>

<td>On the EdgeCore AS4610 switch, the {{ping}} command fails unless you run the command with {{sudo}}. 
 To work around this issue, run the following commands: 

 cumulus@switch:~$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping 
 cumulus@switch:~$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping6

 Run the following command to verify the workaround: 
  
 cumulus@switch:~$ getcap /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping* 
  
 You should see the following output: 
  
 /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep 
 /usr/share/mgmt-vrf/bin/ping6 = cap_net_raw+ep
