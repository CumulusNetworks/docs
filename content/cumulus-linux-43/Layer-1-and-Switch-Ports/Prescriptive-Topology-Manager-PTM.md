In data center topologies, right cabling is a time-consuming endeavor and is error prone. Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM) is a dynamic cabling verification tool to help detect and eliminate such errors. It takes a Graphviz-DOT specified network cabling plan (something many operators already generate), stored in a `topology.dot` file, and couples it with runtime information derived from LLDP to verify that the cabling matches the specification. The check is performed on every link transition on each node in the network.

You can customize the `topology.dot` file to control `ptmd` at both the global/network level and the node/port level.

PTM runs as a daemon, named `ptmd`.

For more information, see `man ptmd(8)`.

## Supported Features

- Topology verification using LLDP. `ptmd` creates a client connection to the LLDP daemon, `lldpd`, and retrieves the neighbor relationship between the nodes/ports in the network and compares them against the prescribed topology specified in the `topology.dot` file.
- Only physical interfaces, such as swp1 or eth0, are currently supported. Cumulus Linux does not support specifying virtual interfaces, such as bonds or subinterfaces, such as eth0.200 in the topology file.
- Forwarding path failure detection using {{<exlink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880" text="Bidirectional Forwarding Detection">}} (BFD); however, demand mode is not supported. For more information on how BFD operates in Cumulus Linux, read the {{<link title="Bidirectional Forwarding Detection - BFD">}} chapter and read `man ptmd(8)`.
- Integration with FRRouting (PTM to FRRouting notification).
- Client management: `ptmd` creates an abstract named socket `/var/run/ptmd.socket` on startup. Other applications can connect to this socket to receive notifications and send commands.
- Event notifications: see Scripts below.
- User configuration via a `topology.dot` file; {{<link url="#configure-ptm" text="see below">}}.

## Configure PTM

`ptmd` verifies the physical network topology against a DOT-specified network graph file, `/etc/ptm.d/topology.dot`.

PTM supports {{<exlink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29" text="undirected graphs">}}.

At startup, `ptmd` connects to `lldpd`, the LLDP daemon, over a Unix socket and retrieves the neighbor name and port information. It then compares the retrieved port information with the configuration information that it read from the topology file. If there is a match, it is a PASS, else it is a FAIL.

{{%notice note%}}

PTM performs its LLDP neighbor check using the PortID ifname TLV information.

{{%/notice%}}

## ptmd Scripts

`ptmd` executes scripts at `/etc/ptm.d/if-topo-pass` and `/etc/ptm.d/if-topo-fail`for each interface that goes through a change and runs `if-topo-pass` when an LLDP or BFD check passes or `if-topo-fails` when the check fails. The scripts receive an argument string that is the result of the `ptmctl` command, described in the {{%link url="#ptmd-service-commands" text="`ptmd` commands below"%}}.

Modify these default scripts as needed.

## Configuration Parameters

You can configure `ptmd` parameters in the topology file. The parameters are classified as host-only, global, per-port/node and templates.

### Host-only Parameters

*Host-only parameters* apply to the entire host on which PTM is running. You can include the `hostnametype` host-only parameter, which specifies if PTM uses only the host name (`hostname`) or the fully-qualified
domain name (`fqdn`) while looking for the `self-node` in the graph file. For example, in the graph file below PTM ignores the FQDN and only looks for *switch04* because that is the host name of the switch on which it is running:

{{%notice tip%}}

Cumulus Networks recommends you always wrap the hostname in double quotes; for example, `"www.example.com"` to prevent `ptmd` from failing.

To avoid errors when starting the `ptmd` process, make sure that `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname` both reflect the hostname you are using in the `topology.dot` file.

{{%/notice%}}

```
graph G {
          hostnametype="hostname"
          BFD="upMinTx=150,requiredMinRx=250"
          "cumulus":"swp44" -- "switch04.cumulusnetworks.com":"swp20"
          "cumulus":"swp46" -- "switch04.cumulusnetworks.com":"swp22"
}
```

In this next example, PTM compares using the FQDN and looks for *switch05.cumulusnetworks.com*, which is the FQDN of the switch ion which it is running:

```
graph G {
          hostnametype="fqdn"
          "cumulus":"swp44" -- "switch05.cumulusnetworks.com":"swp20"
          "cumulus":"swp46" -- "switch05.cumulusnetworks.com":"swp22"
}
```

### Global Parameters

*Global parameters* apply to every port listed in the topology file. There are two global parameters: LLDP and BFD. LLDP is enabled by default; if no keyword is present, default values are used for all ports. However, BFD is disabled if no keyword is present, unless there is a per-port override configured. For example:

```
graph G {
          LLDP=""
          BFD="upMinTx=150,requiredMinRx=250,afi=both"
          "cumulus":"swp44" -- "qct-ly2-04":"swp20"
          "cumulus":"swp46" -- "qct-ly2-04":"swp22"
}
```

### Per-port Parameters

*Per-port parameters* provide finer-grained control at the port level. These parameters override any global or compiled defaults. For example:

```
graph G {
          LLDP=""
          BFD="upMinTx=300,requiredMinRx=100"
          "cumulus":"swp44" -- "qct-ly2-04":"swp20" [BFD="upMinTx=150,requiredMinRx=250,afi=both"]
          "cumulus":"swp46" -- "qct-ly2-04":"swp22"
}
```

### Templates

*Templates* provide flexibility in choosing different parameter combinations and applying them to a given port. A template instructs `ptmd` to reference a named parameter string instead of a default one. There are two parameter strings `ptmd` supports:

- `bfdtmpl` specifies a custom parameter tuple for BFD.
- `lldptmpl` specifies a custom parameter tuple for LLDP.

For example:

```
graph G {
          LLDP=""
          BFD="upMinTx=300,requiredMinRx=100"
          BFD1="upMinTx=200,requiredMinRx=200"
          BFD2="upMinTx=100,requiredMinRx=300"
          LLDP1="match_type=ifname"
          LLDP2="match_type=portdescr"
          "cumulus":"swp44" -- "qct-ly2-04":"swp20" [BFD="bfdtmpl=BFD1", LLDP="lldptmpl=LLDP1"]
          "cumulus":"swp46" -- "qct-ly2-04":"swp22" [BFD="bfdtmpl=BFD2", LLDP="lldptmpl=LLDP2"]
          "cumulus":"swp46" -- "qct-ly2-04":"swp22"
}
```

In this template, LLDP1 and LLDP2 are templates for LLDP parameters. BFD1 and BFD2 are templates for BFD parameters.

### Supported BFD and LLDP Parameters

`ptmd` supports the following BFD parameters:

- `upMinTx` is the minimum transmit interval, which defaults to *300ms*, specified in milliseconds.
- `requiredMinRx` is the minimum interval between received BFD packets, which defaults to *300ms*, specified in milliseconds.
- `detectMult` is the detect multiplier, which defaults to *3*, and can be any non-zero value.
- `afi` is the address family to be supported for the edge. The address family must be one of the following:
  - *v4*: BFD sessions will be built for only IPv4 connected peer. This is the default value.
  - *v6*: BFD sessions will be built for only IPv6 connected peer.
  - *both*: BFD sessions will be built for both IPv4 and IPv6 connected peers.

The following is an example of a topology with BFD applied at the port level:

```
graph G {
          "cumulus-1":"swp44" -- "cumulus-2":"swp20" [BFD="upMinTx=300,requiredMinRx=100,afi=v6"]
          "cumulus-1":"swp46" -- "cumulus-2":"swp22" [BFD="detectMult=4"]
}
```

`ptmd` supports the following LLDP parameters:

- `match_type`, which defaults to the interface name (`ifname`), but can accept a port description (`portdescr`) instead if you want `lldpd` to compare the topology against the port description instead of the interface name. You can set this parameter globally or at the per-port level.
- `match_hostname`, which defaults to the host name (`hostname`), but enables PTM to match the topology using the fully-qualified domain name (`fqdn`) supplied by LLDP.

The following is an example of a topology with LLDP applied at the port level:

```
graph G {
          "cumulus-1":"swp44" -- "cumulus-2":"swp20" [LLDP="match_hostname=fqdn"]
          "cumulus-1":"swp46" -- "cumulus-2":"swp22" [LLDP="match_type=portdescr"]
}
```

{{%notice note%}}

When you specify `match_hostname=fqdn`, `ptmd` will match the entire FQDN, (*cumulus-2.domain.com* in the example below). If you do not specify anything for `match_hostname`, `ptmd` matches based on hostname only, (*cumulus-3* below), and ignores the rest of the URL:

```
graph G {
          "cumulus-1":"swp44" -- "cumulus-2.domain.com":"swp20" [LLDP="match_hostname=fqdn"]
          "cumulus-1":"swp46" -- "cumulus-3":"swp22" [LLDP="match_type=portdescr"]
}
```

{{%/notice%}}

## Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)

BFD provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection. For information about configuring BFD using PTM, see {{<link url="Bidirectional-Forwarding-Detection-BFD" text="BFD">}}.

## Check Link State with FRRouting

The FRRouting routing suite enables additional checks to ensure that routing adjacencies are formed only on links that have connectivity conformant to the specification, as determined by `ptmd`.

{{%notice note%}}

You only need to do this to check link state; you do not need to enable PTM to determine BFD status.

{{%/notice%}}

When the global `ptm-enable` option is enabled, every interface has an implied `ptm-enable` line in the configuration stanza in the interfaces file.

To enable the global `ptm-enable` option, run the following FRRouting command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh

switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# ptm-enable
switch(config)# end
switch# write memory
switch# exit
cumulus@switch:~$
```

To disable the checks, delete the `ptm-enable` parameter from the interface:

{{< tabs "TabID234 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net del interface swp51 ptm-enable
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "vtysh Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
switch# conf t
switch(config)# interface swp51
switch(config-if)# no ptm-enable
switch(config-if)# end
switch# write memory
switch# exit
cumulus@switch:~$
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

If you need to re-enable PTM for that interface:

{{< tabs "TabID265 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp51 ptm-enable
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "vtysh Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
switch# conf t
switch(config)# interface swp51
switch(config-if)# ptm-enable

switch(config-if)# end
switch# write memory
switch# exit
cumulus@switch:~$
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

With PTM enabled on an interface, the `zebra` daemon connects to `ptmd` over a Unix socket. Any time there is a change of status for an interface, `ptmd` sends notifications to `zebra`. Zebra maintains a `ptm-status` flag per interface and evaluates routing adjacency based on this flag. To check the per-interface `ptm-status`:

{{< tabs "TabID297 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show interface swp1

Interface swp1 is up, line protocol is up
  Link ups:       0    last: (never)
  Link downs:     0    last: (never)
  PTM status: disabled
  vrf: Default-IP-Routing-Table
  index 3 metric 0 mtu 1550
  flags: <UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>
  HWaddr: c4:54:44:bd:01:41
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "vtysh Commands ">}}

```
switch# show interface swp1
Interface swp1 is up, line protocol is up
  Link ups:       0    last: (never)
  Link downs:     0    last: (never)
  PTM status: disabled
  vrf: Default-IP-Routing-Table
  index 3 metric 0 mtu 1550
  flags: <UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>
  HWaddr: c4:54:44:bd:01:41
...
```

{{< /tab >}}

## ptmd Service Commands

PTM sends client notifications in CSV format.

To start or restart the `ptmd` service, run the following command. The `topology.dot` file must be present for the service to start.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl start|restart|force-reload ptmd.service
```

To instruct `ptmd` to read the `topology.dot` file again to apply the new configuration to the running state without restarting:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl reload ptmd.service
```

To stop the `ptmd` service:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl stop ptmd.service
```

To retrieve the current running state of `ptmd`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl status ptmd.service
```

## ptmctl Commands

`ptmctl` is a client of `ptmd` that retrieves the operational state of the ports configured on the switch and information about BFD sessions from `ptmd`. `ptmctl` parses the CSV notifications sent by `ptmd`. See `man ptmctl` for more information.

### ptmctl Examples

The examples below contain the following keywords in the output of the `cbl status` column:

| cbl status Keyword<img width=200/> | Definition<img width=400/> |
|-------- |-------- |
| pass | The interface is defined in the topology file, LLDP information is received on the interface, and the LLDP information for the interface matches the information in the topology file. |
| fail | The interface is defined in the topology file, LLDP information is received on the interface, and the LLDP information for the interface does not match the information in the topology file. |
| N/A | The interface is defined in the topology file, but no LLDP information is received on the interface. The interface might be down or disconnected, or the neighbor is not sending LLDP packets.<br>The `N/A` and `fail` status might indicate a wiring problem to investigate.<br>The `N/A` status is not shown when you use the `-l` option with `ptmctl`; only interfaces that are receiving LLDP information are shown. |

For basic output, use `ptmctl` without any options:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ptmctl

-------------------------------------------------------------
port  cbl     BFD     BFD                  BFD    BFD
      status  status  peer                 local  type
-------------------------------------------------------------
swp1  pass    pass    11.0.0.2             N/A    singlehop
swp2  pass    N/A     N/A                  N/A    N/A
swp3  pass    N/A     N/A                  N/A    N/A
```

For more detailed output, use the `-d` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ptmctl -d

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
port  cbl    exp     act      sysname  portID  portDescr  match  last    BFD   BFD

```

To return information on active BFD sessions `ptmd` is tracking, use the `-b` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ptmctl -b

----------------------------------------------------------
port  peer        state  local         type       diag

----------------------------------------------------------
swp1  11.0.0.2    Up     N/A           singlehop  N/A
N/A   12.12.12.1  Up     12.12.12.4    multihop   N/A
```

To return LLDP information, use the `-l` option. It returns only the active neighbors currently being tracked by `ptmd`.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ptmctl -l

---------------------------------------------
port  sysname  portID  port   match  last
                       descr  on     upd

swp46 h2       swp1    swp1   IfName 5m:59s
```

To return detailed information on active BFD sessions `ptmd` is tracking, use the `-b` and `-d` option (results are for an IPv6-connected peer):

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ptmctl -b -d

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
port  peer                 state  local  type       diag  det   tx_timeout  rx_timeout

```

### ptmctl Error Outputs

If there are errors in the topology file or there is no session, PTM returns appropriate outputs. Typical error strings are:

```
Topology file error [/etc/ptm.d/topology.dot] [cannot find node cumulus] -
please check /var/log/ptmd.log for more info

Topology file error [/etc/ptm.d/topology.dot] [cannot open file (errno 2)] -
please check /var/log/ptmd.log for more info

No Hostname/MgmtIP found [Check LLDPD daemon status] -
please check /var/log/ptmd.log for more info

No BFD sessions . Check connections

No LLDP ports detected. Check connections

Unsupported command
```

For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ptmctl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
cmd         error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
get-status  Topology file error [/etc/ptm.d/topology.dot]
            [cannot open file (errno 2)] - please check /var/log/ptmd.log
            for more info
```

{{%notice tip%}}

If you encounter errors with the `topology.dot` file, you can use `dot` (included in the Graphviz package) to validate the syntax of the topology file.

Open the topology file with Graphviz to ensure that it is readable and that the file format is correct.

If you edit `topology.dot` file from a Windows system, be sure to double check the file formatting; there might be extra characters that keep the graph from working correctly.

{{%/notice%}}

## Basic Topology Example

This is a basic example DOT file and its corresponding topology diagram. Use the same `topology.dot` file on all switches and do not split the file per device; this allows for easy automation by pushing/pulling the same exact file on each device.

```
graph G {
    "spine1":"swp1" -- "leaf1":"swp1";
    "spine1":"swp2" -- "leaf2":"swp1";
    "spine2":"swp1" -- "leaf1":"swp2";
    "spine2":"swp2" -- "leaf2":"swp2";
    "leaf1":"swp3" -- "leaf2":"swp3";
    "leaf1":"swp4" -- "leaf2":"swp4";
    "leaf1":"swp5s0" -- "server1":"eth1";
    "leaf2":"swp5s0" -- "server2":"eth1";
}
```

## Considerations

### ptmd in Incorrect Failure State while Zebra Interface Is Enabled

When `ptmd` is incorrectly in a failure state and the Zebra interface is enabled, PIF BGP sessions do not establish the route, but the subinterface on top of it does establish routes.

If the subinterface is configured on the physical interface and the physical interface is incorrectly marked as being in a PTM FAIL state, routes on the physical interface are not processed in FRR, but the subinterface is working.

### Cannot Use Commas in PortDescr

If an LLDP neighbor advertises a `PortDescr` that contains commas, `ptmctl -d` splits the string on the commas and misplaces its components in other columns. Do not use commas in your port descriptions.
