The following sections provide the basic configuration needed to use EVPN as the control plane for VXLAN. The steps provided assume you have already configured VXLAN interfaces, attached them to a bridge, and mapped VLANs to VNIs.

{{%notice note%}}

In Cumulus Linux 4.0, MAC learning is disabled and ARP/ND suppression is enabled by default. This is a change from earlier Cumulus Linux releases, where MAC learning is *enabled* and ARP/ND suppression *disabled* by default. Be sure to update any configuration scripts, if necessary.

## Enable EVPN between BGP Neighbors

To enable EVPN between {{<link url="Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP" text="BGP">}} neighbors, add the address family *evpn* to the existing neighbor `address-family` activation command.

For a non-VTEP device that is merely participating in EVPN route exchange, such as a spine switch where the network deployment uses hop-by-hop eBGP or the switch is acting as an iBGP route reflector, activating the interface for the EVPN address family is the fundamental configuration needed in {{<link url="FRRouting" text="FRRouting">}}.

The other BGP neighbor address family specific configurations supported for EVPN are `allowas-in` and `route-reflector-client`.

To configure an EVPN route exchange with a BGP peer, activate the peer or peer group within the EVPN address family. For example:

{{< tabs "TabID26 ">}}

{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65101
cumulus@leaf01:~$ net add bgp router-id 10.10.10.1
cumulus@leaf01:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp51 interface remote-as external
cumulus@leaf01:~$ net add bgp l2vpn evpn neighbor swp51 activate
cumulus@leaf01:~$ net pending
cumulus@leaf01:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "vtysh Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ sudo vtysh

leaf01# configure terminal
leaf01(config)# router bgp 65101
leaf01(config-router)# bgp router-id 10.10.10.1
leaf01(config-router)# neighbor swp51 interface remote-as external
leaf01(config-router)# address-family l2vpn evpn
leaf01(config-router-af)# neighbor swp51 activate
leaf01(config-router-af)# end
leaf01)# write memory
leaf01)# exit
cumulus@leaf01:~$
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

The above commands create the following configuration snippet in the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file.

```
...
router bgp 65101
  bgp router-id 10.10.10.1
  neighbor swp51 interface remote-as external
address-family l2vpn evpn
  neighbor swp51 activate
...
```

The above configuration does not result in BGP knowing about the local VNIs defined on the system and advertising them to peers. This requires additional configuration, described in {{<link url="#advertise-all-vnis" text="Advertise All VNIs">}}, below.

## Advertise All VNIs

FRR is not aware of any local VNIs and MACs, or hosts (neighbors) associated with those VNIs until you enable the BGP control plane for all VNIs configured on the switch by setting the `advertise-all-vni` option.

{{%notice note%}}

This configuration is only needed on leaf switches that are VTEPs. EVPN routes received from a BGP peer are accepted, even without this explicit EVPN configuration. These routes are maintained in the global EVPN routing table. However, they only become effective (imported into the per-VNI routing table and appropriate entries installed in the kernel) when the VNI corresponding to the received route is locally known.

```

The above commands create the following configuration snippet in the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file.

```
...
router bgp 65101

  neighbor swp51 interface remote-as external

neighbor swp51 activate
  advertise-all-vni
...
```

## EVPN and VXLAN Active-active Mode

For EVPN in VXLAN active-active mode, both switches in the MLAG pair establish EVPN peering with other EVPN speakers (for example, with spine switches if using hop-by-hop eBGP) and inform about their locally known VNIs and MACs. When MLAG is active, both switches announce this information with the shared anycast IP address.

For active-active configuration, make sure that:

- The `clagd-vxlan-anycast-ip` and `vxlan-local-tunnelip` parameters are under the loopback stanza on both peers.
- The anycast address is advertised to the routed fabric from both peers.
- The VNIs are configured identically on both peers.
- The peerlink must belong to the bridge.

MLAG synchronizes information between the two switches in the MLAG pair; EVPN does not synchronize.

For type-5 routes in an EVPN *symmetric* configuration with VXLAN active-active mode, Cumulus Linux uses Primary IP Address Advertisement. For information on configuring Primary IP Address Advertisement, see {{<link url="Inter-subnet-Routing#advertise-primary-ip-address-vxlan-active-active-mode" text="Advertise Primary IP Address">}}.

For information about active-active VTEPs and anycast IP behavior, and for failure scenarios, see {{<link url="VXLAN-Active-active-Mode">}}.

## Considerations

- When EVPN is enabled on a VTEP, all locally defined VNIs on that switch and other information (such as MAC addresses) are advertised to EVPN peers. There is no provision to only announce certain VNIs.
- On switches with {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?asic%5B0%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum&asic%5B1%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum_A1" text="Spectrum ASICs">}}, ND suppression only works with the Spectrum-A1 chip.
- ARP suppression is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux. However, in a {{<link url="VXLAN-Active-active-Mode" text="VXLAN active-active">}} configuration, ARPs are sometimes *not* suppressed. This is because the neighbor entries are not synchronized between the two switches operating in active-active mode by a control plane. This has no impact on forwarding.
- You must configure the overlay (tenants) in a specific VRF and separate from the underlay, which resides in the default VRF. Layer 3 VNI mapping for the default VRF is not supported.
- EVPN is not supported when {{<link title="Redistribute Neighbor" >}} is also configured. Enabling both features simultaneously causes instability in IPv4 and IPv6 neighbor entries.
- Cumulus Linux implements a stricter check on a received type-3 route to ensure that it has the PMSI attribute with the replication type set to *ingress-replication* in order to conform to {{<exlink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6514#section-5" text="RFC 6514">}}.
