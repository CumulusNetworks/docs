Cumulus Linux supports Power over Ethernet (PoE) and PoE+, so certain Cumulus Linux switches can supply power from Ethernet switch ports to enabled devices over the Ethernet cables that connect them. PoE is capable of powering devices up to 15W, while PoE+ can power devices up to 30W. Configuration for power negotiation is done over {{<link url="Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol" text="LLDP">}}.

The {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?platform_type%5B0%5D=POE" text="currently supported platforms">}} include:

- Cumulus Express CX-1048-P
- Dell N3048EP-ON
- Delta AG6248C PoE
- EdgeCore AS4610-54P

## PoE Basics

PoE functionality is provided by the `cumulus-poe` package. When a powered device is connected to the switch via an Ethernet cable:

- If the available power is greater than the power required by the connected device, power is supplied to the switch port, and the device powers on
- If available power is less than the power required by the connected device and the switch port's priority is less than the port priority set on all powered ports, power is **not** supplied to the port
- If available power is less than the power required by the connected device and the switch port's priority is greater than the priority of a currently powered port, power is removed from lower priority port(s) and power is supplied to the port
- If the total consumed power exceeds the configured power limit of the power source, low priority ports are turned off. In the case of a tie, the port with the lower port number gets priority

Power is available as follows:

| PSU 1 | PSU 2 | PoE Power Budget |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| 920W  | x     | 750W             |
| x     | 920W  | 750W             |
| 920W  | 920W  | 1650W            |

The AS4610-54P has an LED on the front panel to indicate PoE status:

- Green: The `poed` daemon is running and no errors are detected
- Yellow: One or more errors are detected or the `poed` daemon is not running

{{%notice note%}}

Link state and PoE state are completely independent of each other. When a link is brought down on a particular port using `ip link <port> down`, power on that port is not turned off; however, LLDP negotiation is not possible.

## Configure PoE

You use the `poectl` command utility to configure PoE on a {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?platform_type%5B0%5D=POE" text="switch that supports">}} the feature. You can:

- Enable or disable PoE for a given switch port
- Set a switch port's PoE priority to one of three values: *low*, *high* or *critical*

The PoE configuration resides in `/etc/cumulus/poe.conf`. The file lists all the switch ports, whether PoE is enabled for those ports and the priority for each port.

By default, PoE and PoE+ are enabled on all Ethernet/1G switch ports, and these ports are set with a low priority. Switch ports can have low, high or critical priority.

There is no additional configuration for PoE+.

To change the priority for one or more switch ports, run `poectl -p swp# [low|high|critical]`. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo poectl -p swp1-swp5,swp7 high
```

To disable PoE for one or more ports, run `poectl -d [port_numbers]`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo poectl -d swp1-swp5,swp7
```

To display PoE information for a set of switch ports, run `poectl -i [port_numbers]`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo poectl -i swp10-swp13
Port          Status            Allocated    Priority  PD type      PD class   Voltage   Current    Power
-----   --------------------   -----------   -------- -----------   --------   -------   -------   ---------
swp10   connected              negotiating   low      IEEE802.3at   4          53.5 V     25 mA    3.9 W
swp11   searching              n/a           low      IEEE802.3at   none        0.0 V      0 mA    0.0 W
swp12   connected              n/a           low      IEEE802.3at   2          53.5 V     25 mA    1.4 W
swp13   connected              51.0 W        low      IEEE802.3at   4          53.6 V     72 mA    3.8 W
```

The **Status** can be one of the following:

- **searching:** PoE is enabled but no device has been detected.
- **disabled:** The PoE port has been configured as disabled.
- **connected:** A powered device is connected and receiving power.
- **power-denied:** There is insufficient PoE power available to enable the connected device.

The **Allocated** column displays how much PoE power has been allocated to the port, which can be one of the following:

- **n/a:** No device is connected or the connected device does not support LLDP negotiation.
- **negotiating:** An LLDP-capable device is connected and is negotiating for PoE power.
- **XX.X W:** An LLDP-capable device has negotiated for XX.X watts of power (for example, 51.0 watts for swp13 above).

To see all the PoE information for a switch, run `poectl -s`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ poectl -s
System power:
  Total:      730.0 W
  Used:        11.0 W
  Available:  719.0 W
Connected ports:
  swp11, swp24, swp27, swp48
```

The set commands (priority, enable, disable) either succeed silently or display an error message if the command fails.

The `poectl` command takes the following arguments:

|<div style="width:200px">Argument|Description<img width=500/>|
|-----------------|--------|
|`-h`, `--help`|Show this help message and exit. |
|`-i`, `--port-info`<br>`<port-list>`|Returns detailed information for the specified ports. You can specify a range of ports. For example: `-i swp1-swp5,swp10`.<br>**Note**: On an Edge-Core AS4610-54P switch, the voltage reported by the poectl -i command and measured through a power meter connected to the device varies by 5V. The current and power readings are correct and no difference is seen for them.|
|`-a`, `--all`|Returns PoE status and detailed information for all ports.|
|`-p`, `--priority`<br>`<port-list> <priority>`|Sets priority for the specified ports: low, high, critical.|
|`-d`, `--disable-ports <port-list>`|Disables PoE operation on the specified ports.|
|`-e`, `--enable-ports <port-list>`|Enables PoE operation on the specified ports.|
|`-s`, `--system`|Returns PoE status for the entire switch.|
|`-r`, `--reset <port-list>`|Performs a hardware reset on the specified ports. Use this if one or more ports are stuck in an error state. This does not reset any configuration settings for the specified ports.|
|`-v`, `--version`|Displays version information.|
|`-j`, `--json`|Displays output in JSON format.|
|`--save`|Saves the current configuration. The saved configuration is automatically loaded on system boot.|
|`--load`|Loads and applies the saved configuration.|

## Troubleshooting

You can troubleshoot PoE and PoE+ using the following utilities and files:

- `poectl -s`, as described above.
- The Cumulus Linux `cl-support` script, which includes PoE-related output from `poed.conf`, `syslog`, `poectl --diag-info` and `lldpctl`.
- `lldpcli show neighbors ports <swp> protocol lldp hidden details`
- `tcpdump -v -v -i <swp> ether proto 0x88cc`
- The contents of the PoE/PoE+ `/etc/lldpd.d/poed.conf` configuration file, as described above.

### Verify the Link Is Up

LLDP requires network connectivity, so verify that the link is up.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show interface swp20
    Name    MAC                Speed      MTU  Mode
--  ------  -----------------  -------  -----  ---------
UP  swp20   44:38:39:00:00:04  1G        9216  Access/L2
```

### View LLDP Information Using lldpcli

You can run `lldpcli` to view the LLDP information that has been received on a switch port. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo lldpcli show neighbors ports swp20 protocol lldp hidden details

### View LLDP Information Using tcpdump

### Log poed Events in syslog

The `poed` service logs the following events to `syslog` when:

- A switch provides power to a powered device.
- A device that was receiving power is removed.
- The power available to the switch changes.
- Errors are detected.
