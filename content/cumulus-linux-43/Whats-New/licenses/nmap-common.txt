 The mswin32/IPExport.h file needs to be removed because it is not licensed
 under the terms of a DFSG compatible license.  Other libraries shipped with
 nmap have been removed as well, specifically: liblinear, liblua, libpcap,
 libpcre, libssh2, and libz.  The Debian package depends on the respective
 packages of these libraries.

License: nmap-GPL-2
 This program is free software; you may redistribute and/or modify it
 under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
 Free Software Foundation; Version 2 ("GPL"), BUT ONLY WITH ALL OF THE
 CLARIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN.  This guarantees your
 right to use, modify, and redistribute this software under certain
 conditions.  If you wish to embed Nmap technology into proprietary
 software, we sell alternative licenses (contact sales@nmap.com).
 Dozens of software vendors already license Nmap technology such as
 host discovery, port scanning, OS detection, version detection, and
 the Nmap Scripting Engine.
 .
 Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derivative works",
 yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid
 misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law
 allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a
 derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the
 following with any software or content covered by this license
 ("Covered Software"):
 .
 - Integrates source code from Covered Software.
 - Reads or includes copyrighted data files, such as Nmap's nmap-os-db
   or nmap-service-probes.
 - Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the
   results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which
   will execute anything you tell them to).
 - Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The
   installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.
   Including Nmap with other software in compressed or archival form
   does not trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source
   decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for no
   charge.  For the purposes of this license, an installer is considered
   to include Covered Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of
   Covered Software from another source during runtime (such as by
   downloading it from the Internet).
 - Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the
   above.
 - Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.
 .
 This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation
 of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret
 the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to
 the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of
 these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,
 particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing
 source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.
 .
 As another special exception to the GPL terms, the Nmap Project grants
 permission to link the code of this program with any version of the
 OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that
 listed in the included docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute
 linked combinations including the two.
 .
 The Nmap Project has permission to redistribute Npcap, a packet
 capturing driver and library for the Microsoft Windows platform.
 Npcap is a separate work with it's own license rather than this Nmap
 license.  Since the Npcap license does not permit redistribution
 without special permission, our Nmap Windows binary packages which
 contain Npcap may not be redistributed without special permission.
 .
 Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,
 must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including
 obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of
 the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be
 allowed.  All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as
 including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.
 .
 Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered
 Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL
 software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must
 be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open
 source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of
 Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source
 software.  Please contact fyodor@nmap.org with any such requests.
 Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source software into
 Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders.
 .
 If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using
 Nmap in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also
 offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary
 applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens
 of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well
 as providing for priority support and updates.  They also fund the
 continued development of Nmap.  Please email sales@nmap.com for further
 information.
 .
 If you have received a written license agreement or contract for
 Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use
 and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.
 .
 Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a
 right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it.
 This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.
 .
 Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,
 and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes
 to the dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the
 main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the
 Insecure.Org development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap
 source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify
 otherwise) that you are offering the Nmap Project the unlimited,
 non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  Nmap
 will always be available Open Source, but this is important because
 the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for
 other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also
 occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed above.
 If you wish to specify special license conditions of your
 contributions, just say so when you send them.
