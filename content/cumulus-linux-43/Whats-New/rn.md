The proper syntax is to use multiple route map clauses, each matching a single interface, instead of a single clause matching multiple interfaces. <br />For example, this command is incorrect: <br /><pre> <br />net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9-10 <br /></pre> <br />These commands are correct: <br /><pre> <br />net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 25 match interface swp9 <br />net add routing route-map Proxy-ARP permit 30 match interface swp10 <br /></pre> <br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.15, 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

The iptables rule for redirection does differentiate between BFD and non-BFD VXLAN inner packets because the service node sends all frames with its own IP address as the tunnel source IP address. The VXLAN encapsulated BUM packets do not get forwarded to the CPU and do not go through the iptable redirection rule; only VXLAN encapsulated BFD packets get forwarded to the CPU due to the inner MAC DA lookup in hardware. <br />  | 3.7.0-3.7.15, 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in <code>No buffer space available</code> error messages on protocol sockets.<br />When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues.

If you are using bond-lacp-bypass-allow or balance-xor mode, the host might continue to send traffic. This traffic will be dropped because although the bond slaves are UP, they are not members of the bridge.<br />To work around this issue, use the <code>sudo ifdown <bondname></code> command. | 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

Archiving the directory tree with <code>tar</code>, <code>zip</code>, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use <code>scp -r</code> altogether.

The iptables rule for redirection does differentiate between BFD and non-BFD VXLAN inner packets because the service node sends all frames with its own IP address as the tunnel source IP address. The VXLAN encapsulated BUM packets do not get forwarded to the CPU and do not go through the iptable redirection rule; only VXLAN encapsulated BFD packets get forwarded to the CPU due to the inner MAC DA lookup in hardware. <br />  | 3.7.0-3.7.15, 4.0.0-4.4.0 | |

This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in <code>No buffer space available</code> error messages on protocol sockets.<br />When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues.

This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.<br />This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.<br />To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:<br /><pre><br />bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master<br />bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master &#91; static \| dynamic &#93;<br /></pre><br />If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address.
