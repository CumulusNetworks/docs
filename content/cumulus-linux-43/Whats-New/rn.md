| <a name="CM-33258"></a> [CM-33258](#CM-33258) <a name="CM-33258"></a> | Cumulus Linux does not support bond members at 200G or greater. | 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33237"></a> [CM-33237](#CM-33237) <a name="CM-33237"></a> | CVE-2020-36221, CVE-2020-36222, CVE-2020-36223, CVE-2020-36224, CVE-2020-36225, CVE-2020-36226, CVE-2020-36227, CVE-2020-36228, CVE-2020-36229, CVE-2020-36230:  Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. An unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash, infinite loops) via specially crafted packets.<br/>Vulnerable: <= 2.4.47+dfsg-3+deb10u4<br/>Fixed: 2.4.47+dfsg-3+deb10u5 | 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33196"></a> [CM-33196](#CM-33196) <a name="CM-33196"></a> | If you use NCLU to configure an ACL for eth0, you can't designate it as an INPUT rule; the rule is automatically created as a FORWARD rule in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/50_nclu_acl.rules` file.<br/>To work around this issue, manually create an ACL in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/` file with "-A INPUT -i eth0". | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33185"></a> [CM-33185](#CM-33185) <a name="CM-33185"></a> | In vtysh you can enable and disable debugs from either exec mode or global configuration mode (config t). When disabling OSPF debugs from exec mode, the debug is disabled at runtime but left in the running-configuration.<br/>To work around this issue, disable OSPF debugs from global configuration mode (config t). | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33167"></a> [CM-33167](#CM-33167) <a name="CM-33167"></a> | On the Mellanox SN4700 switch, if you use the CREDO CABLE with a 4x100 configuration, the system experiences issues accessing the ASIC Thermal sensors. | 4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33112"></a> [CM-33112](#CM-33112) <a name="CM-33112"></a> | The MTU size configured under a layer 2 VNI interface is not applied for VXLAN traffic. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33050"></a> [CM-33050](#CM-33050) <a name="CM-33050"></a> | The NCLU `net del vrf` command does not delete a numbered VRF. For example:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;leaf01:~$ net del vrf 55<br />ERROR: Command not found<br /></pre><br /> | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33049"></a> [CM-33049](#CM-33049) <a name="CM-33049"></a> | You cannot set the time zone can with NCLU commands. | 4.1.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33035"></a> [CM-33035](#CM-33035) <a name="CM-33035"></a> | EAP-TLS fail on wired connections when the reachability to the RADIUS server does not use the eth0 (mgmt) VRF interface. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-33032"></a> [CM-33032](#CM-33032) <a name="CM-33032"></a> | On Edgecore AS4610 switches, the historic CPU usage displayed in `/run/sysmonitor/history` is sometimes shown as a negative value.  | 3.7.12-3.7.14, 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32953"></a> [CM-32953](#CM-32953) <a name="CM-32953"></a> | On Mellanox switches, you can't ping the SVI of the MLAG peer over the peer link after the packet is VXLAN decapsulated. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32951"></a> [CM-32951](#CM-32951) <a name="CM-32951"></a> | When the EVPN primary IP address and advertise SVI IP address options are both configured, the SVI ARP is not forwarded between MLAG switches. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32914"></a> [CM-32914](#CM-32914) <a name="CM-32914"></a> | On Mellanox switches, egress ACLs with VLAN keys do not filter layer 2 multicast or broadcast traffic. | 4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32861"></a> [CM-32861](#CM-32861) <a name="CM-32861"></a> | The NCLU `net del bgp neighbor` command does not delete the neighbor and displays an error similar to the following:<br /><pre>ERROR: --- /run/nclu/frr/frr.conf.scratchpad.baseline   2021-01-04 17:23:59.250463331 +0000<br />+++ /run/nclu/frr/frr.conf.scratchpad    2021-01-04 17:25:59.213673980 +0000<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, use the FRR command to delete a neighbor. | 4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32786"></a> [CM-32786](#CM-32786) <a name="CM-32786"></a> | The `net show configuration commands` command incorrectly displays the NCLU syntax to disable IPv6 forwarding on interfaces. For example:<br /><pre># net show configuration commands<br />net add vlan 1 ip6-forward off <br /></pre><br />The correct NCLU command to disable IPv6 forwarding is `net add vlan 1 ipv6 forward off` (without the hyphen). | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32612"></a> [CM-32612](#CM-32612) <a name="CM-32612"></a> | If you try to enable BGP graceful restart when it is already enabled, you see an error similar to the following in the `frr.log` file:<br /><pre>2020-12-07T19:20:26.004333+00:00 cumulus bgpd&#91;4954&#93;: VRF default: Handle GR command GLOBAL_GR_CMD, current GR state GLOBAL_GR, new GR state GLOBAL_INVALID<br /></pre><br />This error has no functional impact. | 4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32588"></a> [CM-32588](#CM-32588) <a name="CM-32588"></a> | On the Mellanox SN2700 and SN2410 switch, the MTEF-PSF-AC-I and MTEF-PSR-AC-I PSUs incorrectly show 460W instead of the correct 550W. This is a cosmetic issue that does not affect the actual wattage or throughput of the power supplies. | 4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32545"></a> [CM-32545](#CM-32545) <a name="CM-32545"></a> | If the FRR and MSTP processes go down, an SNMP TRAP is not generated even with the following configuration in the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file. <br /><pre>proc watchfrr<br />proc mstpd<br />monitor -I -r 1 -o prNames.5 -o prErrMessage.5 “Process FRRis down!!!” PrErrorFlag.5 != 0<br />monitor -I -r 1 -o prNames.5 -o prErrMessage.5 “Process FRR is up!!!” PrErrorFlag.5 = 0<br />monitor -I -r 1  -o prNames.3 -o prErrMessage.3  "Process mstpd is down!!!!" prErrorFlag.3 != 0<br />monitor -I -r 1  -o prNames.3 -o prErrMessage.3  "Process mstpd is up!!!!" prErrorFlag.3 = 0<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.12-3.7.14, 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32516"></a> [CM-32516](#CM-32516) <a name="CM-32516"></a> | When using NCLU to add new BGP neighbors to existing configurations, the existence of address-family statements are ignored and the neighbors are added at the end of these lines. This might cause a problem if you try to activate these new neighbors in any of the existing address-family configurations.<br/>To work around this issue, configure the new BGP neighbors with vtysh. | 3.7.14, 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32416"></a> [CM-32416](#CM-32416) <a name="CM-32416"></a> | The `ethtool` utility doesn't contain the latest values, as a result the `Revision Compliance` field shows `Unallocated`.  | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32296"></a> [CM-32296](#CM-32296) <a name="CM-32296"></a> | If the RMAC of a layer 3 SVI changes, the `show vrf vni` command is not updated with the new value. However, the new RMAC is seen in the `show evpn vni` command and is present on self-originated EVPN routes. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32286"></a> [CM-32286](#CM-32286) <a name="CM-32286"></a> | On the Mellanox SN3700C switch, PIM multicast packets are duplicated at the egress VTEP. | 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32274"></a> [CM-32274](#CM-32274) <a name="CM-32274"></a> | If you apply an outbound route map to a BGP peer that uses `set as-path prepend last-as`, advertised locally-originated routes have the ASN of the peer prepended to the AS path.<br/>This might trigger AS path loop prevention on the peer, where the peer ignores locally-originated prefixes. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32217"></a> [CM-32217](#CM-32217) <a name="CM-32217"></a> | The IP address specified in the `ip pim use-source` command configured on the loopback interface should be inherited by unnumbered interfaces during their Primary IP address selection process.  If `ip pim use-source` is configured on the loopback after an unnumbered interface has already selected their Primary IP address, the unnumbered interface does not update its Primary IP address to be the new use-source value until after there is a netlink update for that interface.<br/>To work around this issue, configure `ip pim use-source` on each unnumbered interface directly or ensure `ip pim use-source` is applied to the loopback before other unnumbered interfaces are enabled for PIM. | 3.7.13-3.7.14, 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32169"></a> [CM-32169](#CM-32169) <a name="CM-32169"></a> | OpenSSH is vulnerable to CVE-2020-14145, as described in <a href="https://www.fzi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/2020-06-26-FSA-2020-2.pdf" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.fzi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/2020-06-26-FSA-2020-2.pdf</a>.  <br/>This is an information leak in algorithm negotiation that can allow man-in-the-middle attacks on initial connection attempts without a previously stored server host key on the client. If desired, mitigation using UpdateHostKeys and HostKeyAlgorithms is also given in that paper. | 3.0.0-3.7.14, 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32144"></a> [CM-32144](#CM-32144) <a name="CM-32144"></a> | On switches with the Maverick ASIC, control traffic is dropped due to receive buffering. | 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32112"></a> [CM-32112](#CM-32112) <a name="CM-32112"></a> | On the ARM platform, NTP peer associations slowly increase to larger offsets (~500ms). | 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32068"></a> [CM-32068](#CM-32068) <a name="CM-32068"></a> | Kernel routes added by `iproute2` are missing in FRR after an interface flap.<br/>To work around this issue, configure a static route in FRR. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-32055"></a> [CM-32055](#CM-32055) <a name="CM-32055"></a> | During a graceful restart of a peer router, if the link between the local system (Helper) and the restarting router flaps, the stale routes announced by the restarting router are no longer used for forwarding by the Helper router even though they remain in the BGP RIB. | 4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31962"></a> [CM-31962](#CM-31962) <a name="CM-31962"></a> | In a VRRP configuration, BGP unnumbered sessions for VRFs fail to establish after a networking restart. | 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31928"></a> [CM-31928](#CM-31928) <a name="CM-31928"></a> | On the Mellanox SN3700C switch, `hwmon` fails to collect information and show errors similar to the following:<br /><pre>2020-10-01T17:48:09.558200+09:00 &#91;sn3700c1&#93;&#91;kernel&#93;&#91;err&#93; &#91;25666.121068&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br />2020-10-01T17:48:09.558200+09:00 &#91;sn3700c1&#93;&#91;kernel&#93;&#91;err&#93; &#91;25666.127069&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=query)<br />2020-10-01T17:48:10.554707+09:00 &#91;sn3700c2&#93;&#91;kernel&#93;&#91;err&#93; &#91;25160.069404&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br />2020-10-01T17:48:10.554707+09:00 &#91;sn3700c2&#93;&#91;kernel&#93;&#91;err&#93; &#91;25160.075393&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900f(mtbr),type=query)<br />2020-10-01T17:48:10.554707+09:00 &#91;sn3700c2&#93;&#91;kernel&#93;&#91;err&#93; &#91;25160.084265&#93; hwmon hwmon7: Failed to query module temperature sensor<br /></pre><br /> | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31921"></a> [CM-31921](#CM-31921) <a name="CM-31921"></a> | The NCLU command to enable bridge learning fails.<br/>As a work around, enable bridge learning in the `/etc/network/interface` file. For example:<br /><pre>auto vni-30<br />iface vni-30<br />    vxlan-id 30<br />    bridge-access 30<br />    bridge-arp-nd-suppress on<br />    bridge-learning on<br />    vxlan-local-tunnelip 10.10.10.1<br />    mstpctl-bpduguard yes<br />    mstpctl-portbpdufilter yes<br />    mtu 9166<br /></pre><br /> | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31917"></a> [CM-31917](#CM-31917) <a name="CM-31917"></a> | MLAG packets received on the peer link are dropped instead of routed. | 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31904"></a> [CM-31904](#CM-31904) <a name="CM-31904"></a> | The output of the `net show commit` command does not show the last commit or the specified commit number but is empty instead. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31605"></a> [CM-31605](#CM-31605) <a name="CM-31605"></a> | When you configure an SNMPv3 user with the `net-snmp-config` configuration command from the `libsnmp-dev` package, you get an error message similar to the one below:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:mgmt-vrf:~$ sudo net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user -a shaauthpass -x aesprivpass -A SHA -X AES userSHAwithAES<br />adding the following line to /var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf:           <br />   createUser userSHAwithAES SHA "shaauthpass" AES "aesprivpass"       <br />adding the following line to /snmp/snmpd.conf:                           <br />   rwuser userSHAwithAES                                           <br />touch: cannot touch ‘/snmp/snmpd.conf’: No such file or directory<br />/usr/bin/net-snmp-create-v3-user: 144: /usr/bin/net-snmp-create-v3-user: cannot create /snmp/snmpd.conf: Directory nonexistent<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, use the NCLU command to configure SNMPv3 user parameters; for example:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:mgmt-vrf:~$ net add snmp-server username user999 auth-md5 user999password encrypt-des user999encryption<br /></pre><br />Alternatively, directly edit the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file as described in the documentation. | 3.7.13-3.7.14, 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31418"></a> [CM-31418](#CM-31418) <a name="CM-31418"></a> | The default NTP configuration is to use eth0 as the NTP source interfaces. In Cumulus Linux releases where eth0 is in the mgmt VRF by default, the ntp service automatically runs in the management VRF. <br/>It is not recommended to run NTP with a source interface other than eth0 as this can be a security vulnerability.<br/>Changing the NTP source interface name with NCLU to a non-management VRF interface<br/>might result in NTP not functioning since the ntp service is still running in the mgmt VRF. | 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31414"></a> [CM-31414](#CM-31414) <a name="CM-31414"></a> | On the Mellanox SN4700 switch, 8x50G port breakout is not supported currently. | 4.2.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31404"></a> [CM-31404](#CM-31404) <a name="CM-31404"></a> | On the Delta AG7648 switch, the System LED and the Power LED do not display correctly. | 3.7.13-3.7.14, 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31327"></a> [CM-31327](#CM-31327) <a name="CM-31327"></a> | After you manually edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to change or remove a VRF for a given DNS server, `ifreload` does not remove IP rules created for DNS servers in the VRF. <br/>To work around this issue, run the `net add/del dns nameserver vrf <name>` command to force the DNS configuration. | 3.7.13-3.7.14, 4.1.1-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31300"></a> [CM-31300](#CM-31300) <a name="CM-31300"></a> | If a neighbour contains a special character in PortID for LLDP, the `net show interface` command does not display the LLDP information or the command might fail. | 3.7.10-3.7.14, 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-31111"></a> [CM-31111](#CM-31111) <a name="CM-31111"></a> | On the EdgeCore AS4610 switch, the eth0 interface remains down when physically connected to a 1G interface.<br/>To work around this issue, configure the link speed to 1000 and set auto-negotiation on for the eth0 interface, then flap eth0 with the `ip link set eth0 down/up` command to bring up the port. | 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30987"></a> [CM-30987](#CM-30987) <a name="CM-30987"></a> | On the Mellanox switch, RoCE with PFC configuration is not applied to all ports in hardware when a range is used in the `traffic.conf` file.<br/>To work around this issue, use NCLU to configure RoCE with PFC or list individual ports in the `traffic.conf` file. | 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30879"></a> [CM-30879](#CM-30879) <a name="CM-30879"></a> | NCLU restarts FRR when removing a BGP VRF IPv4 aggregate-address command. | 3.7.12-3.7.14, 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30863"></a> [CM-30863](#CM-30863) <a name="CM-30863"></a> | OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>-The user is authorized to `scp` but not `ssh` (based on the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses `scp -r` to copy over to the target computer.<br/>Be aware that restricting users to `scp` by using the `command` option in the `authorized_keys` file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>If you want to use `scp -r` to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with `tar`, `zip`, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use `scp -r` altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides `sftp`, which you can use instead of `scp` to copy files.<br/>To disable scp completely, use `/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp` . | 3.0.0-3.7.14, 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30473"></a> [CM-30473](#CM-30473) <a name="CM-30473"></a> | If you modify an interface name, then reuse the previous interface name for a different VLAN, the `ifreload -a` command generates an error similar to the following:<br /><pre>warning: <interface-name>: interface not recognized - please check interface configuration<br /></pre><br /> | 4.1.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30422"></a> [CM-30422](#CM-30422) <a name="CM-30422"></a> | When you configure a bridge in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file, then try to reconfigure the bridge to be a VRF interface with the same name, `ifreload`/`ifup` commands fail with an `invalid table id` or `unable to get vrf table id` error. | 3.7.12-3.7.14, 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30414"></a> [CM-30414](#CM-30414) <a name="CM-30414"></a> | If you toggle VRRP priority values between VRRP routers, then run a `switchd` restart, a few IPv6 VRRP instances might not converge. As a result, both the VRRP routers act as <em>master</em> routers for the impacted IPv6 VRRP instances. IPv4 VRRP instances are not affected.<br/>To work around this issue, remove, then add the VRRP configuration with NCLU commands or vtysh in FRR. | 3.7.13-3.7.14, 4.2.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30312"></a> [CM-30312](#CM-30312) <a name="CM-30312"></a> | When TACACS+ is configured and the management VRF is enabled, users with privilege level 13 are prevented from running `ip` and `cat` commands. | 4.0.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30296"></a> [CM-30296](#CM-30296) <a name="CM-30296"></a> | The `net show configuration` command provides the wrong `net add` command for ACL under the VLAN interface. | 3.7.12-3.7.14, 4.1.0-4.3.0 | |
| <a name="CM-30280"></a> [CM-30280](#CM-30280) <a name="CM-30280"></a> | On a Mellanox SN2010 switch, the Locator LED is on after you upgrade Cumulus Linux. | 4.1.0-4.3.0 | |
