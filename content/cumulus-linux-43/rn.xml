<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

<td>At a high CPU transmit traffic rate (for example, if there is unexpected CPU generated flooding or replication in software), when the ASIC packet driver cannot keep up with the transmit rate because there are no free DMA buffers, it can back pressure by suspending the switch port transmit queues. This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in {{No buffer space available}} error messages on protocol sockets.
When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a {{switchd}} restart.</td>

<td>CVE-2023-38408: The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.
Mitigation: Do not use ssh-agent forwarding (the man page for ssh_config says that "agent forwarding should be enabled with caution"), or start the ssh-agent program with the -P option to allow only specific PKCS#11 libraries (or none with -P '').

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.

The VXLAN encapsulated BUM packets do not get forwarded to the CPU and do not go through the iptable redirection rule; only VXLAN encapsulated BFD packets get forwarded to the CPU due to the inner MAC DA lookup in hardware.

<td>Cumulus Linux 4.3.1 is available for Broadcom switches only. Do not upgrade a Mellanox switch to Cumulus Linux 4.3.1.

On Broadcom switches, upgrading from Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 to {{CumulusLinux-4-latest}} with {{apt update}} and {{apt upgrade}} downloads and installs only the {{cumulus-newpackages-bcm}} package. This changes {{CumulusLinux-4-latest}} in the {{/etc/apt/sources.list}} to {{CumulusLinux-4-latest-BCM}} after which, when you run {{apt update}} and {{apt upgrade}}, the switch upgrades to Cumulus Linux 4.3.1.

On Broadcom switches, upgrading from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 to 4.2.1 to {{CumulusLinux-4-latest}}  with {{apt update}} and {{apt upgrade}} will upgrade to CumulusLinux 4.3.0, with {{CumulusLinux-4-latest-BCM}} listed in {{/etc/apt/sources.list}}.  Doing {{apt update}} and {{apt upgrade}} again will then upgrade the switch to Cumulus Linux 4.3.1.

For Mellanox switches, the above procedure does not upgrade to Cumulus Linux 4.3.1. However, if you start the upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 to 4.2.1, the switch might upgrade to Cumulus Linux 4.3.0.</td>

<td>The following vulnerabilities have been announced in the openssl packages:
CVE-2021-23840: Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
CVE-2021-23841: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
CVE-2019-1551: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
CVE-2021-23841: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
CVE-2019-1551: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files.

<td>When you configure BGP {{aggregate-address summary-only}} and any component route within the summary updates, all component routes within the summary update in the RIB on the device advertising the summary. This condition might result in increased CPU usage.

To workaround this issue, remove the {{aggregate-address summary-only}} configuration, add a static route to Null0 for the prefix, and configure an outbound route map to restrict anything more specific than the desired prefix from being advertised. For example: 

Before:

address-family ipv4 unicast
   aggregate-address 10.10.0.0/16 summary-only
   redistribute connected


After:

ip route 10.10.0.0/16 Null0
   !

   redistribute connected route-map DENY-COMPONENTS
   redistribute static
    exit-address-family

   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS deny 10
    match ip address prefix-list NO-COMPONENTS
   !
   route-map DENY-COMPONENTS permit 20

This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]

If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

<td>When a multipath route that contains an EVPN path exists together with an IPv4 BGP path in the VRF, the RMAC to VTEP binding is incorrect. This invalid entry occurs because Cumulus Linux treats IPv4 routes received over the eBGP IPv4 peering incorrectly in the VRF.
To work around this issue, remove the unnecessary eBGP IPv4 peering.</td>

<td>If you configure the aggregate-address &lt;address&gt; summary-only option before injecting a component of the same aggregate into the BGP table with the {{network}} or {{redistribute}} command, when you remove the {{aggregate-address}} configuration, the component stays suppressed; it is not advertised to peers. For example:
Existing configuration:

router bgp 1
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only
 exit-address-family

If you add {{network 50.0.0.1/32}}, you see the following (expected) BGP table entries:

Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, &gt; best, = multipath,
              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed
Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete

s&gt; 50.0.0.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i

Removing {{aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only}} at this point results in the following (unexpected) BGP table entry:

Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, &gt; best, = multipath,
              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed
Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete

s&gt; 50.0.0.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i

<td>Hardware platforms using the Intel D-1500 CPU series might reboot unexpectedly.
To work around this issue, contact your hardware vendor to inquire if a new version of BIOS with a microcode fix is available or manually disable CPU C-states in the kernel as outlined below.
To permanently disable C-states using a kernel boot parameter:
1. Edit {{/etc/default/grub}} to add the argument {{processor.max_cstate=0}} to the variable {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}}. For example, if {{/etc/default/grub}} file contains the line {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off"}}, change it to {{GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cl_platform=accton_as7726_32x console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 intel_iommu=off pcie_aspm=off processor.max_cstate=0"}}
2. Run {{sudo update-grub}}.
3. Reboot the system with {{sudo reboot}}.
To disable cstates in realtime on the current system, which does not persist through a reboot:
1. Confirm that the libpci3 package is installed. Run {{dpkg-query -l libpci3}} and confirm the following line is displayed:
{{ii  libpci3:amd64      1:3.2.1-3      amd64          Linux PCI Utilities (shared library)}}
The first field above should read {{ii}}. If not, install the libpci3 package by running {{sudo apt upgrade;sudo apt install libpci3}}.
2. Disable C-states by running the command {{./cpupower idle-set -d 2}}.
C-states are disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 4.3.0 and later.</td>
