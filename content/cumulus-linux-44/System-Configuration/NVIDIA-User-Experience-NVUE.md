NVUE is an object-oriented, schema driven model of a complete Cumulus Linux system (hardware and software) providing a robust API that allows for multiple interfaces to both view (show) and configure (set and unset) any element within a system running the NVUE software. The NVUE command line interface (CLI) and the REST API leverage the same API to interface with Cumulus Linux.
<!-- vale off -->
NVUE follows a declarative model, removing context-specific commands and settings. It is structured as a *big tree* that represents the entire state of a Cumulus Linux instance. At the base of the tree are high level branches representing objects, such as *router* and *interface*. Under each of these branches are further branches. As you navigate through the tree, you gain a more specific context. At the leaves of the tree are actual attributes, represented as key-value pairs. The path through the tree is similar to a filesystem path.

## Start the NVUE Service

Cumulus Linux installs NVUE by default but disables the NVUE service. To run NVUE commands, you must enable and start the NVUE service (`nvued`):

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl enable nvued
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl start nvued
```

{{%notice info%}}
Do not mix NVUE and NCLU commands to configure the switch; use either the NCLU CLI or the NVUE CLI.
{{%/notice%}}

## NVUE REST API

To access the NVUE API, run these commands on the switch:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-{available,enabled}/nvue.conf
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo sed -i 's/listen localhost:8765 ssl;/listen \[::\]:8765 ipv6only=off ssl;/g' /etc/nginx/sites-available/nvue.conf
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

You can run the cURL commands from the command line. Use the username and password for the switch. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ curl  -u 'cumulus:cumulus' --insecure https://127.0.0.1:8765/cue_v1/interface
{
  "eth0": {
    "ip": {
      "address": {
        "192.168.200.12/24": {}
      }
    },
    "link": {
      "mtu": 1500,
      "state": {
        "up": {}
      },
      "stats": {
        "carrier-transitions": 2,
        "in-bytes": 184151,
        "in-drops": 0,
        "in-errors": 0,
        "in-pkts": 2371,
        "out-bytes": 117506,
        "out-drops": 0,
        "out-errors": 0,
        "out-pkts": 762
      }
...
```

### Set a Configuration Change

To make a configuration change with the NVUE API:

1. Create a new revision ID using a POST:

   ```
   $ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' --insecure -X POST https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/revision
   {
     "changeset/cumulus/2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K": {
       "state": "pending",
       "transition": {
         "issue": {},
         "progress": ""
       }
     }
   }

   ```

2. Record the revision ID. In the above example, the revision ID is `"changeset/cumulus/2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K"`.

3. Make the change using a PATCH and link it to the revision ID:

   ```
   $ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' -d '{"99.99.99.99/32": {}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --insecure -X PATCH https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/interface/lo/ip/address?rev=changeset/cumulus/2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K
   {
     "99.99.99.99/32": {}
   }
   ```

4. Apply the changes using a PATCH to the revision changeset. You must use the full key value for the revision and replace `/`​ with `%2F`​ in the list:

   ```
   $ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' -d '{"state":"apply"}' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' --insecure -X PATCH https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/revision/changeset%2Fcumulus%2F2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K
   {
     "state": "apply",
     "transition": {
       "issue": {},
       "progress": ""
     }
   }
   ```

5. Review the status of the apply and the configuration:

   ```
   cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' --insecure https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/revision/changeset%2Fcumulus%2F2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K
   {
     "state": "applied",
     "transition": {
       "issue": {},
       "progress": ""
     }
   }
   ```

   ```
   $ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' --insecure https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/interface/lo/ip/address
   {
     "127.0.0.1/8": {},
     "99.99.99.99/32": {},
     "::1/128": {}
   }
   ```

### Unset a Configuration Change

To unset a change, use the `null` value to the key. For example, to delete `vlan100` from a switch, use the following syntax:

```
$ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' -d '{"vlan100":null}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --insecure -X PATCH https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/interface?rev=changeset/cumulus/2021-11-29_11.46.23_6C7T
```

When you unset a change, you must still use the `PATCH` action. The value indicates removal of the entry. The data is `{"vlan100":null}` with the PATCH action.

### Troubleshoot Configuration Changes

When a configuration change fails, you see an error in the change request.

#### Configuration Fails Because of a Dependency

If you stage a configuration but it fails because of a dependency, the failure shows the reason. In the following example, the configuration change fails because the BGP router ID is not set:

```
$ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' --insecure https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/revision/changeset%2Fcumulus%2F2021-11-02_13.57.25_5Z1H
{
  "state": "invalid",
  "transition": {
    "issue": {
      "0": {
        "code": "config_invalid",
        "data": {
          "location": "router.bgp.enable",
          "reason": "BGP requires router-id to be set globally or in the VRF.\n"
        },
        "message": "Config invalid at router.bgp.enable: BGP requires router-id to be set globally or in the VRF.\n",
        "severity": "error"
      }
    },
    "progress": "Invalid config"
  }
}
```

The staged configuration is missing `router-id`:

```
$ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' --insecure https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/vrf/default/router/bgp?rev=changeset%2Fcumulus%2F2021-11-02_13.57.25_5Z1H
{
  "autonomous-system": 65999,
  "enable": "on"
}
```

#### Configuration Apply Fails with Warnings

In some cases, such as the first push with NVUE or if you change a file manually instead of using NVUE, you see a warning prompt and the apply fails:

```
$ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' --insecure -X GET https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/revision/changeset%2Fcumulus%2F2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K
{
  "changeset/cumulus/2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K": {
    "state": "ays_fail",
    "transition": {
      "issue": {
        "0": {
          "code": "client_timeout",
          "data": {},
          "message": "Timeout while waiting for client response",
          "severity": "error"
        }
      },
      "progress": "Aborted apply after warnings"
    }
  }
```

To resolve this issue, include `"auto-prompt":{"ays": "ays_yes"}` to the configuration apply:

```
$ curl -u 'cumulus:cumulus' -d '{"state":"apply","auto-prompt":{"ays": "ays_yes"}}' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' --insecure -X PATCH https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/revision/changeset%2Fcumulus%2F2021-11-02_16.09.18_5Z1K
```

For information about using the NVUE API, refer to the {{<mib_link url="cumulus-linux-44/api/index.html" text="NVUE API documentation.">}}

## NVUE CLI

The NVUE CLI has a flat structure as opposed to a modal structure. This means that you can run all commands from the primary prompt instead of only in a specific mode.

{{%notice note%}}
The NVUE commands and outputs in this documentation are subject to change.
{{%/notice%}}

### Command Syntax

NVUE commands all begin with `nv` and fall into one of three syntax categories:
- Configuration (`nv set` and ` nv unset`)
- Monitoring (`nv show`)
- Configuration management (`nv config`).

### Command Completion
<!-- vale off -->
As you enter commands, you can get help with the valid keywords or options using the Tab key. For example, using Tab completion with `nv set` displays the possible options for the command, and returns you to the command prompt to complete the command.
<!-- vale on -->
```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set <<press Tab>>
acl        evpn       mlag       platform   router     system
bridge     interface  nve        qos        service    vrf

cumulus@switch:~$ nv set
```

### Command Help
<!-- vale off -->
As you enter commands, you can get help with command syntax by entering `-h` or `--help` at various points within a command entry. For example, to find out what options are available for `nv set interface`, enter `nv set interface -h` or `nv set interface --help`.
<!-- vale on -->
```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface -h
Usage:
  nv set interface [options] <interface-id> ...

Description:
  Interfaces

Identifiers:
  <interface-id>    Interface

General Options:
  -h, --help        Show help.
```

### Command List

You can list all the NVUE commands by running `nv list-commands`. See {{<link url="#list-all-nvue-commands" text="List All NVUE Commands">}} below.

### Command History
<!-- vale off -->
At the command prompt, press the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to move back and forth through the list of commands you entered. When you find a given command, you can run the command by pressing Enter. Optionally, you can modify the command before you run it.
<!-- vale on -->
## Command Categories

The NVUE CLI has a flat structure; however, the commands are in three functional categories:

- Configuration
- Monitoring
- Configuration Management

### Configuration Commands

The NVUE configuration commands modify switch configuration. You can set and unset configuration options.
<!-- vale off -->
The `nv set` and `nv unset` commands are in the following categories. Each command group includes subcommands. Use command completion (Tab key) to list the subcommands.
<!-- vale on -->
| <div style="width:300px">Command Group | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `nv set acl`<br>`nv unset acl` | Configures ACLs in Cumulus Linux.|
| `nv set bridge`<br>`nv unset bridge` | Configures a bridge domain. This is where you configure the bridge type (such as VLAN-aware), 802.1Q encapsulation, the STP state and priority, and the VLANs in the bridge domain. |
| `nv set evpn`<br>`nv unset evpn` | Configures EVPN. This is where you enable and disable the EVPN control plane, and set EVPN route advertise options, default gateway configuration for centralized routing, multihoming, and duplicate address detection options. |
| `nv set interface <interface-id>`<br>`nv unset interface <interface-id>` | Configures the switch interfaces. Use this command to configure bond interfaces, bridge interfaces, interface IP addresses, VLAN IDs, and links (MTU, FEC, speed, duplex, and so on).|
| `nv set mlag`<br>`nv unset mlag` | Configures MLAG. This is where you configure the backup IP address or interface, MLAG system MAC address, peer IP address, MLAG priority, and the delay before bonds come up. |
| `nv set nve`<br>`nv unset nve` | Configures network virtualization (VXLAN) settings. This is where you configure the UDP port for VXLAN frames, control dynamic MAC learning over VXLAN tunnels, enable and disable ARP/ND suppression, and configure how Cumulus Linux handles BUM traffic in the overlay.|
| `nv set platform`<br>`nv unset platform` | Configures the hostname of the switch and sets how configuration apply operations work (which files to ignore and which files to overwrite). See {{<link title="#configure-nvue-to-ignore-linux-files" text="Configure NVUE to Ignore Linux Files">}}. |
| `nv set qos`<br>`nv unset qos` | Configures QoS RoCE. |
| `nv set router`<br>`nv unset router` | Configures router policies (prefix list rules and route maps), global BGP options (enable and disable BGP, set the ASN and the router ID, and configure BGP graceful restart and shutdown), global OSPF options (enable and disable OSPF, set the router ID, and configure OSPF timers), and PBR. |
| `nv set service`<br>`nv unset service` | Configures DHCP relays and servers, NTP, PTP, LLDP, and syslog. |
| `nv set system`<br>`nv unset system` | Configures global system settings, such as the anycast ID, the system MAC address, and the anycast MAC address. This is also where you configure SPAN and ERSPAN sessions. |
| `nv set vrf  <vrf-id>`<br>`nv unset vrf <vrf-id>` | Configures VRFs. This is where you configure VRF-level router configuration including PTP, BGP, OSPF, and EVPN. |

### Monitoring Commands
<!-- vale off -->
The NVUE monitoring commands show various parts of the network configuration. For example, you can show the complete network configuration or only interface configuration. The monitoring commands are in the following categories. Each command group includes subcommands. Use command completion (Tab key) to list the subcommands.
<!-- vale on -->
| <div style="width:300px">Command Group | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `nv show acl` | Shows ACL configuration. |
| `nv show bridge` | Shows bridge domain configuration.|
| `nv show evpn` |Shows EVPN configuration. |
| `nv show interface` |Shows interface configuration. |
| `nv show mlag` | Shows MLAG configuration. |
| `nv show nve` | Shows network virtualization configuration, such as VXLAN-specfic MLAG configuration and VXLAN flooding.|
| `nv show platform` | Shows platform configuration, such as hardware and software components, and the hostname of the switch. |
| `nv show qos` | Shows QoS RoCE configuration.|
| `nv show router` | Shows router configuration, such as router policies, and global BGP and OSPF configuration. |
| `nv show service` | Shows DHCP relays and server, NTP, PTP, LLDP, and syslog configuration. |
| `nv show system` | Shows global system settings, such as the reserved routing table range for PBR and the reserved VLAN range for layer 3 VNIs. You can also see switch reboot history with the reason why the switch rebooted. |
| `nv show vrf` | Shows VRF configuration.|

The following example shows the `nv show router` commands after pressing the TAB key, then shows the output of the `nv show router bgp` command.

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv show router <<TAB>>

cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$
```

{{%notice note%}}
If there are no pending or applied configuration changes, the `nv show` command only shows the running configuration.
{{%/notice%}}

Additional options are available for the `nv show` commands. For example, you can choose the configuration you want to show (pending, applied, startup, or operational). You can also turn on colored output, and paginate specific output.

| <div style="width:200px">Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--applied`       | Shows configuration applied with the `nv config apply` command. For example, `nv show --applied interface bond1`. |
| `--color`         | Turns colored output on or off. For example, `nv show --color on interface bond1`|
| `--help`          | Shows `help` for the NVUE commands. |
| `--operational`   | Shows the running configuration (the actual system state). For example, `nv show --operational interface bond1` shows the running configuration for bond1. The running and applied configuration should be the same. If different, inspect the logs. |
| `--output`        | Shows command output in table format (auto), `json` format or `yaml` format. For example:<br>`nv show --ouptut auto interface bond1`<br>`nv show --output json interface bond1`<br>`nv show --ouptut yaml interface bond1` |
| `--paginate`      | Paginates the output. For example, `nv show --paginate on interface bond1`. |
| `--pending`       | Shows configuration that is `set` and `unset` but not yet applied or saved. For example, `nv show --pending interface bond1`.|
| `--rev <revision>`| Shows a detached pending configuration. See the `nv config detach` configuration management command below. For example, `nv show --rev changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_16.16.41_FPKK interface bond1`. |
| `--startup`       | Shows configuration saved with the `nv config save` command. This is the configuration after the switch boots. |

The following example shows *pending* BGP graceful restart configuration:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv show router bgp graceful-restart --pending
                             pending_20210128_212626_4WSY  description

### Show Legacy Commands

Cumulus Linux includes show legacy commands that provide the same output as the NCLU show commands. To use the show legacy commands, the NCLU service (`netd`) must be running.

{{%notice note%}}
When the NVUE service is running, Cumulus Linux disables NCLU commands (`net add`, `net del`, `net show`) to prevent you from configuring the switch with both NVUE and NVUE commands. For example, if you try to run the `net show interface` command, you see the error `Using NCLU with 'nvued' running is not supported`.
{{%/notice%}}

To run the show legacy commands, replace `net show` with `nv show --legacy`.

For example, to show the link and administrative state of an interface (such as swp1), run the `nv show --legacy interface swp1` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv show --legacy interface swp1
    Name  MAC                Speed  MTU   Mode

### Configuration Management Commands

The NVUE configuration management commands manage and apply configurations.

| <div style="width:450px">Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `nv config apply` | Applies the pending configuration to become the applied configuration.<br>You can also use these prompt options:<ul><li>`--y` or `--assume-yes` to automatically reply `yes` to all prompts.</li><li>`--assume-no` to automatically reply `no` to all prompts.</li></ul> {{%notice note%}}Cumulus Linux applies but does not save the configuration; the configuration does not persist after a reboot.{{%/notice%}}You can also use these apply options:<br>`--confirm` applies the configuration change but you must confirm the applied configuration. If you do not confirm within ten minutes, the configuration rolls back automatically. You can change the default time with the apply `--confirm <time>` command. For example, `apply --confirm 60` requires you to confirm within one hour.<br>`--confirm-status` shows the amount of time left before the automatic rollback.|
| `nv config detach` | Detaches the configuration from the current pending configuration. Cumulus Linux names the detached configuration `pending` and includes a timestamp with extra characters. For example: `pending_20210128_212626_4WSY`|
| `nv config diff <revision> <revision>` | Shows differences between configurations, such as the pending configuration and the applied configuration or the detached configuration and the pending configuration.|
| `nv config history <nvue-file>` | Shows the apply history for the revision. |
| `nv config patch <nvue-file>` | Updates the pending configuration with the specified YAML configuration file. |
| `nv config replace <nvue-file>` | Replaces the pending configuration with the specified YAML configuration file. |
| `nv config save` | Overwrites the startup configuration with the applied configuration by writing to the `/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml` file. The configuration persists after a reboot. |

### List All NVUE Commands

To show the full list of NVUE commands, run `nv list-commands`. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv list-commands
nv show router
nv show router pbr
nv show router pbr nexthop-group
nv show router pbr nexthop-group <nexthop-group-id>
nv show router pbr nexthop-group <nexthop-group-id> via
nv show router pbr nexthop-group <nexthop-group-id> via <nhg-via-id>
nv show router pbr map
nv show router pbr map <pbr-map-id>
nv show router pbr map <pbr-map-id> rule
nv show router pbr map <pbr-map-id> rule <rule-id>
nv show router pbr map <pbr-map-id> rule <rule-id> match
nv show router pbr map <pbr-map-id> rule <rule-id> action
nv show router policy
nv show router policy community-list
...
```

You can show the list of commands for a command grouping. For example, to show the list of interface commands:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv list-commands interface
nv show interface
nv show interface <interface-id>
nv show interface <interface-id> router
nv show interface <interface-id> router pbr
nv show interface <interface-id> router ospf
nv show interface <interface-id> router ospf timers
nv show interface <interface-id> router ospf authentication
nv show interface <interface-id> router ospf bfd
nv show interface <interface-id> bond
nv show interface <interface-id> bond member
nv show interface <interface-id> bond member <member-id>
nv show interface <interface-id> bond mlag
nv show interface <interface-id> bridge
...
```
<!-- vale off -->
Use the Tab key to get help for the command lists you want to see. For example, to show the list of command options available for the interface swp1, run:
<!-- vale on -->
```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv list-commands interface swp1 <<press Tab>>
acl     bond    bridge  evpn    ip      link    ptp     qos     router
```

## NVUE Configuration File

When you save network configuration using NVUE, Cumulus Linux writes the configuration to the `/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml` file.

You can edit or replace the contents of the `/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml` file. NVUE applies the configuration in the `/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml` file during system boot only if the `nvue-startup.service` is running. If this service is not running, the running configuration that you apply last loads when the switch boots.

To start `nvue-startup.service`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl enable nvue-startup.service
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl start nvue-startup.service
```

When you apply a configuration with `nv config apply`, NVUE also writes to underlying Linux files such as `/etc/network/interfaces` and `/etc/frr/frr.conf`. You can view these configuration files; however NVIDIA recommends that you do not manually edit them while using NVUE. If you need to configure certain network settings manually or use automation such as Ansible to configure the switch, see {{<link title="#configure-nvue-to-ignore-linux-files" text="Configure NVUE to Ignore Linux Files">}} below.

## Configure NVUE to Ignore Linux Files

You can configure NVUE to ignore certain underlying Linux files when applying configuration changes. For example, if you push certain configuration to the switch using Ansible and Jinja2 file templates or you want to use custom configuration for a particular service, such as PTP, you can ensure that NVUE never writes to those configuration files.

The following example configures NVUE to ignore the Linux `/etc/ptp4l.conf` file when applying configuration changes and saves the configuration so it persists after a reboot.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set platform config apply ignore /etc/ptp4l.conf
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config save
```

## Example Configuration Commands

This section provides examples of how to configure a Cumulus Linux switch using NVUE commands.

### Configure the System Hostname

The example below shows the NVUE commands required to change the hostname for the switch to leaf01:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set platform hostname value leaf01
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

### Configure the System DNS Server

The example below shows the NVUE commands required to define the DNS server for the switch:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set service dns mgmt server 192.168.200.1
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

### Configure an Interface

The example below shows the NVUE commands required to bring up swp1.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp1 link state up
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

### Configure a Bond

The example below shows the NVUE commands required to configure the front panel port interfaces swp1 thru swp4 to be slaves in bond0.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface bond0 bond member swp1-4
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

### Configure a Bridge

The example below shows the NVUE commands required to create a VLAN-aware bridge that contains two switch ports (swp1 and swp2) and includes 3 VLANs; tagged VLANs 10 and 20 and an untagged (native) VLAN of 1.

With NVUE, there is a default bridge called `br_default`, which has no ports assigned to it. The example below configures this default bridge.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp1-2 bridge domain br_default
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set bridge domain br_default vlan 10,20
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set bridge domain br_default untagged 1
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

### Configure MLAG

The example below shows the NVUE commands required to configure MLAG on leaf01. The commands:
- Place swp1 into bond1 and swp2 into bond2.
- Configure the MLAG ID to 1 for bond1 and to 2 for bond2.
- Add bond1 and bond2 to the default bridge (br_default).
- Create the inter-chassis bond (swp49 and swp50) and the peer link (peerlink)
- Set the peer link IP address to `linklocal`, the MLAG system MAC address to 44:38:39:BE:EF:AA, and the backup interface to 10.10.10.2.

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set interface bond1 bond member swp1
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set interface bond2 bond member swp2
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set interface bond1 bond mlag id 1
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set interface bond2 bond mlag id 2
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface bond1-2 bridge domain br_default
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set interface peerlink bond member swp49-50
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set mlag mac-address 44:38:39:BE:EF:AA
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set mlag backup 10.10.10.2
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set mlag peer-ip linklocal
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv config apply
```

### Configure BGP Unnumbered

The example below shows the NVUE commands required to configure BGP unnumbered on leaf01. The commands:
- Assign the ASN for this BGP node to 65101.
- Set the router ID to 10.10.10.1.
- Distribute routing information to the peer on swp51.
- Originate prefixes 10.10.10.1/32 from this BGP node.

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set router bgp autonomous-system 65101
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set router bgp router-id 10.10.10.1
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set vrf default router bgp peer swp51 remote-as external
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set vrf default router bgp address-family ipv4-unicast static-network 10.10.10.1/32
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv config apply
```

## Example Monitoring Commands

## Example Configuration Management Commands

This section provides examples of how to use the configuration management commands to apply, save, and detach configurations.

### Apply and Save a Configuration

The following example command configures the front panel port interfaces swp1 thru swp4 to be slaves in bond0. The configuration is only in a pending configuration state. The configuration is **not** applied. NVUE has not yet made any changes to the running configuration.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface bond0 bond member swp1-4
```

To apply the pending configuration to the running configuration, run the `nv config apply` command. The configuration does **not** persist after a reboot.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

To save the applied configuration to the startup configuration, run the `nv config save` command. This command overwrites the startup configuration with the applied configuration by writing to the `/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml` file. The configuration persists after a reboot.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config save
```

### Detach a Pending Configuration

The following example configures the IP address of the loopback interface, then detaches the configuration from the current pending configuration. Cumulus Linux saves the detached configuration to a file `changeset/cumulus/<date>_<time>_xxxx` that includes a timestamp with extra characters to distinguish it from other pending configurations; for example, `changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_18.35.06_FPKP`.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface lo ip address 10.10.10.1
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config detach
```

### View Differences Between Configurations

To view differences between configurations, run the `nv config diff` command.

To view differences between two detached pending configurations, run the `nv config diff` <<TAB>> command to list all the current detached pending configurations, then run the `nv config diff` command with the pending configurations you want to diff:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config diff <<press Tab>>
applied                                     changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_18.35.06_FPKP
changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_16.16.41_FPKK  empty
changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_17.05.12_FPKN  startup
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config diff changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_18.35.06_FPKP changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_17.05.12_FPKN
```

To view differences between a detached pending configuration and the applied configuration:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config diff changeset/cumulus/2021-06-11_18.35.06_FPKP applied
```

### Replace and Patch a Pending Configuration

The following example replaces the pending configuration with the contents of the YAML configuration file called `nv-02/13/2021.yaml` located in the `/deps` directory:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config replace /deps/nv-02/13/2021.yaml
```

The following example patches the pending configuration (runs the set or unset commands from the configuration in the `nv-02/13/2021.yaml` file located in the `/deps` directory):

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config patch /deps/nv-02/13/2021.yaml
```

## Flexible Snippet Architecture

If you configure Cumulus Linux with NVUE commands, then want to configure a feature that does not yet support the NVUE Object Model, you can create a snippet in `yaml` format and add the configuration to either the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` or `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

{{< tabs "612 ">}}
{{< tab "/etc/frr/frr.conf Snippets ">}}

In Cumulus Linux 4.4, NVUE does not support configuring the loopback interface in an OSPF area. The following example configures the loopback interface to be in OSPF area 0:

1. Create a `.yaml` file with the following snippet:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano ./ospf_snippet.yaml
   - set:
       platform:
         config:
           snippet:
             frr.conf: |
               interface lo
               ip ospf area 0
   ```

2. Run the following command to patch the configuration:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config patch ./ospf_snippet.yaml
   ```

3. Run the `nv config apply` command to apply the configuration:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
   ```

4. Verify that the configuration exists at the end of the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cat /etc/frr/frr.conf
   ...
   ! end of router ospf block
   !---- CUE snippets ----
   interface lo
   ip ospf area 0
   ```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "/etc/network/interfaces Snippets ">}}

{{< tabs "667 ">}}
{{< tab "Configure an Interface Description ">}}

In Cumulus Linux 4.4, NVUE does not support configuring interface descriptions (aliases). The following example configures the loopback interface with the description `loopback` and swp1 with the description `bond_member_of_bond1`:

1. Create a `.yaml` file and add the following snippet:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano ./alias_snippet.yaml
- set:
    platform:
      config:
        snippet:
          ifupdown2_eni:
            lo: |
              alias loopback
            swp1: |
              alias bond_member_of_bond1
```

2. Run the following command to patch the configuration:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config patch ./alias_snippet.yaml
   ```

3. Run the `nv config apply` command to apply the configuration:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
   ```

4. Verify that the configuration exists in the lo and swp1 stanzas in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cat /etc/network/interfaces
   ...
   auto lo
   iface lo inet loopback
     alias loopback
     address 10.10.10.1/32
   auto swp1
   iface swp1
     alias bond_member_of_bond1
   ...
   ```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Configure a Traditional Bridge ">}}

In Cumulus Linux 4.4, NVUE does not support configuring traditional bridges. The following example configures a traditional bridge called `br0` with the IP address 11.0.0.10/24. swp1, swp2 are members of the bridge.

1. Create a `.yaml` file and add the following snippet:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano ./bridge_snippet.yaml
- set:
    platform:
     config:
       snippet:
         ifupdown2_eni:
           eni_stanzas: |
             auto br0
             iface br0
               address 11.0.0.10/24
               bridge-ports swp1 swp2
               bridge-vlan-aware no
```

2. Run the following command to patch the configuration:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config patch ./bridge_snippet.yaml
   ```

3. Run the `nv config apply` command to apply the configuration:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
   ```

4. Verify that the configuration exists at the end of the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cat /etc/network/interfaces
   ...
   auto br0
   iface br0
     address 11.0.0.10/24
     bridge-ports swp1 swp2
     bridge-vlan-aware no
   ```

## How Is NVUE Different from NCLU?

This section lists some of the differences between the NVUE CLI and the NCLU CLI.

### Configuration File

When you save network configuration using NVUE, Cumulus Linux saves the configuration in the `/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml` file.

NVUE also writes to underlying Linux files when you apply a configuration, such as the `/etc/network/interfaces` and `/etc/frr/frr.conf` files. You can view these configuration files; however NVIDIA recommends that you do not manually edit them while using NVUE.

### Bridge Configuration

You set global bridge configuration on the bridge domain. For example:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set bridge domain br_default vlan 10,20
```

However, you set specific bridge interface options with interface commands. For example:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set interface swp1 bridge domain br_default learning on
```

The default VLAN-aware bridge in NVUE is `br_default`. The default VLAN-aware bridge in NCLU is `bridge`.

### BGP Configuration

You can set global BGP configuration, such as the ASN, router ID, graceful shutdown and restart with the `nv set router bgp` command. For example:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set router bgp autonomous-system 65101
```

However, BGP peer and peer group, route information, timer, and address family configuration requires a VRF. For example:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set vrf default router bgp peer swp51 remote-as external
```
