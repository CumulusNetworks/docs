{{<exlink url="http://www.netfilter.org/" text="Netfilter">}} is the packet filtering framework in Cumulus Linux and most other Linux distributions. There several tools available for configuring ACLs in Cumulus Linux:

- `iptables`, `ip6tables`, and `ebtables` are Linux userspace tools used to administer filtering rules for IPv4 packets, IPv6 packets, and Ethernet frames (layer 2 using MAC addresses).
- `cl-acltool` is a Cumulus Linux-specific userspace tool used to administer filtering rules and configure default ACLs. `cl-acltool` operates on various configuration files and uses `iptables`, `ip6tables`, and `ebtables` to install rules into the kernel. In addition, `cl-acltool` programs rules in hardware for interfaces involving switch port interfaces, which `iptables`, `ip6tables` and `ebtables` cannot do on their own.

## Traffic Rules

### Chains

Netfilter describes the way that the Linux kernel classifies and controls packets to, from, and across the switch. Netfilter does not require a separate software daemon to run; it is part of the Linux kernel itself. Netfilter asserts policies at layer 2, 3 and 4 of the {{<exlink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model" text="OSI model">}} by inspecting packet and frame headers according to a list of rules. The `iptables`, `ip6tables`, and `ebtables` userspace applications provide syntax you use to define rules.

The rules inspect or operate on packets at several points (*chains*) in the life of the packet through the system:

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-chains.png" >}}

- **PREROUTING** touches packets before the switch routes them
- **INPUT** touches packets after the switch determines that the packets are for the local system but before the control plane software receives them
- **FORWARD** touches transit traffic as it moves through the switch
- **OUTPUT** touches packets from the control plane software before they leave the switch
- **POSTROUTING** touches packets immediately before they leave the switch but after a routing decision

### Tables

When you build rules to affect the flow of traffic, *tables* can access the individual chains. Linux provides three tables by default:

- **Filter** classifies traffic or filters traffic
- **NAT** applies Network Address Translation rules
- **Mangle** alters packets as they move through the switch

Each table has a set of default chains that modify or inspect packets at different points of the path through the switch. Chains contain the individual rules to influence traffic. The figure below shows each table and the default chains they support. Cumulus Linux supports the tables and chains in green. Cumulus Linux does not support the tables and chains in red.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acls-supported.png" >}}

### Rules

Rules classify the traffic you want to control. You apply rules to chains, which attach to tables.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-tables-chains-rules.png" >}}

Rules have several different components:

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-anatomy-rule.png" >}}

- **Table:** The first argument is the *table*. The second example does not specify a table; the filter table is the default.
- **Chain:** The second argument is the *chain*. Each table supports several different chains. See {{<link url="#tables" text="Tables">}} above.
- **Matches:** The third argument is the *match*. You can specify multiple matches in a single rule. However, the more matches you use in a rule, the more memory the rule consumes.
- **Jump:** The *jump* specifies the target of the rule; what action to take if the packet matches the rule. If you omit this option in a rule, matching the rule has no effect on the packet, but the counters on the rule increment.
- **Targets:** The *target* is a user-defined chain (other than the one this rule is in), one of the special built-in targets that decides the fate of the packet immediately (like DROP), or an extended target. See {{<link url="#supported-rule-types" text="Supported Rule Types">}} below for different target examples.

### How Rules Parse and Apply

The switch reads all the rules from each chain from `iptables`, `ip6tables`, and `ebtables` and enters them in order into either the filter table or the mangle table. The switch reads the rules from the kernel in the following order:

- IPv6 (`ip6tables`)
- IPv4 (`iptables`)
- `ebtables`

When you combine and put rules into one table, the order determines the relative priority of the rules; `iptables` and `ip6tables` have the highest precedence and `ebtables` has the lowest.

The Linux packet forwarding construct is an overlay for how the silicon underneath processes packets. Be aware of the following:

- The switch silicon reorders rules when `switchd` writes to the ASIC, whereas traditional `iptables` execute the list of rules in order.
- All rules, except for POLICE and SETCLASS rules, are terminating; after a rule matches, the action occurs and no more rules process. In the example below, the SETCLASS action with the `--in-interface` option creates the internal ASIC classification, and continues to process the next rule, which provides rate-limiting for the matched protocol:

    ```
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p udp --dport $BFD_ECHO_PORT -j SETCLASS --class 7
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_ECHO_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000
    ```

- When processing traffic, rules affecting the FORWARD chain that specify an ingress interface process before rules that match on an egress interface. As a workaround, rules that only affect the egress interface can have an ingress interface wildcard (only *swp+* and *bond+*) that matches any interface you apply so that you can maintain order of operations with other input interface rules. For example, with the following rules:

    ```
    -A FORWARD -i $PORTA -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD -o $PORTA -j ACCEPT   <-- This rule processes LAST (because of egress interface matching)
    -A FORWARD -i $PORTB -j DROP
    ```

    If you modify the rules like this, they process in order:

    ```
    -A FORWARD -i $PORTA -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD -i swp+ -o $PORTA -j ACCEPT   <-- These rules are performed in order (because of wildcard match on the ingress interface)
    -A FORWARD -i $PORTB -j DROP
    ```

- When using rules that do a mangle and a filter lookup for a packet, Cumulus Linux processes them in parallel and combines the action.
- If a switch port has a bond, you must assign any egress rules to the bond.
- When using the OUTPUT chain, you must assign rules to the source. For example, if you assign a rule to the switch port in the direction of traffic but the source is a bridge (VLAN), the rule does not affect the traffic and you must apply it to the bridge.
- If you need to apply a rule to all transit traffic, use the FORWARD chain, not the OUTPUT chain.
- The switch puts `ebtable` rules into either the IPv4 or IPv6 memory space depending on whether the rule uses IPv4 or IPv6 to make a decision. The switch only puts layer 2 rules that match the MAC address into the IPv4 memory space.

### Rule Placement in Memory

INPUT and ingress (`FORWARD -i`) rules occupy the same memory space. A rule counts as ingress if you set the `-i` option. If you set both input and output options (`-i` and `-o`), the switch considers the rule as ingress and occupies that memory space. For example:

```
-A FORWARD -i swp1 -o swp2 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
```

{{%notice note%}}
If you set an output flag with the INPUT chain, you see an error. For example:

```
-A FORWARD,INPUT -i swp1 -o swp2 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
error: line 2 : output interface specified with INPUT chain error processing rule '-A FORWARD,INPUT -i swp1 -o swp2 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT'
```

If you remove the `-o` option and the interface, it is a valid rule.
{{%/notice%}}

### Nonatomic Update Mode and Atomic Update Mode
<!-- vale on -->
Cumulus Linux enables *atomic update mode* by default. However, this mode limits the number of ACL rules that you can configure.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-update-operation-atomic.png" >}}

To increase the number of configurable ACL rules, configure the switch to operate in *nonatomic mode*.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-update-operation-nonatomic.png" >}}

Instead of reserving 50% of your TCAM space for atomic updates, incremental update uses the available free space to write the new TCAM rules and swap over to the new rules after this is complete. Cumulus Linux then deletes the old rules and frees up the original TCAM space. If there is insufficient free space to complete this task, the original nonatomic update runs, which interrupts traffic.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-update-del.png" >}}

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-update-add.png" >}}

You can enable nonatomic updates for `switchd`, which offer better scaling because all TCAM resources actively impact traffic. With atomic updates, half of the hardware resources are on standby and do not actively impact traffic.

*Incremental nonatomic updates* are table based, so they do not interrupt network traffic when you install new rules. The rules map to the following tables and update in this order:

- mirror (ingress only)
- ipv4-mac (can be both ingress and egress)
- ipv6 (ingress only)

The incremental nonatomic update operation follows this order:

1. Updates are incremental, one table at a time without stopping traffic.
2. Cumulus Linux checks if the rules in a table are different from installation time; if a table does not have any changes, it does not reinstall the rules.
3. If there are changes in a table, the new rules populate in new groups or slices in hardware, then that table switches over to the new groups or slices.
4. Finally, old resources for that table free up. This process repeats for each of the tables listed above.
5. If there are isufficient resources to hold both the new rule set and old rule set, Cumulus Linux tries the regular nonatomic mode, which interrupts network traffic.
6. If the regular nonatomic update fails, Cumulus Linux reverts back to the previous rules.

To always start `switchd` with nonatomic updates:

1. Edit `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf`.
2. Add the following line to the file:

    ```
    acl.non_atomic_update_mode = TRUE
    ```

3. {{%link url="Configuring-switchd#restart-switchd" text="Restart `switchd`"%}}:

   {{<cl/restart-switchd>}}

{{%notice note%}}
During regular *non-incremental nonatomic updates*, traffic stops, then continues after all the new configuration is in the hardware.
{{%/notice%}}

### iptables, ip6tables, and ebtables

Do not use `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `ebtables` directly; installed rules only apply to the Linux kernel and Cumulus Linux does not hardware accelerate. When you run `cl-acltool -i`, Cumulus Linux resets all rules and deletes anything that is not in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`.

For example, the following rule appears to work:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP
```

The `cl-acltool -L` command shows the rule:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -L ip
-------------------------------
Listing rules of type iptables:
-------------------------------

TABLE filter :
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 72 packets, 5236 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
0 0 DROP icmp -- any any anywhere anywhere icmp echo-request
```

However, Cumulus Linux does not synchronize the rule to hardware. Running `cl-acltool -i` or `reboot` removes the rule without replacing it. To ensure that Cumulus Linux hardware accelerates all rules that can be in hardware, add them to `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf` and install them with the `cl-acltool -i` command.

### Estimate the Number of Rules

To estimate the number of rules you can create from an ACL entry, first determine if that entry is an ingress or an egress. Then, determine if it is an IPv4-mac or IPv6 type rule. This determines the slice to which the rule belongs. Use the following to determine how many entries the switch uses for each type.

By default, each entry occupies one double wide entry, except if the entry is one of the following:

- An entry with multiple comma-separated input interfaces splits into one rule for each input interface. For example, this entry splits into two rules:

  ```
  -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1s0,swp1s1 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
  ```

- An entry with multiple comma-separated output interfaces splits into one rule for each output interface. This entry splits into two rules:

    ```
    -A FORWARD --in-interface swp+ --out-interface swp1s0,swp1s1 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
    ```

- An entry with both input and output comma-separated interfaces splits into one rule for each combination of input and output interface This entry splits into four rules:

    ```
    -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1s0,swp1s1 --out-interface swp1s2,swp1s3 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
    ```

- An entry with multiple layer 4 port ranges splits into one rule for each range. For example, this entry splits into two rules:

    ```
    -A FORWARD --in-interface swp+ -p tcp -m multiport --dports 1050:1051,1055:1056 -j ACCEPT
    ```

   {{%notice note%}}
You can only use port ranges for ingress rules.

## Install and Manage ACL Rules with NCLU

NCLU provides an easy way to create custom ACLs. The rules you create live in the `/var/lib/cumulus/nclu/nclu_acl.conf` file, which Cumulus Linux converts to a rules file, `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/50_nclu_acl.rules`. The rules you create with NCLU are independent of the default files in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/` `00control_plane.rules` and `99control_plane_catch_all.rules`. If you update the content in these files after a Cumulus Linux upgrade, you do not lose the rules.

Instead of crafting a rule by hand then installing it with `cl-acltool`, NCLU handles most options automatically. For example, consider the following `iptables` rule:

```
-A FORWARD -i swp1 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
```

To create this rule  with NCLU and call it *EXAMPLE1*:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 accept tcp source-ip 10.0.14.2/32 source-port any dest-ip 10.0.15.8/32 dest-port any
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

NCLU adds all options, such as the `-j` and `-p`, even `FORWARD` in the above rule automatically when you apply the rule to the control plane; NCLU figures it all out for you.

You can also set a priority value, which specifies the order in which the rules execute and the order in which they appear in the rules file. Lower numbers execute first. To add a new rule in the middle, first run `net show config acl`, which displays the priority numbers. Otherwise, new rules append to the end of the list of rules in the `nclu_acl.conf` and `50_nclu_acl.rules` files.

{{%notice note%}}

If you need to edit a rule manually, do not edit the `50_nclu_acl.rules` file. Instead, edit the `nclu_acl.conf` file.

{{%/notice%}}

After you add the rule, you need to apply it to an inbound or outbound interface with the `net add int acl` command. The inbound interface in the following example is swp1:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add int swp1 acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

After you commit your changes, verify the rule; run `net show configuration acl`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show configuration acl
acl ipv4 EXAMPLEv4 priority 10 accept tcp source-ip 10.0.14.2/32 source-port any dest-ip 10.0.15.8/32 dest-port any

interface swp1
acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound
```

To see all installed rules, run `cat` on the `50_nclu_acl.rules` file:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/50_nclu_acl.rules
[iptables]
# swp1: acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound
-A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 --out-interface swp2 -j ACCEPT -p tcp -s 10.0.14.2/32 -d 10.0.15.8/32 --dport 110
```

For rules affecting the INPUT chain, apply the rule to a control plane interface with `net add control-plane`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add control-plane acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

To remove a rule, run `net del acl ipv4|ipv6|mac RULENAME`. This command deletes all rules from the `50_nclu_acl.rules` file with the name you specify. The command also deletes the interfaces referenced in the `nclu_acl.conf` file.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net del acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

<!-- vale off -->
## Install and Manage ACL Rules with cl-acltool
<!-- vale on -->
You can manage Cumulus Linux ACLs with `cl-acltool`. Rules write first to the `iptables` chains, as described above, and then synchronize to hardware through `switchd`.

To examine the current state of chains and list all installed rules, run:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -L all
 -------------------------------
Listing rules of type iptables:
-------------------------------

TABLE filter :
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 90 packets, 14456 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any 240.0.0.0/5 anywhere
0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any loopback/8 anywhere
0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any base-address.mcast.net/8 anywhere
0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any 255.255.255.255 anywhere ...
```

To list installed rules using native `iptables`, `ip6tables` and `ebtables`, use the `-L` option with the respective commands:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo iptables -L
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ip6tables -L
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ebtables -L
```

To flush all installed rules, run:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -F all
```

To flush only the IPv4 `iptables` rules, run:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -F ip
```

If the install fails, ACL rules in the kernel and hardware roll back to the previous state. You also see errors from programming rules in the kernel or ASIC.

## Install Packet Filtering (ACL) Rules

`cl-acltool` takes access control list (ACL) rule input in files. Each ACL policy file includes `iptables`, `ip6tables` and `ebtables` categories under the tags `[iptables]`, `[ip6tables]` and `[ebtables]`. You must assign each rule in an ACL policy to one of the rule categories.

See `man cl-acltool(5)` for ACL rule details. For `iptables` rule syntax, see `man iptables(8)`. For `ip6tables` rule syntax, see `man ip6tables(8)`. For `ebtables` rule syntax, see `man ebtables(8)`.

See `man cl-acltool(5)` and `man cl-acltool(8)` for more details on using `cl-acltool`.

{{%notice note%}}
By default:

- ACL policy files are in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/`.
- All `*.rules` files in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/` directory are also in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`.
- All files in the `policy.conf` file install when the switch boots up.
- The `policy.conf` file expects rule files to have a `.rules` suffix as part of the file name.
{{%/notice%}}

Here is an example ACL policy file:

```
[iptables]
-A INPUT --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

[ip6tables]
-A INPUT --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

[ebtables]
-A INPUT -p IPv4 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -p IPv4 -j ACCEPT
```

You can use wildcards or variables to specify chain and interface lists.

{{%notice note%}}
You can only use *swp+* and *bond+* as wildcard names.

swp+ rules apply as an aggregate, *not* per port. If you want to apply per port policing, specify a specific port instead of the wildcard.
{{%/notice%}}

```
INGRESS = swp+
INPUT_PORT_CHAIN = INPUT,FORWARD

[iptables]
-A $INPUT_PORT_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

[ip6tables]
-A $INPUT_PORT_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

[ebtables]
-A INPUT -p IPv4 -j ACCEPT
```

You can write ACL rules for the system into multiple files under the default `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/` directory. The ordering of rules during installation follows the sort order of the files according to their file names.

Use multiple files to stack rules. The example below shows two rule files that separate rules for management and datapath traffic:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ ls /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/
00sample_mgmt.rules 01sample_datapath.rules
cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/00sample_mgmt.rules

INGRESS_INTF = swp+
INGRESS_CHAIN = INPUT

[iptables]
# protect the switch management
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 10.0.11.2 -d 10.0.12.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -d 10.0.16.8 -p udp -j DROP

cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01sample_datapath.rules
INGRESS_INTF = swp+
INGRESS_CHAIN = INPUT, FORWARD

[iptables]
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 192.0.2.5 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 192.0.2.6 -d 192.0.2.4 -j DROP
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 192.0.2.2 -d 192.0.2.8 -j DROP
```

Install all ACL policies under a directory:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -i -P ./rules
Reading files under rules
Reading rule file ./rules/01_http_rules.txt ...
Processing rules in file ./rules/01_http_rules.txt ...
Installing acl policy ...
Done.
```

Apply all rules and policies included in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -i
```

## Specify the Policy Files to Install

By default, Cumulus Linux installs any `.rules` file you configure in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/`. To add other policy files to an ACL, you need to include them in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`. For example, for Cumulus Linux to install a rule in a policy file called `01_new.datapathacl`, add `include /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01_new.rules` to `policy.conf`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf

#
# This file is a master file for acl policy file inclusion
#
# Note: This is not a file where you list acl rules.
#
# This file can contain:
# - include lines with acl policy files
#   example:
#     include <filepath>
#
# see manpage cl-acltool(5) and cl-acltool(8) for how to write policy files 
#

include /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01_new.datapathacl
```

## Hardware Limitations on Number of Rules

The maximum number of rules that the hardware process depends on:

- The mix of IPv4 and IPv6 rules; Cumulus Linux does not support the maximum number of rules for both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
- The number of default rules that Cumulus Linux provides.
- Whether the rules apply on ingress or egress.
- Whether the rules are in atomic or nonatomic mode; Cumulus Linux uses nonatomic mode rules when you enable nonatomic updates ({{<link url="#nonatomic-update-mode-and-atomic-update-mode" text="see above">}}).

If you exceed the maximum number of rules for a particular table, `cl-acltool -i` generates the following error:

```
error: hw sync failed (sync_acl hardware installation failed) Rolling back .. failed.
```

In the table below, the default rules count toward the limits listed. The raw limits below assume only one ingress and one egress table are present.

The NVIDIA Spectrum ASIC has one common {{<exlink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_memory#Ternary_CAMs" text="TCAM">}} for both ingress and egress, which you can use for other non-ACL-related resources. However, the number of supported rules varies with the {{<link url="Supported-Route-Table-Entries#tcam-resource-profiles-for-spectrum-switches" text="TCAM profile">}} for the switch.
<!-- vale off -->
|Profile |Atomic Mode IPv4 Rules |Atomic Mode IPv6 Rules |Nonatomic Mode IPv4 Rules |Nonatomic Mode IPv6 Rules |

|ip-acl-heavy |7500 |0 |15000 |0|
<!-- vale on -->
{{%notice note%}}
Even though the table above specifies the ip-acl-heavy profile supports no IPv6 rules, Cumulus Linux does not prevent you from configuring IPv6 rules. However, there is no guarantee that IPv6 rules work under the ip-acl-heavy profile.
{{%/notice%}}

## Supported Rule Types

The `iptables`/`ip6tables`/`ebtables` construct tries to layer the Linux implementation on top of the underlying hardware but they are not always directly compatible. This section provides the supported rules for chains in `iptables`, `ip6tables` and `ebtables`.

To learn more about any of the options shown in the tables below, run `iptables -h [name of option]`. The same help syntax works for options for `ip6tables` and `ebtables`.

```
root@leaf1# ebtables -h tricolorpolice
...
tricolorpolice option:
--set-color-mode STRING setting the mode in blind or aware
--set-cir INT setting committed information rate in kbits per second
--set-cbs INT setting committed burst size in kbyte
--set-pir INT setting peak information rate in kbits per second
--set-ebs INT setting excess burst size in kbyte
--set-conform-action-dscp INT setting dscp value if the action is accept for conforming packets
--set-exceed-action-dscp INT setting dscp value if the action is accept for exceeding packets
--set-violate-action STRING setting the action (accept/drop) for violating packets
--set-violate-action-dscp INT setting dscp value if the action is accept for violating packets
Supported chains for the filter table:
INPUT FORWARD OUTPUT

### Unsupported Rules

- Rules that have no matches and accept all packets in a chain are currently ignored.
- Chain default rules (that are ACCEPT) are also ignored.

### Splitting Rules Across the Ingress TCAM and the Egress TCAM

Splitting rules across the ingress TCAM and the egress TCAM causes the ingress IPv6 part of the rule to match packets going to all destinations, which can interfere with the regular expected linear rule match in a sequence. For example:

A higher rule can prevent a lower rule from matching:

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan100 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 2: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan101 -p icmp6 -s 01::02 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 1 matches all icmp6 packets from to all out interfaces in the ingress TCAM.`

This prevents rule 2 from matching, which is more specific but with a different out interface. Make sure to put more specific matches above more general matches even if the output interfaces are different.

When you have two rules with the same output interface, the lower rule might match depending on the presence of the previous rules.

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan100 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 2: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan101 -s 00::01 -j DROP`

Rule 3: `-A FORWARD --out -interface vlan101 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 3 still matches for an icmp6 packet with sip 00:01 going out of vlan101. Rule 1 interferes with the normal function of rule 2 and/or rule 3.

When you have two adjacent rules with the same match and different output interfaces, such as:

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan100 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 2: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan101 -p icmp6 -j DROP`

Rule 2 never matches on ingress. Both rules share the same mark.

## Control Plane and Data Plane Traffic

You can configure quality of service for traffic on both the control plane and the data plane. By using QoS policers, you can rate limit traffic so incoming packets get dropped if they exceed specified thresholds.

{{%notice note%}}
Counters on POLICE ACL rules in `iptables` do not show dropped packets due to those rules.
{{%/notice%}}

Use the `POLICE` target with `iptables`. `POLICE` takes these arguments:

- `--set-class value` sets the system internal class of service queue configuration to *value*.
- `--set-rate value` specifies the maximum rate in kilobytes (KB) or packets.
- `--set-burst value` specifies the number of packets or kilobytes (KB) allowed to arrive sequentially.
- `--set-mode string` sets the mode in *KB* (kilobytes) or *pkt* (packets) for rate and burst size.

For example, to rate limit the incoming traffic on swp1 to 400 packets per second with a burst of 100 packets per second and set the class of the queue for the policed traffic as 0, set this rule in your appropriate `.rules` file:

```
-A INPUT --in-interface swp1 -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 400 --set-burst 100 --set-class 0
```

Here is another example of control plane ACL rules to lock down the switch. You specify the rules in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/00control_plane.rules`:

## Set DSCP on Transit Traffic

The examples here use the *mangle* table to modify the packet as it transits the switch. DSCP is in {{<exlink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services#Configuration_guidelines" text="decimal notation">}} in the examples below.

```
[iptables]

#Set SSH as high priority traffic.
-t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 22  -j DSCP --set-dscp 46

#Set everything coming in SWP1 as AF13
-t mangle -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -j DSCP --set-dscp 14

#Set Packets destined for 10.0.100.27 as best effort
-t mangle -A FORWARD -d 10.0.100.27/32 -j DSCP --set-dscp 0

#Example using a range of ports for TCP traffic
-t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 10.0.0.17/32 --sport 10000:20000 -d 10.0.100.27/32 --dport 10000:20000 -j DSCP --set-dscp 34
```

## Verify DSCP Values on Transit Traffic

The examples here use the DSCP match criteria in combination with other IP, TCP, and interface matches to identify traffic and count the number of packets.

```
[iptables]

#Match and count the packets that match SSH traffic with DSCP EF
-A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 22 -m dscp --dscp 46 -j ACCEPT

#Match and count the packets coming in SWP1 as AF13
-A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -m dscp --dscp 14 -j ACCEPT
#Match and count the packets with a destination 10.0.0.17 marked best effort
-A FORWARD -d 10.0.100.27/32 -m dscp --dscp 0 -j ACCEPT

#Match and count the packets in a port range with DSCP AF41
-A FORWARD -p tcp -s 10.0.0.17/32 --sport 10000:20000 -d 10.0.100.27/32 --dport 10000:20000 -m dscp --dscp 34 -j ACCEPT
```

## Check the Packet and Byte Counters for ACL Rules

To verify the counters using the above example rules, first send test traffic matching the patterns through the network. The following example generates traffic with `{{<exlink url="http://www.netsniff-ng.org" text="mz">}}` (or `mausezahn`), which you can install on host servers or on Cumulus Linux switches. After you send traffic to validate the counters, they match on switch1 using `cl-acltool`.

{{%notice note%}}
Policing counters do not increment on switches with the Spectrum ASIC.

## Filter Specific TCP Flags

The example solution below creates rules on the INPUT and FORWARD chains to drop ingress IPv4 and IPv6 TCP packets when you set the SYN bit and reset the RST, ACK, and FIN bits. The default for the INPUT and FORWARD chains allows all other packets. The ACL apply to ports swp20 and swp21. After configuring this ACL, you cannot establish new TCP sessions that originate from ingress ports swp20 and swp21. You can establish TCP sessions that originate from any other port.

```
INGRESS_INTF = swp20,swp21

[iptables]
-A INPUT,FORWARD --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --syn -j DROP
[ip6tables]
-A INPUT,FORWARD --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --syn -j DROP
```

The `--syn` flag in the above rule matches packets with the SYN bit set and the ACK, RST, and FIN bits cleared. It is equivalent to using `-tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK,FIN SYN`. For example, you can write the above rule as:

```
-A INPUT,FORWARD --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK,FIN SYN -j DROP
```

## Control Who Can SSH into the Switch

Run the following NCLU commands to control who can SSH into the switch.
In the following example, 10.0.0.11/32 is the interface IP address (or loopback IP address) of the switch and 10.255.4.0/24 can SSH into the switch.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 test priority 10 accept source-ip 10.255.4.0/24 dest-ip 10.0.0.11/32
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 test priority 20 drop source-ip any dest-ip 10.0.0.11/32
cumulus@switch:~$ net add control-plane acl ipv4 test inbound
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{%notice note%}}
Cumulus Linux does not support the keyword `iprouter` (typically used for traffic that goes to the CPU, where the destination MAC address is that of the router but the destination IP address is not the router).
{{%/notice%}}

## Match on VLAN IDs on Layer 2 Interfaces

You can match on VLAN IDs on layer 2 interfaces for ingress rules. The following example matches on a VLAN and DSCP class, and sets the internal class of the packet. For extended matching on IP fields, combine this rule with ingress iptable rules.

```
[ebtables]
-A FORWARD -p 802_1Q --vlan-id 100 -j mark --mark-set 0x66

[iptables]
-A FORWARD -i swp31 -m mark --mark 0x66 -m dscp --dscp-class CS1 -j SETCLASS --class 2
```
<!--
## Reflexive ACLs

{{%notice note%}}
Cumulus Linux 4.4.1 and later supports reflexive ACLs.
{{%/notice%}}

Reflexive ACLs enable you to control and restrict unwanted connections and flows throught the switch. For example, you can configure reflexive ACLs to allow and police established flows that want to access a service on a layer 4 port in a subnet. Instead of installing a new static rule for each incoming connection, the switch evaluates packets as they come in and installs dynamic ACCEPT ACLs for each connection.

Cumulus Linux supports reflexive ACLs for TCP, UDP, and ICMP IPv4 traffic for connections that originate outside a network (from a host in the ISP network) and connections that originate inside the network. Reflexive ACLs restrict unestablished flows by policing them.

To configure reflexive ACL rules:

1. Enable reflexive ACLs:

   {{< tabs "TabID818 ">}}
{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add reflexive-acl-enable
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Edit /etc/cumulus/switchd.conf ">}}

In the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` file, uncomment and change the `rflx.reflexive_acl_enable` setting to TRUE, then restart `switchd`.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.conf
...
rflx.reflexive_acl_enable = TRUE
```

{{<cl/restart-switchd>}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

2. Configure these rule types:
   - An ingress rule with conntrack parameters (invalid, new, established, related, untracked).
   - An egress rule with conntrack parameters (invalid, new, established, related, untracked).
   - An ingress rule with the same IP address, port, and protocol matches as the conntrack rule with a POLICE action.
   - An egress rule with the same IP address, port, and protocol matches as the conntrack rule with a POLICE action.

   The following example rules configure TCP reflexive ACLs with a POLICE action:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ net add policer-template rflx_policer mode packet rate 2000 burst 2000
   cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_ingress accept conntrack established,related tcp source-ip any source-port 1000 dest-ip 192.168.2.1/24 dest-port 80
   cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_ingress police rflx_policer tcp source-ip any source-port 1000 dest-ip 192.168.2.1/24 dest-port 80
   cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_egress accept conntrack established,related tcp source-ip 192.168.2.1/24 source-port 80 dest-ip any dest-port 1000
   cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_egress police rflx_policer tcp source-ip 192.168.2.1/24 source-port 80 dest-ip any dest-port 1000
   ```

3. Configure the interface on which you want to use the reflexive ACLs:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 20 acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_ingress inbound
   cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 20 acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_egress outbound
   cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
   ```

For UDP and ICMP flows, you can police a new connection until the connection establishes by setting the timeout interval for inactvity:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add reflexive-acl age-poll-interval 8
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

You can also set the rate (in packets per second) for trapped packets and for the unreplied ingress flow:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add reflexive-acl trap-group-policer-rate 500
cumulus@switch:~$ net add reflexive-acl unreplied-ingress-policer-rate 2000
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

To show all interfaces with reflexive ACL rules, run the NCL `net show reflexive-acl status` command.

You can remove a reflexive ACL from an interface with the `net del <interface> acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_ingress`
and `net del <interface> acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_egress` commands:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net del vlan 20 acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_ingress inbound
cumulus@switch:~$ net del vlan 20 acl ipv4 rflx_tcp_egress outbound
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```
## Match on ECN Bits in the TCP IP Header

[ECN](## "Explicit Congestion Notification") allows end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets. In Cumulus Linux 4.4.2 and later, you can add ECN rules to match on the [ECE](## "ECN-Echo"), [CWR](## "Congestion Window Received"), and [ECT](## "ECN Capable Transport") flags in the TCP IPv4 header.

By default, ECN rules match a packet with the bit set. You can reverse the match by using an explanation point (!).

### Match on the ECE Bit

After an endpoint receives a packet with the [CE](## "Congestion Experienced") bit set by a router, it sets the ECE bit in the returning ACK packet to notify the other endpoint that it needs to slow down.

To match on the ECE bit:

{{< tabs "TabID947 ">}}
{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

Run the `net add acl ipv4 <rule-name> <action> tcp ece` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 ece-rule accept tcp ece
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "iptables rule">}}

Create a rules file in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory and add the following rule under `[iptables]`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/30-tcp-flags.rules
[iptables]
-A FORWARD -i swp1 -p tcp -m ecn --ecn-tcp-ece -j ACCEPT 
```

Apply the rule:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -i
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Match on the CWR Bit

The **CWR** bit notifies the other endpoint of the connection that it received and reacted to an ECE.

To match on the CWR bit:

{{< tabs "TabID915 ">}}
{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

Run the `net add acl ipv4 <rule-name> <action> tcp cwr` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 cwr-rule accept tcp cwr
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "iptables rule ">}}

Create a rules file in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory and add the following rule under `[iptables]`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/30-tcp-flags.rules
[iptables]
-A FORWARD -i swp1 -p tcp -m ecn --ecn-tcp-cwr -j ACCEPT 
```

Apply the rule:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -i
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Match on the ECT Bit

The **ECT** codepoints negotiate if the connection is ECN capable by setting one of the two bits to 1. Routers also use the ECT bit to indicate that they are experiencing congestion by setting both the ECT codepoints to 1.

To match on the ECT bit:

{{< tabs "TabID979 ">}}
{{< tab "NCLU Commands ">}}

Run the `net add acl ipv4 <acl-name> <action> tcp ecn <value>` command. You can specify a value between 0 and 3.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 ect-rule accept tcp ecn 1
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "iptables rule">}}

Create a rules file in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory and add the following rule under `[iptables]`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/30-tcp-flags.rules
[iptables]
-A FORWARD -i swp1 -p tcp -m ecn --ecn-ip-ect 1 -j ACCEPT
```

Apply the rule:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -i
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}
-->

## Example Configuration

The following example demonstrates how Cumulus Linux applies several different rules.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/acl-config-example.png" >}}

### Egress Rule

The following rule blocks any TCP traffic with destination port 200 going through leaf01 to server01 (rule 1 in the diagram above).

```
[iptables]
-A FORWARD -o swp1 -p tcp --dport 200 -j DROP
```

### Ingress Rule

The following rule blocks any UDP traffic with source port 200 going from server01 through leaf01 (rule 2 in the diagram above).

```
[iptables] 
-A FORWARD -i swp1 -p udp --sport 200 -j DROP
```

### Input Rule

The following rule blocks any UDP traffic with source port 200 and destination port 50 going from server02 to the leaf02 control plane (rule 3 in the diagram above).

```
[iptables] 
-A INPUT -i swp2 -p udp --sport 200 --dport 50 -j DROP
```

### Output Rule

The following rule blocks any TCP traffic with source port 123 and destination port 123 going from leaf02 to server02 (rule 4 in the diagram above).

```
[iptables] 
-A OUTPUT -o swp2 -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP
```

### Combined Rules

The following rule blocks any TCP traffic with source port 123 and destination port 123 going from any switch port egress or generated from the switch.

```
[iptables] 
-A OUTPUT,FORWARD -o swp+ -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP
```

This also becomes two ACLs and is the same as:

```
[iptables]
-A FORWARD -o swp+ -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP 
-A OUTPUT -o swp+ -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP
```

### Layer 2 Rules (ebtables)

The following rule blocks any traffic with source MAC address 00:00:00:00:00:12 and destination MAC address 08:9e:01:ce:e2:04 going from any switch port egress or ingress.

## Considerations

### Not All Rules Supported

Cumulus Linux does not support all `iptables`, `ip6tables`, or `ebtables` rules. Refer to {{<link url="#iptables-and-ip6tables-rule-support" text="Supported Rules">}} for specific rule support.

### ACL Log Policer Limits Traffic

To protect the CPU from overloading, Cumulus Linux limits traffic copied to the CPU to 1 packet per second by an ACL Log Policer.

### Bridge Traffic Limitations

Bridge traffic that matches LOG ACTION rules do not log to syslog; the kernel and hardware identify packets using different information.

### You Cannot Forward Log Actions

You cannot forward logged packets. The hardware cannot both forward a packet and send the packet to the control plane (or kernel) for logging. A log action must also have a drop action.

### SPAN Sessions that Reference an Outgoing Interface

SPAN sessions that reference an outgoing interface create mirrored packets based on the ingress interface before the routing decision. See {{<link url="SPAN-and-ERSPAN#span-sessions-that-reference-an-outgoing-interface" text="SPAN Sessions that Reference an Outgoing Interface">}} and {{<link url="SPAN-and-ERSPAN/#use-the-cpu-port-as-the-span-destination" text="Use the CPU Port as the SPAN Destination">}} in the Network Troubleshooting section.

### iptables Interactions with cl-acltool
<!-- vale on -->
Because Cumulus Linux is a Linux operating system, you can use the `iptables` commands. However, consider using `cl-acltool` instead because:

- Without using `cl-acltool`, rules do not install into hardware.
- Running `cl-acltool -i` (the installation command) resets all rules and deletes anything that is not stored in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`.

For example, running the following command works:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP
```

And the rules appear when you run `cl-acltool -L`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -L ip
-------------------------------
Listing rules of type iptables:
-------------------------------
TABLE filter :
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 72 packets, 5236 bytes)
pkts bytes target  prot opt in   out   source    destination

0     0 DROP    icmp --  any  any   anywhere  anywhere      icmp echo-request
```

However, running `cl-acltool -i` or `reboot` removes them. To ensure that Cumulus Linux can hardware accelerate all rules that can be in hardware, place them in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf` file, then run `cl-acltool -i`.

### Hardware Limitations

Due to hardware limitations in the Spectrum ASIC, {{<link url="Bidirectional-Forwarding-Detection-BFD" text="BFD policers">}} and the BFD-related control plane share rules. The following default rules share the same policer in the `00control_plan.rules` file:

```
[iptables]
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_ECHO_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_MH_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000

[ip6tables]
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p udp --dport $BFD_ECHO_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000 --set-class 7
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p udp --dport $BFD_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000 --set-class 7
-A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p udp --dport $BFD_MH_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000 --set-class 7
```

To work around this limitation, set the rate and burst for all these rules to the same values with the `--set-rate` and `--set-burst` options.

### Where to Assign Rules

- If you assign a switch port to a bond, you must assign any egress rules to the bond.
- When using the OUTPUT chain, you must assign rules to the source. For example, if you assign a rule to the switch port in the direction of traffic but the source is a bridge (VLAN), the rule does not affect the traffic and you must applied the rule to the bridge.
- If you need to apply a rule to all transit traffic, use the FORWARD chain, not the OUTPUT chain.

### ACL Rule Installation Failure

After an ACL rule installation failure, you see a generic error message like the following:

```
cumulus@switch:$ sudo cl-acltool -i -p 00control_plane.rules
Using user provided rule file 00control_plane.rules
Reading rule file 00control_plane.rules ...
Processing rules in file 00control_plane.rules ...
error: hw sync failed (sync_acl hardware installation failed)
Installing acl policy... Rolling back ..
failed.
```

### INPUT Chain Rules

Cumulus Linux implements INPUT chain rules using a trap mechanism and assigns trap IDs to packets that go to the CPU. The default INPUT chain rules map to these trap IDs. However, if a packet matches multiple traps, an internal priority mechanism resolves them. which can be different from the rule priorities. The default expected rule does not police the packet but another rule polices it instead. For example, the LOCAL rule polices ICMP packets that go to the CPU instead of the ICMP rule. Also, multiple rules can share the same trap, where the largest of the policer values applies.

To work around this issue, create rules on the INPUT and FORWARD chains (INPUT,FORWARD).

{{%notice note%}}
FORWARD chain rules can drop packets that forward through the switch. Exercise caution when defining these rules and be as specific as possible.
{{%/notice%}}

### Hardware Policing of Packets in the Input Chain

Certain platforms have limitations on hardware policing packets in the INPUT chain. To work around these limitations, Cumulus Linux supports kernel based policing of these packets in software using limit or hashlimit matches. Cumulus Linux does not hardware offload rules with these matches, but ignores them during hardware install.

### ACLs Do not Match when the Output Port on the ACL is a Subinterface

The ACL does not match on packets when you configure a subinterface as the output port. The ACL matches on packets only if the primary port is as an output port. If a subinterface is an output or egress port, the packets match correctly. For example:

```
-A FORWARD --out-interface swp49s1.100 -j ACCEPT
```

### Egress ACL Matching on Bonds

Cumulus Linux does not support ACL rules that match on an outbound *bond* interface. For example, you cannot create the following rule:

```
[iptables]
-A FORWARD --out-interface <bond_intf> -j DROP
```

To work around this issue, duplicate the ACL rule on each physical port of the bond. For example:

```
[iptables]
-A FORWARD --out-interface <bond-member-port-1> -j DROP
-A FORWARD --out-interface <bond-member-port-2> -j DROP
```

### SSH Taffic to the Management VRF

To allow SSH traffic to the management VRF, use `-i mgmt`, not `-i eth0`. For example:

```
-A INPUT -i mgmt -s 10.0.14.2/32 -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
```
<!-- vale off -->
### INPUT Chain Rules and swp+
<!-- vale on -->
In INPUT chain rules, the `--in-interface swp+` match works only if the destination of the packet is towards a layer 3 swp interface; the match does not work if the packet terminates at an SVI interface (for example, vlan10). To allow traffic towards specific SVIs, use rules without any interface match or rules with individual `--in-interface <SVI>` matches.
