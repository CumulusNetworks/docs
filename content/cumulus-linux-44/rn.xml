<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.
To disable scp completely, use {{/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp}} .</td>

<td>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:
-The user is authorized to {{scp}} but not {{ssh}} (based on the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses {{scp -r}} to copy over to the target computer.
Be aware that restricting users to {{scp}} by using the {{command}} option in the {{authorized_keys}} file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.
If you want to use {{scp -r}} to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with {{tar}}, {{zip}}, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use {{scp -r}} altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides {{sftp}}, which you can use instead of {{scp}} to copy files.
To disable scp completely, use {{/bin/chmod 0 /usr/bin/scp}} .</td>

<td>The following vulnerabilities have been announced in the openssl packages:
CVE-2021-23840: Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
CVE-2021-23841: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
CVE-2019-1551: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.
