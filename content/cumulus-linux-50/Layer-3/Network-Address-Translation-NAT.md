Network Address Translation (NAT) enables your network to use one set of IP addresses for internal traffic and a second set of addresses for external traffic.

NAT overcomes addressing problems due to the explosive growth of the Internet. In addition to preventing the depletion of IPv4 addresses, NAT enables you to use the private address space internally and still have a way to access the Internet.

Cumulus Linux supports both static NAT and dynamic NAT. Static NAT provides a permanent mapping between one private IP address and a single public address. Dynamic NAT maps private IP addresses to public addresses; these public IP addresses come from a pool. Cumulus Linux creates the translations as needed dynamically, so that a large number of private addresses can share a smaller pool of public addresses.

Static and dynamic NAT both support:

- Basic NAT, which only translates the IP address in the packet: the source IP address in the outbound direction and the destination IP address in the inbound direction.
- Port Address Translation (PAT), which translates both the IP address and layer 4 port: the source IP address and port in the outbound direction and the destination IP address and port in the inbound direction.

Static NAT supports double NAT (also known as twice NAT) where the switch translates both the source and destination IP addresses as a packet crosses address realms. You use double NAT when the address space in a private network overlaps with IP addresses in the public space.

The following illustration shows a basic NAT configuration.

{{%notice note%}}
- NVIDIA Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 switches only support NAT.
- You can configure NAT on physical and bond interfaces only; logical interfaces such as the loopback, SVIs, and subinterfaces do not support NAT.
- You can only configure NAT in the default VRF.
- You can enable both static NAT and dynamic NAT at the same time.
- You cannot translate IPv6 rules to IPv4 rules.
- NAT does not support multicast traffic.
- You cannot use NAT in an EVPN configuration.

## Static NAT

Static NAT provides a one-to-one mapping between a private IP address inside your network and a public IP address. For example, if you have a web server with the private IP address 10.0.0.10 and you want a remote host to make a request to the web server using the IP address 172.30.58.80, you configure a static NAT mapping between the two IP addresses.

Static NAT entries do not time out from the translation table.

### Enable Static NAT

To enable static NAT, edit the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` file and uncomment the `nat.static_enable = TRUE` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.conf
...
# NAT configuration
# Enables NAT
nat.static_enable = TRUE
...
```

Then restart `switchd`.
<!-- vale off -->
{{<cl/restart-switchd>}}
<!-- vale on -->
{{%notice note%}}
Other options in the NAT configuration section of the `switchd.conf` file, such as `nat.age_poll_interval` and `nat.table_size` are dynamic NAT configuration options and are not supported with static NAT.

### Configure Static NAT

For static **NAT**, create a rule that matches a source or destination IP address and translates the IP address to a public IP address.

For static **PAT**, create a rule that matches a source or destination IP address together with the layer 4 port and translates the IP address and port to a public IP address and port.

For NVIDIA switches with Spectrum-2 and later, you can include the outgoing or incoming interface.

To create rules, use `cl-acltool`.

To add NAT rules using `cl-acltool`, either edit an existing file in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory and add rules under `[iptables]` or create a new file in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory and add rules under an `[iptables]` section. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/60_nat.rules
[iptables]

 #Add rule
 ```

**Example Rules**

The following rule matches TCP packets with source IP address 10.0.01 and translates the IP address to 172.30.58.80:

```
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.1 -p tcp -j SNAT --to-source 172.30.58.80
```

The following rule matches ICMP packets with destination IP address 172.30.58.80 on interface swp51 and translates the IP address to 10.0.0.1

```
-t nat -A PREROUTING -d 172.30.58.80 -p icmp --in-interface swp51 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.1
```

The following rule matches UDP packets with source IP address 10.0.0.1 and source port 5000, and translates the IP address to 172.30.58.80 and the port to 6000.

```
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.1 -p udp --sport 5000 -j SNAT --to-source 172.30.58.80:6000
```

The following rule matches UDP packets with destination IP address 172.30.58.80 and destination port 6000 on interface swp51, and translates the IP address to 10.0.0.1 and the port to 5000.

```
-t nat -A PREROUTING -d 172.30.58.80 -p udp --dport 6000 --in-interface swp51  -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.1:5000
```

The following *double NAT* rule translates both the source and destination IP addresses of incoming and outgoing ICMP packets:  
- For outgoing messages, NAT changes the inside local IP address 172.16.10.2 to the inside global IP address 130.1.100.10 and the outside local IP address 26.26.26.26 to the outside global IP address 140.1.1.2.
- For incoming messages, NAT changes the inside global IP address 130.1.100.10 to the inside local IP address 172.16.10.2 and the outside global IP address 140.1.1.2 to the outside local IP address 26.26.26.26.

```
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.10.2 -p icmp -j SNAT --to-source 130.1.100.100
-t nat -A PREROUTING -d 130.1.100.100 -p icmp -j DNAT --to-destination 172.16.10.2
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 140.1.1.2 -p icmp -j SNAT --to-source 26.26.26.26 
-t nat -A PREROUTING -d 26.26.26.26 -p icmp -j DNAT --to-destination 140.1.1.2 
```

{{%notice note%}}
When you configure a static SNAT rule for outgoing traffic, you must also configure a static DNAT rule for the reverse traffic so that traffic goes in both directions.
{{%/notice%}}

To delete a static NAT rule, remove the rule from the policy file in the  `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory, then run the `sudo cl-acltool -i command`.

## Dynamic NAT

Dynamic NAT maps private IP addresses and ports to a public IP address and port range or a public IP address range and port range. Cumulus Linux assigns IP addresses from a pool of addresses dynamically. When the switch releases entries after a period of inactivity, it maps new incoming connections dynamically to the freed up addresses and ports.

### Enable Dynamic NAT

To enable dynamic NAT, edit the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` file and uncomment the `nat.dynamic_enable = TRUE` option:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.conf
...
# NAT configuration
# Enables NAT
nat.dynamic_enable = TRUE
...
```

Then restart `switchd`.
<!-- vale off -->
{{<cl/restart-switchd>}}
<!-- vale on -->
### Optional Dynamic NAT Settings

The `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` file includes the following configuration options for dynamic NAT. Only change these options if you enable dynamic NAT.
<!-- vale off -->
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| nat.age_poll_interval | The period of inactivity before `switchd` releases a NAT entry from the translation table.<br>The default value is 5 minutes. The minimum value is 1 minute. The maximum value is 24 hours.|
| nat.table_size | The maximum number of dynamic `snat` and `dnat` entries in the translation table. The default value is 1024.<br>NVIDIA Spectrum-2 switches support a maximum of 8192 entries. |
| nat.config_table_size | The maximum number of rules allowed.<br>The default value is 64. The minimum value is 64. The maximum value for the NVIDIA Spectrum-2 switch is 1024. The maximum value for the NVIDIA Spectrum-3 switch is 8192. |
<!-- vale on -->
After you change any of the dynamic NAT configuration options, restart `switchd`.
<!-- vale off -->
{{<cl/restart-switchd>}}
<!-- vale on -->
### Configure Dynamic NAT

For dynamic **NAT**, create a rule that matches a IP address in CIDR notation and translates the address to a public IP address or IP address range.

For dynamic **PAT**, create a rule that matches an IP address in CIDR notation and translates the address to a public IP address and port range or an IP address range and port range. You can also match on an IP address in CIDR notation and port.

For NVIDIA Spectrum-2 switches, you can include the outgoing or incoming interface in the rule. See the examples below.

To add NAT rules using `cl-acltool`, either edit an existing file in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory and add rules under `[iptables]` or create a new file in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory and add rules under an `[iptables]` section. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/60_nat.rules
[iptables]

 #Add rule
```

**Example Rules**

The following rule matches TCP packets with source IP address in the range 10.0.0.0/24 on outbound interface swp5 and translates the address dynamically to an IP address in the range 172.30.58.0-172.30.58.80.

```
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 --out-interface swp5 -p tcp -j SNAT --to-source 172.30.58.0-172.30.58.80
```

The following rule matches UDP packets with source IP address in the range 10.0.0.0/24 and translates the addresses dynamically to IP address 172.30.58.80 with layer 4 ports in the range 1024-1200:

```
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -p udp -j SNAT --to-source 172.30.58.80:1024-1200
```

The following rule matches UDP packets with source IP address in the range 10.0.0.0/24 on source port 5000 and translates the addresses dynamically to IP address 172.30.58.80 with layer 4 ports in the range 1024-1200:

```
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -p udp --sport 5000 -j SNAT --to-source 172.30.58.80:1024-1200
```

The following rule matches TCP packets with destination IP address in the range 10.1.0.0/24 and translates the address dynamically to IP address range 172.30.58.0-172.30.58.80 with layer 4 ports in the range 1024-1200:

```
-t nat -A PREROUTING -d 10.1.0.0/24 -p tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 172.30.58.0-172.30.58.80:1024-1200
```

The following rule matches ICMP packets with source IP address in the range 10.0.0.0/24 and destination IP address in the range 10.1.0.0/24. The rule translates the address dynamically to IP address range 172.30.58.0-172.30.58.80 with layer 4 ports in the range 1024-1200:

```
-t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d 10.1.0.0/24 -p icmp -j SNAT --to-source 172.30.58.0-172.30.58.80:1024-1200
```

To delete a dynamic NAT rule, remove the rule from the policy file in the  `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d` directory, then run the `sudo cl-acltool -i` command.

## Show Configured NAT Rules

To see the NAT rules configured on the switch, run the `sudo iptables -t nat -v -L` or the
`sudo cl-acltool -L ip -v` command. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo iptables -t nat -v -L -n
...
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT 27 packets, 3249 bytes)
 pkts bytes target   prot opt in   out   source      destination
    0     0 SNAT     tcp --  any  any   10.0.0.1    anywhere     to:172.30.58.80
```

## Show Conntrack Flows

To see the active connection tracking (conntrack) flows, run the `sudo cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack` command. The hardware offloaded flows contain `[OFFLOAD]` in the output.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack
ipv4     2 udp      17 src=172.30.10.5 dst=10.0.0.2 sport=5001 dport=5000 src=10.0.0.2 dst=10.1.0.10 sport=6000 dport=1026 [OFFLOAD] mark=0 zone=0 use=2
```

## Considerations

When using NAT, you must enable proxy ARP for intra-subnet ARP requests when:
- The addresses you define in the static NAT and source NAT pool are in the same subnet as the ingress interface.
- The addresses in the original destination address entry in the destination NAT rules are in the same subnet as the ingress interface.

To enable proxy ARP for intra-subnet ARP requests:

{{< tab "NVUE Commands ">}}

Cumulus Linux does not provide NVUE commands for this setting.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to set `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<interface>/proxy_arp_pvlan` to `1` in the interface stanza, then run the `ifreload -a` command.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
...
auto swp1
iface swp1
    post-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/swp1/proxy_arp_pvlan
...
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
```
