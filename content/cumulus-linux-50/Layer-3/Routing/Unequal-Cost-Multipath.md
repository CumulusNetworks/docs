Unequal Cost Multipath (UCMP) is deployed in data center networks that rely on anycast routing to provide network-based load balancing. Cumulus Linux supports UCMP by using the BGP link bandwidth extended community to load balance traffic towards anycast services for IPv4 and IPv6 routes in a layer 3 deployment and for prefix (type-5) routes in an EVPN deployment.

## UCMP Routing

In ECMP, the route to a destination has multiple next hops and traffic is equally distributed across them. Flow-based hashing is used so that all traffic associated with a particular flow uses the same next hop and the same path across the network.

In UCMP, along with the ECMP flow-based hash, a weight is associated with each next hop and traffic is distributed across the next hops in proportion to their weight. Cumulus Linux relies on the BGP link bandwidth extended community to carry information about the anycast server distribution through the network; this is mapped to the weight of the corresponding next hop. This mapping is a factoring of a particular pathâ€™s bandwidth value against the total bandwidth values of all possible paths, mapped to the range 1 to 100. There is no change to either the BGP best path selection algorithm or to the multipath computation algorithm that determines which paths can be used for load balancing.

## UCMP Example

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ucmp-example.png" >}}

The above example shows how traffic towards 192.168.10.1/32 is load balanced when you use UCMP routing:

- Leaf01 has two ECMP paths to 192.168.10.1/32 (via Server01 and Server03) whereas Leaf03 and Leaf04 have a single path to Server04.
- Leaf01, Leaf02, Leaf03, and Leaf04 are configured to generate BGP link bandwidth based on the number of BGP multipaths for a prefix.
- When announcing the prefix to the spines, Leaf01 and Leaf02 generate a link bandwidth of two while Leaf03 and Leaf04 generate a link bandwidth of one.
- Each spine advertises the 192.168.10.1/32 prefix to the border leafs with an accumulated bandwidth of 6. This combines the value of 2 from Leaf01, 2 from Leaf02, 1 from Leaf03 and 1 from Leaf04.

Now, each spine has four UCMP routes:

- through Leaf01 with weight 2
- through Leaf02 with weight 2
- through Leaf03 with weight 1
- through Leaf04 with weight 1

The border leafs also have four UCMP routes:

- through Spine01 with weight 6
- through Spine02 with weight 6
- through Spine03 with weight 6
- through Spine04 with weight 6

The border leafs balance traffic equally; all weights are equal to the spines. Only the spines have unequal load sharing based on the weight values.

## Configure UCMP

Use the `set extcommunity bandwidth num-multipaths` command in a route map to set the extended community against all prefixes, or against a specific or set of prefixes using the match clause of the route map. Apply the route map at the first device to receive the prefix; against the BGP neighbor that generated this prefix.

The BGP link bandwidth extended community is encoded in bytes-per-second. To convert the number of ECMP paths, a reference bandwidth of 1024Kbps is used. For example, if there are four ECMP paths to an anycast IP, the encoded bandwidth in the extended community is 512,000. The actual value is not important, as long as all routers originating the link bandwidth are converting the number of ECMP paths in the same way.

Cumulus Linux accepts the bandwidth extended community by default. No additional configuration is required on transit devices where UCMP routes are not being originated.

{{%notice note%}}
- The bandwidth used in the extended community has no impact on or relation to port bandwidth.
- You can only apply the route weight information on the outbound direction to a peer; you cannot apply route weight information on the inbound direction from peers advertising routes to the switch.

## Control UCMP on the Receiving Switch

To control UCMP on the receiving switch, you can:

- Set default values for UCMP routes.
- Disable the advertisement of all BGP extended communities on specific peerings.

### Set Default Values for UCMP Routes

By default, if some of the multipaths do not have link bandwidth, Cumulus Linux ignores the bestpath bandwidth value in any of the multipaths and performs ECMP. However, you can set one of the following options instead:

- Ignore link bandwidth completely and perform ECMP.
- Skip paths without link bandwidth and perform UCMP among the others (if at least some paths have link bandwidth).
- Assign a low default weight (value 1) to paths that do not have link bandwidth.

Change this setting per BGP instance for both IPv4 and IPv6 unicast routes in the BGP instance. For EVPN, set the options on the tenant VRF.

Either run the NCLU `net add bestpath bandwidth ignore|skip-missing|default-weight-for-missing` command or the `vtysh` `bgp bestpath bandwidth ignore|skip-missing|default-weight-for-missing` command.

The following commands set link bandwidth processing to skip paths without link bandwidth and perform UCMP among the other paths:

switch(config-router)# bgp bestpath bandwidth skip-missing
switch(config-router)# end
switch# write memory
switch# exit
cumulus@switch:~$
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

The NCLU and `vtysh` commands save the configuration in the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file. For example:

```
router bgp 65011
  bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
  neighbor LEAF peer-group
  neighbor LEAF remote-as external
  neighbor swp1 interface peer-group LEAF
  neighbor swp2 interface peer-group LEAF
  neighbor swp3 interface peer-group LEAF
  neighbor swp4 interface peer-group LEAF
  bgp bestpath bandwidth skip-missing
!
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    network 10.0.0.1/32
  exit-address-family
 ...
 ```

### BGP Link Bandwidth Outside a Domain

The BGP link bandwidth extended community is automatically passed on with the prefix to eBGP peers. If you do not want to pass on the BGP link bandwidth extended community outside of a particular domain, you can disable the advertisement of all BGP extended communities on specific peerings.

{{%notice note%}}
You cannot disable just the BGP link bandwidth extended community from being advertised to a neighbor; you either send all BGP extended communities, or none.
{{%/notice%}}

To disable all BGP extended communities on a peer or peer group (per address family), either run the NCLU `net del bgp neighbor <neighbor> send-community extended` command or the `vtysh` `no neighbor <neighbor> send-community extended` command:

{{< tabs "TabID295 ">}}

```

{{< tab "vtysh Commands ">}}

switch(config-router)# end
switch# write memory
switch# exit
cumulus@switch:~$
```

## Troubleshooting

To show the extended community in a received or local route, run the NCLU `net show bgp` command or the `vtysh` `show bgp` command.

The following example shows that an IPv4 unicast route is received with the BGP link bandwidth attribute from two peers. The link bandwidth extended community is encoded in bytes-per-second and shown in Mbps per second: `Extended Community: LB:65002:131072000 (1000.000 Mbps) and Extended Community: LB:65001:65536000 (500.000 Mbps)`.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show bgp ipv4 unicast 192.168.10.1/32

```

{{%notice note%}}
The bandwidth value used by UCMP is only to determine the percentage of load to a given next hop and has no impact on actual link or flow bandwidth.
{{%/notice%}}

To show EVPN type-5 routes, run the NCLU `net show bgp l2vpn evpn route type prefix` command or the `vtysh` `show bgp l2vpn evpn route type prefix` command.

The bandwidth is displayed both in the way it is carried in the extended community (as bytes-per-second - unsigned 32 bits) as well as in Gbps, Mbps, or Kbps. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show bgp l2vpn evpn route type prefix
BGP table version is 1, local router ID is 10.0.0.11
Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, i - internal
Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete
...
*> [5]:[0]:[32]:[192.168.10.1]
            10.0.0.5                           0 65100 65050 65200 i
            RT:65050:104001 LB:65050:134217728 (1.000 Gbps) ET:8 Rmac:36:4f:15:ea:81:90
```

To see weights associated with next hops for a route with multiple paths, run the NCLU `net show route` command or the `vtysh` `show ip route` command. For example:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show route 192.168.10.1/32
Routing entry for 192.168.10.1/32
  Known via "bgp", distance 20, metric 0, best
  Last update 00:00:32 ago
  * fe80::202:ff:fe00:1b, via swp2, weight 66
  * fe80::202:ff:fe00:15, via swp1, weight 33
```

## Considerations

UCMP with BGP link bandwidth is only available for BGP-learned routes.
