This documentation includes pre-built Try It demos for certain Cumulus Linux features that run a simulation in NVIDIA Air; a cloud hosted platform that behaves exactly like a real world production deployment. All the pre-built Try It demos use the NVIDIA Cumulus Linux reference topology.

To access a demo, click the **Try It** tab:

The NVIDIA Air starts building the simulation and boots the nodes:

When the simulation is ready, you can log into the leaf and spine switches. Use the commands listed under the simulation to test the configuration.

If you want to save the simulation or extend the time, click **LAUNCH IN AIR** to access the network simulation platform. From this platform, you can run additional pre-build demos and even build your own simulations. Refer to [NVIDIA Air User Guide]({{<ref "/guides/nvidia-air" >}}).
