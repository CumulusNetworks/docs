This documentation includes pre-built Try It demos for certain Cumulus Linux features that run a simulation in NVIDIA Air; a cloud hosted platform that behaves exactly like a real world production deployment. All the pre-built *Try It* demos use the NVIDIA Cumulus Linux reference topology.

To access a demo, click the **Try It** tab:

When the simulation is ready, you can log into the leaf and spine switches. Use the commands listed under the simulation to test the configuration.
