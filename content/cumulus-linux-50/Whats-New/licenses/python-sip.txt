 1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between Riverbank Computing Limited ("Riverbank"),
 and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using

 hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to
 reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative
 works, distribute, and otherwise use SIP alone or in any derivative version,
 provided, however, that Riverbank's License Agreement and Riverbank's notice of
 copyright, e.g., "Copyright (c) 2014 Riverbank Computing Limited; All Rights
 Reserved" are retained in SIP alone or in any derivative version prepared by
 Licensee.
 .
 3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
 incorporates SIP or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative work
 available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees to include
 in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to SIP.

 6. RIVERBANK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF SIP FOR ANY
 INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF MODIFYING,

 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
 .
 7. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach
 of its terms and conditions.
