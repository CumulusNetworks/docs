Copyright: Public domain
License: public-domain
 The persons who have associated their work with this project (the
 "Dedicator": David Goodger and the many contributors to the Docutils
 project) hereby dedicate the entire copyright, less the exceptions_
 listed below, in the work of authorship known as "Docutils" identified
 below (the "Work") to the public domain.
 .
 The primary repository for the Work is the Internet World Wide Web
 site <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>.  The Work consists of the
 files within the "docutils" module of the Docutils project Subversion
 repository (Internet host docutils.svn.sourceforge.net, filesystem path
 /svnroot/docutils), whose Internet web interface is located at
 <http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/>.  Files dedicated to the
 public domain may be identified by the inclusion, near the beginning
 of each file, of a declaration of the form::
 .
     Copyright: This document/module/DTD/stylesheet/file/etc. has been
                placed in the public domain.
 .
 Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large
 and to the detriment of Dedicator's heirs and successors.  Dedicator
 intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in
 perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law,
 whether vested or contingent, in the Work.  Dedicator understands that
 such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all
 rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
 Work.
 .
 Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work
 may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
 built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose,
 commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods
 that have not yet been invented or conceived.
