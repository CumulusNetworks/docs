 This Meschach Library is provided "as is" without any express 
 or implied warranty of any kind with respect to this software. 
 In particular the authors shall not be liable for any direct, 
 indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising 
 in any way from use of the software.
 .
 Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute this
 Meschach Library, provided:
  1.  All copies contain this copyright notice.
  2.  All modified copies shall carry a notice stating who
      made the last modification and the date of such modification.
  3.  No charge is made for this software or works derived from it.  
      This clause shall not be construed as constraining other software
      distributed on the same medium as this software, nor is a
      distribution fee considered a charge.
Comment:
 This license is almost permissive but partially copyleft.  The "No charge"
 clause prohibits a fee for the right to use this software or works derived
 from it, that conflicts with merging into a proprietary software for a fee,
 but a distribution fee and a commercial use are okay, compliant to DFSG.
