<td>FRR does not apply Type-0 ESI configuration for EVPN multihoming bonds consistently after an FRR service reload. This issue occurs because the system MAC address value ({{es-sys-mac}} is only compatible with a 3-byte Ethernet segment ID ({{es-id}}) for Type-3 ESIs, but still renders even when the Ethernet segment ID is 10 bytes for Type-0 ESIs. To work around this issue, configure EVPN multihoming bonds with a Type-3 ESI ({{es-sys-mac}} plus a 3-byte {{es-id}}).</td>

<td>When you remove the restriction from a TACACS+ mapped user to remove per command authorization, the {{tacplus-restrict -R}} command does not restore ownership of restored files correctly. As a result, some commands might fail due to permission errors in the files or directories under the home directory. To work around this issue, run the {{sudo chown}} command  to correct the ownership of the affected files and directories.</td>

<td>To reach the TACACS+ server through the default VRF, you must specify the egress interface you use in the default VRF. Either run the NVUE {{nv set system aaa tacacs vrf &lt;interface&gt;}} command (for example, {{nv set system aaa tacacs vrf swp51}}) or set the {{vrf=&lt;interface&gt;}} option in the {{/etc/tacplus_servers}} file (for example, {{vrf=swp51}}). A similar issue might prevent TACACS+ users with privilege level 15 from using {{sudo}} if the TACACS+ server is reachable only on the {{default}} VRF.  If this occurs, and you do not run the above configuration workaround, the TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can use {{vrf task exec default sudo ...}} to execute the {{sudo}} command using the TACACS+ server on the {{default}} VRF.</td>
