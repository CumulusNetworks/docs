<td><p>OpenSSH scp is vulnerable to CVE-2020-15778, where clients that have authorized access to the SSH server can execute commands on the server by copying maliciously named files.<br/>
The two scenarios where an exploit may be useful to an attacker:<br/>
-The user is authorized to scp but not ssh (based on the command option in the authorized_keys file), so this vulnerability can allow executing a remote command on the target computer when not authorized to do so.<br/>
-An attacker plants a maliciously named file in a directory tree that someone later uses scp -r to copy over to the target computer.<br/>
Be aware that restricting users to scp by using the command option in the authorized_keys file is not effective in preventing those users from executing arbitrary commands on the server.<br/>
If you want to use scp -r to copy directory trees, avoid copying directory trees to which attackers may have added maliciously-named files. Archiving the directory tree with tar, zip, or a similar program, then copying the archive over to be extracted on the server avoids having to use scp -r altogether. In addition, OpenSSH provides sftp, which you can use instead of scp to copy files.<br/>

This can allow a static fdb entry to be unexpectedly learned dynamically on a different interface, or can prevent a dynamic entry from being updated or learned elsewhere.<br/>
This condition can occur during a manual replacement of a local MAC address or when EVPN updates a dynamic MAC address to add or remove the Sticky Mac flag. Either situation results in the MAC address keeping the original flag in hardware.<br/>
To work around this issue, delete or withdraw the fdb entry, then add the static MAC address directly. For example:</p>

bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master
bridge fdb add 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master [ static | dynamic ]


<p>If you are unable to delete an EVPN-learned remote MAC address, you can replace the dynamic MAC address with a local static one, then delete the static MAC address. For example:</p>

bridge fdb replace 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master static
bridge fdb del 50:6b:4b:ee:ee:ee dev swp31 vlan 24 master

<td><p>In vtysh, if you configure, then remove a layer 3 VNI for a VRF, the VNI is removed from zebra even if the VNI interface still exists in the kernel.<br/>
If you configure a layer 2 VNI as a layer 3 VNI by mistake, removing the layer 3 VNI binding removes it from zebra but EVPN-learned MACs and neighbors are not installed into the kernel.<br/>
To work around this issue, delete, then re-add the missing VNI. For example:</p>

cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifdown vni10100
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifup vni10100


<p>If you flap the link with the ip link set vni10100 down; ip link set vni10100 up commands, zebra does not re-add the VNI.</p></td>
