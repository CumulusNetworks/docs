<td>On Mellanox Spectrum switches, when there is an MSTP forwarding state change on a bonds (for example, when the state changes from blocking to forwarding), the MSTP hardware table might set some VLANs to blocking when they should be forwarding. A a result, all packets on these VLANs drop at ingress.
To recover from this state, flap the bond interface (not the physical swp) by running {{ifdown &lt;bond_name&gt; ; sleep 1 ; ifup &lt;bond_name&gt;}}.</td>

<td>If you apply an outbound route map to a BGP peer that uses {{set as-path prepend last-as}}, advertised locally-originated routes have the ASN of the peer prepended to the AS path.
This might trigger AS path loop prevention on the peer, where the peer ignores locally-originated prefixes.</td>
