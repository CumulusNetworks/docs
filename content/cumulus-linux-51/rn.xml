<td>When you use the NVUE command {{nv set interface lo router ospf area}} to configure OSPF on a loopback interface, the configuration fails to apply.
To work around this issue, configure the loopback interface in the desired OSPF area with the {{nv set vrf default router ospf area 0 network}} command and reference the assigned prefix of the loopback interface. For example:

cumulus@leaf01:~$ nv set vrf default router ospf area 0 network 10.10.10.1/32
