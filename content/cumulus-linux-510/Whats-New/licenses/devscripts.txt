License: Artistic
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the Artistic License, which comes with Perl.
 .
 On Debian systems, the complete text of the Artistic License can be
 found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/Artistic'.

License: Artistic-2.0
 Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
     Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided
     that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
     Standard Version of this Package in any medium without
     restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided
     that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
     associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies
     may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
     modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The
     resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version,
     and as such will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
     or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of
     the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it
     differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to,
     documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules,
     and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
    (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that
        the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the
        Standard Version.
    (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version.
        In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is
        different from the name of the Standard Version.
    (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to
        others under
        (i)  the Original License or
        (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
             modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the
             same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the
             licensee received, and requires that the Source form of
             the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
             be made freely available in that license fees are
             prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
     the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on
     how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions
     must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these
     instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such
     distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions
     on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid
     instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you
     become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not
     forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
     the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect
     to the Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
     Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the
     resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing
     fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing
     fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The
     terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the
     Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
     other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own,
     or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of
     applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result
     without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct
     interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
     merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves,
     cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such
     works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are
     not subject to the terms of this license.
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
      Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By
      using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this
      license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you
      do not accept this license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
      Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless
      required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with
      the requirements of this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
      service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
      free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
      sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to
      any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are
      necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent
      litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against
      any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or
      contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to
      you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.
 .

      HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE
