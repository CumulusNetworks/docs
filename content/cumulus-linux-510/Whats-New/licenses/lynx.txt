  == from COPYHEADER ==
 Copyright 1997-2014,2015 Thomas E. Dickey
 .
 This copyright notice must be included in all copies or substantial
 portions of Lynx.  It outlines rights and restrictions for Lynx which
 override the guidelines given in the COPYING file.
 .
 Most of the content of the Lynx release (and corresponding copyright) is
 the work of developers on the lynx-dev mailing list, who have agreed to
 distribute their work under the terms and conditions of the GNU General
 Public License (Version 2).  Note that the License text after the terms
 and conditions is advisory in nature, and contains neither terms nor
 conditions.  You may choose to follow that advice.
 .
 The copyright owners and developers for Lynx grant their express
 permission for using any version of these common libraries (which are
 known to have problematic licensing issues) with any operating system or
 platform, irregardless of the manner in which the libraries are
 connected to the Lynx program:
 .
        GNUTLS
 .
        libbsd               https://libbsd.freedesktop.org/releases/
 .
        libidn
 .
        OpenSSL              https://www.openssl.org/
 .
 Additionally, the developers understand that these additional libraries
 have no licensing issues.  Permission is in any case granted to use Lynx
 without restriction for these as well:
 .
        libbz2               http://www.bzip.org/
 .
        libiconv
 .
        libutf8              https://www.haible.de/bruno/packages-libutf8.html
 .
        nss_compat_ossl      https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Nss_compat_ossl
 .
        zlib                 http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
 .
 The list given is by no means exhaustive and may not be interpreted to
 limit the set of libraries with which Lynx can be used.
 .
 The granted right to "use" (besides the obvious ability to run the
 program as a user) covers all development activities such as of building,
 modifying, distributing modified versions.
 .
 Any licensing questions should be directed to the mailing list:
 .
        lynx-dev@nongnu.org
 .
 or to the developer/maintainer (Thomas E. Dickey):
 .
        dickey@invisible-island.net
