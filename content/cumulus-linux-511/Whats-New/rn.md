| <a name="4548514"></a> [4548514](#4548514) <a name="4548514"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, and so on.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.9.1-5.14.0 | |

| <a name="4540976"></a> [4540976](#4540976) <a name="4540976"></a> <br /> | When an SVI interface is brought up with routes installed against it, during subsequent interface updates that are applied to the interface during bringup such as MTU changes, interface forwarding state, MAC learning updates, or multicast forwarding state changes, the routes installed for the interface might be programmed as blackhole routes. This can occur during a fresh boot of a switch. To work around this issue, toggle the interface state of the SVI.  | 5.8.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4535804"></a> [4535804](#4535804) <a name="4535804"></a> <br /> | If you use a bridge name other than <code>br_default</code>, PTP neighbors fail to establish because the PTP packets are sourced from an unexpected IP address.<br>To work around this issue, configure the <code>base-interface</code> for the VLAN interface with the <code>nv set interface <VLAN-id> base-interface <interface-id></code> command. | 5.10.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535749"></a> [4535749](#4535749) <a name="4535749"></a> <br /> | The <code>uc-discards</code> field in the <code>nv show interface <interface> counters qos egress-queue-stats</code> command output is actually the number of packets discarded per queue, but it is wrongly interpreted as bytes. To work around this issue, convert the data shown in bytes to packets by multiplying by 1024 if the data is in KB, 1024x1024 if the data is in MB, and 1024x1024x1024 if the data is in GB. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535748"></a> [4535748](#4535748) <a name="4535748"></a> <br /> | The <code>uc-discards</code> field in the <code>nv show interface <interface> counters qos egress-queue-stats</code> command output is actually the number of packets discarded per queue, but it is wrongly interpreted as bytes.

| <a name="4522594"></a> [4522594](#4522594) <a name="4522594"></a> <br /> | In a VXLAN environment, if the bridge MAC address changes for a VTEP, the switch drops VXLAN traffic entering this VTEP from a remote VTEP. The switch only drops layer 3 routed VXLAN traffic because the RMAC is not updated correctly in the SDK. | 5.11.1-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4521203"></a> [4521203](#4521203) <a name="4521203"></a> <br /> | The SATA driver on the NVIDIA SN2410 switch sometimes exhibits failures similar to the following:<br><pre>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785966+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: <br>&#91;49878794.456350&#93; ata1.00: failed command: WRITE FPDMA QUEUED<br>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785968+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: &#91;49878794.461984&#93; ata1.00: cmd<br>61/08:08:50:2b:c4/00:00:01:00:00/40 tag 1 ncq dma 4096 out<br>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785970+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: &#91;49878794.461984&#93; res 40/00:0c:50:2b:c4/00:00:01:00:00/40 Emask 0×10 (ATA bus error)</pre><br>To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. | 5.5.1-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4508830"></a> [4508830](#4508830) <a name="4508830"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux allows you to add bond ports of mismatched speeds (such as 10G and 25G) to the same LACP bond without error and the bond reports UP.  | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4507163"></a> [4507163](#4507163) <a name="4507163"></a> <br /> | In some cases after a package upgrade with ISSU (warm boot mode), you see continuous errors in the syslog similar to the following:<br><pre>NOTICE  CORE_ASYNC: Error at pre send callback status &#91;Resource is in use&#93;</pre> | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4505138"></a> [4505138](#4505138) <a name="4505138"></a> <br /> | Transceiver OIR (removal and insertion) or link flaps might cause EMAD timeouts, eventually causing <code>switchd</code> to crash. You see logs similar to <code>EMAD_TRANSACTION&#93; &#91;ERROR &#93;: ACCESS_REG TIMEOUT</code>. | 5.6.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4499106"></a> [4499106](#4499106) <a name="4499106"></a> <br /> | A newly provisioned dynamic BGP neighbour with an MD5 password in a VRF does not come up until you delete, then re-add the password. | 5.9.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4499025"></a> [4499025](#4499025) <a name="4499025"></a> <br /> | You see a high volume of NAT and NFCT errors flooding <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue has no functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4495231"></a> [4495231](#4495231) <a name="4495231"></a> <br /> | If the hardware clock date is later than 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, the image might fail to install due to a grub-install failure on the EFI filesystem, which is a VFAT filesystem.  As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.  You can then use <code>onie-nos-install</code> to install the image. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4486200"></a> [4486200](#4486200) <a name="4486200"></a> <br /> | If you enable dynamic NAT and try to install two identical dynamic NAT rules, <code>switchd</code> might crash. | 5.11.2-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4475111"></a> [4475111](#4475111) <a name="4475111"></a> <br /> | When you try to convert a layer 3 port that is part of ECMP to a bond member,  you might see a failure in the <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue does not have any functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4472414"></a> [4472414](#4472414) <a name="4472414"></a> <br /> | After you modify the IP address of an SVI, DHCP relay uses an old cached IP address instead of the changed IP address. This occurs because DHCP relay monitors the link state change not IP address change. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4469498"></a> [4469498](#4469498) <a name="4469498"></a> <br /> | When a host moves to a new VTEP during mobility or network failover events in an EVPN multihoming environment, the host might be unreachable due to ARP resolution failures. To work around this issue, restart the FRR service with the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command. | 5.4.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4461102"></a> [4461102](#4461102) <a name="4461102"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, when a port is down and you apply adaptive routing with the link utilization threshold setting to the port as it goes up, you might see log errors while the port is not yet up. | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4423352"></a> [4423352](#4423352) <a name="4423352"></a> <br /> | ZTP scripts return an error due to incorrect ASCI to UTF-8 conversion. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423335"></a> [4423335](#4423335) <a name="4423335"></a> <br /> | When you configure TACACS with NVUE or merge in an NVUE configuration file including TACACS configuration with the <code>nv config patch</code> command, you see an unrecoverable error when running additional NVUE commands. To work around this issue, restart the NVUE service with the <code>systemctl restart nvued.service</code> command. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423277"></a> [4423277](#4423277) <a name="4423277"></a> <br /> | When the username in a 802.1X session includes the equals (=) character, the ISSU warmboot fails. Make sure that = is not part of the 802.1X session name. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423269"></a> [4423269](#4423269) <a name="4423269"></a> <br /> | When you configure the switch to move to warm restart mode, the message does not clearly indicate that the reboot to get the switch into warm mode is not hitless. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423248"></a> [4423248](#4423248) <a name="4423248"></a> <br /> | If you unset an interface static IP address when the interface IP gateway is configured, the <code>nv config apply</code> command fails with an <code>ifreload.service</code> error. To work around this issue, unset both the static IP address and gateway together. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423244"></a> [4423244](#4423244) <a name="4423244"></a> <br /> | When you enable, then disable adaptive routing, the BGP neighbors might go down because of an unresolved MAC address. To resolve this issue configure another attribute on the interface. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423235"></a> [4423235](#4423235) <a name="4423235"></a> <br /> | The <code>snmpd</code> service generates debugging logs of sudo calls. To work around this issue, disable sudo logging for the specific commands run by the Debian-snmp user in the <code>/etc/sudoers.d/snmp</code> file by adding <code>Defaults:Debian-snmp !syslog</code>. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4408387"></a> [4408387](#4408387) <a name="4408387"></a> <br /> | BGP crashes during EVPN route install due to incorrect memory access. | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4398031"></a> [4398031](#4398031) <a name="4398031"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5400 switch, if the PTP slave port is swp66 and is operating at 1Gbps, the  PTP mean path delay value might be reported as a negative value.  | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4360615"></a> [4360615](#4360615) <a name="4360615"></a> <br /> | The control plane trap group counters are not associated correctly with the right trap group. | 5.11.0-5.12.1 | 5.13.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4343690"></a> [4343690](#4343690) <a name="4343690"></a> <br /> | The Swagger UI for the Cumulus OpenAPI model is not rendering correctly (https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux-512/api/index.html#). The interface shows screaming emojis and <code>Could not render</code>.  | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4328729"></a> [4328729](#4328729) <a name="4328729"></a> <br /> | When sending control packets that have the port range 259 through 1023 in their TX base header system target (above <code>cap_max_system_ports</code> and below <code>cap_ports</code> used for LAG forwarding), a fatal health event occurs on the switch. The port range 259 through 1023 reflects illegal system ports; do not set these values in the control packet TX base header. As this range reflects illegal system ports, do not set these values in the control packet TX base header, as it will be dropped. | 5.10.1-5.12.1 | 5.13.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4308857"></a> [4308857](#4308857) <a name="4308857"></a> <br /> | When you use <code>tls_crlcheck</code> in the <code>/etc/nslcd.conf</code> file, the optional <code>nslcd</code> service fails due to a missing library. | 5.9.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4270957"></a> [4270957](#4270957) <a name="4270957"></a> <br /> | Optimized (two partition) upgrade from Cumulus Linux 5.11.0 requires approximately 2.4 Gbytes of free space in <code>/var</code> after downloading the image with NVUE commands instead of 1.6 Gbytes of free space. Upgrade needs the extra space for an additional copy of the downloaded image in <code>/var</code> . | 5.11.0-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4220393"></a> [4220393](#4220393) <a name="4220393"></a> <br /> | The default GRUB timeout style changed from menu to countdown. When booting, a countdown displays on the console and you can use the escape key to break out of the countdown and show the GRUB menu. This reduces the chance of console noise halting the reboot process. If you press the escape key twice, you might go to the GRUB command line. In this case, type <code>normal</code> to get back to the GRUB menu or <code>reboot</code> to reboot the switch. | 5.11.0-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4209429"></a> [4209429](#4209429) <a name="4209429"></a> <br /> | Unreachable or reject routes might not get installed into the SDK. | 5.11.0-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|

| <a name="4183214"></a> [4183214](#4183214) <a name="4183214"></a> <br /> | If you upgrade the switch from Cumulus Linux 5.9.x or 5.10.x with package upgrade and Radius is enabled, you see configuration and commit errors. To avoid this issue,  either disable Radius during package upgrade or disable Radius before package upgrade with the <code>sudo adduser --system --group --home /run/nslcd --no-create-home  --gecos 'nslcd name service LDAP connection daemon' nslcd</code> command. | 5.11.0-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4177067"></a> [4177067](#4177067) <a name="4177067"></a> <br /> | When performing a package upgrade, <code>nslcd</code> installation might open an interactive dialog to configure <code>nslcd.conf </code>.<br>To avoid this interactive dialog, set the <code>DEBIAN_FRONTEND</code> environment variable to <code>noninteractive</code>. For example:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo apt-get update<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" upgrade</pre> | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |

| <a name="4370462"></a> [4370462](#4370462) <a name="4370462"></a> <br /> |  When you assign an IP address to a VRF interface, NVUE removes the 127.0.0.1, 127.0.1.1, and ::1/128 IP addresses from VRF interfaces in the kernel. This results in traffic generated by the switch in the VRF destined to 127.0.0.1 to be sent out of the local device and onto the network. To work around this issue, when assigning an IP address to a VRF interface, also configure the following on the VRF interface to ensure that the expected functionality is maintained:<br><pre>nv set vrf <vrf-id> loopback ip address 127.0.0.1/8<br>nv set vrf <vrf-id> loopback ip address 127.0.1.1/8<br>nv set vrf <vrf-id> loopback ip address ::/128<br>nv config apply -y</pre> | 5.11.0-5.11.1 | |

| <a name="4341608"></a> [4341608](#4341608) <a name="4341608"></a> <br /> | When you enable PFC watchdog, telemetry histograms, and 802.1x with NVUE, then upgrade the switch to Cumulus Linux 5.12 followed by a warm reboot, the switch crashes when a cl-support file is created or by certain <code>sx_api</code> requests. You see error logs in the SDK continuously because the switch collects interface statistics every one second. To work around this issue, reboot the switch. | 5.10.1-5.11.1 | |

Then, <b>after</b> activating <b>rollback</b>, but <b>before</b> rebooting, move <code>/var/lib/nvue/</code> to some other location and copy the previously saved contents to <code>/var/lib/nvue/</code>. | 5.12.0 | |
| <a name="4286413"></a> [4286413](#4286413) <a name="4286413"></a> <br /> | When sending control packets that have the port range 259 through 1023 in their TX base header system target (above <code>cap_max_system_ports</code> and below <code>cap_ports</code> used for LAG forwarding), a fatal health event occurs on the switch. The port range 259 through 1023 reflects illegal system ports; do not set these values in the control packet TX base header.  | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4281099"></a> [4281099](#4281099) <a name="4281099"></a> <br /> | When you bring STP down, then up on the primary MLAG peer, the STP state machine restarts and the peerlink operational edge resets. As a result, the secondary MLAG peer ends up in an STP discarding state. To work around this issue, restart the <code>clagd</code> service. | 5.8.0-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4278870"></a> [4278870](#4278870) <a name="4278870"></a> <br /> | After a factory reset with the <code>nv action reset system factory-default force</code> command, RADIUS does not fully reset; the <code>radius-cmd-acct</code> package is not installed correctly and includes missing files.

| <a name="4268260"></a> [4268260](#4268260) <a name="4268260"></a> <br /> | Due to hardware limitations in the MPS2975, the minimum threshold for PMIC-12-COMEX-VCORE-OUT is fixed and cannot be set to zero. While a threshold violation warning might appear, system functionality remains unaffected, and the current configuration is maintained to ensure device compatibility. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4264726"></a> [4264726](#4264726) <a name="4264726"></a> <br /> | When you configure EVPN multihoming with more than one ESI bond member, you might see intermediate traffic loss. | 5.9.1-5.11.0 | |

| <a name="4260016"></a> [4260016](#4260016) <a name="4260016"></a> <br /> | When you enable SNMP, Cumulus Linux enables and creates an <code>agentx</code> user called <code>debian-snmp</code> automatically for FRR. As a result, TACACS sends log messages similar to the following:<br><pre><<sudo: nss_tacplus: TACACS+ server 10.23.1.0:49 read failed (-3) for user Debian-snmp: Success>><br><<sudo: tac_author_read: reply timeout after 5 secs>></pre><br>To work around this issue, manually add the <code>debian-snmp</code> user to the TACACS configuration <code>exclude_users</code> list so that TACACS ignores this user. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4260014"></a> [4260014](#4260014) <a name="4260014"></a> <br /> | When you configure the SPAN port mirror truncate size to a value greater than four and less than the supported minimum, NVUE allows the configuration even though there are errors and failures in the mirror session configuration.<br>The supported values for truncate size are 32 to 4088 for Spectrum 1, 48 to 4088 for Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3, and 64 to 4088 for Spectrum-4.<br>To work around this issue, run the <code>echo <supported_value> > /cumulus/switchd/config/mirror/session/1/truncate_size</code> command before you reconfigure mirror sessions with the supported values. | 5.8.0-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4260012"></a> [4260012](#4260012) <a name="4260012"></a> <br /> | If all of the neighbors returned in the <code>nv show vrf <vrf> router bgp neighbor</code> command output have no <code>address-family</code> configuration, you see an internal error when the nested table in the  output is being rendered. | 5.10.0-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4259980"></a> [4259980](#4259980) <a name="4259980"></a> <br /> | After you reboot the switch, the ifplugd.service fails to start monitoring the interface. | 5.8.0-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4248634"></a> [4248634](#4248634) <a name="4248634"></a> <br /> | When you add a new MLAG bond, the BPDU guard state of its peer is initialized to False and immediately updated correctly after resync if the bond is up. If the bond is down, resync is not done and the peer PBDU guard state is not updated, which leads to a conflict if the local PBDU guard is enabled.<br>Even though it seems that PBDU configuration does not match between MLAG peers, this issue does not have any functional impact. It gets cleared when the bond becomes up. | 5.9.2-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4248626"></a> [4248626](#4248626) <a name="4248626"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv show system ztp</code> command might report an error when you use a system local that represents time differently from <code>%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z</code>. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4246858"></a> [4246858](#4246858) <a name="4246858"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv show service ntp <vrf></code> command shows the peers that are discovered together with the configured NTP servers instead of displaying only the NTP configuration. As a result, the applied and operational columns have different values, which causes confusion. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4245856"></a> [4245856](#4245856) <a name="4245856"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv show platform transceiver <interface></code> command sometimes does not show transceiver data for layer 3 Dot1q subinterfaces (such as swp2.10). To work around this issue, run the <code>ethtool -m <interface></code> command. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4245853"></a> [4245853](#4245853) <a name="4245853"></a> <br /> | NVUE Rest API calls that are authenticated with TACACS on the switch append unnecessary database entries to the <code>/run/tacacs_clent_map</code> file, which increases the file size. Over time, this increases the TACACS login authentication time, resulting in delayed login authentication.<br> To work around this issue, delete the <code>tacacs_client_map</code> file with the <code>sudo rm rf /run/tacacs_client_map</code> command. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4245850"></a> [4245850](#4245850) <a name="4245850"></a> <br /> | When using the REST API  to move a port from one bridge to another bridge, the <code>bridge-vlan</code> configuration on the port might be programmed incorrectly. To resolve the issue,  run the <code>ifreload -a</code> command. | 5.9.1-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4245819"></a> [4245819](#4245819) <a name="4245819"></a> <br /> | A Python version change removed the encoding argument parameter of the json loads function, which causes an exception. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4223451"></a> [4223451](#4223451) <a name="4223451"></a> <br /> | When you change the VRR MAC address, <code>switchd</code> crashes. This occurs because deleting an old VRR MAC address triggers a neighbor update that changes the ECMP container resolution, which results in route entry updates<br />This happens in async mode, where the end notification expected after an end of operation is missing. | 5.9.2-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4223450"></a> [4223450](#4223450) <a name="4223450"></a> <br /> | Under unique hardware failure conditions, when the ASIC temperature sensor read fails repeatedly, the fans are set to twenty percent, which might not be high enough to maintain proper ASIC cooling, resulting in a thermal shutdown. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4223449"></a> [4223449](#4223449) <a name="4223449"></a> <br /> | On rare occasions, platform drivers capture the firmware state as being in ISSU when it is not the case. This causes the ASIC temperature to be read as 0, which causes the thermal algorithm to set fan speeds to low. As a result, the switch can get overheated and undergo a thermal shutdown. To work around this issue, reboot or powercycle the switch. | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4223448"></a> [4223448](#4223448) <a name="4223448"></a> <br /> | When there is significant traffic generated from the CPU to the network, the health check might report a critical issue.  | 5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4218485"></a> [4218485](#4218485) <a name="4218485"></a> <br /> | When adding or removing routes in a virtual router with numerous configured routes, you might encounter incorrect routing of certain IP addresses. This can result in packets exiting through incorrect ports or being discarded. | 5.5.1-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4200961"></a> [4200961](#4200961) <a name="4200961"></a> <br /> | If you use a bridge name other than <code>br_default</code>, PTP neighbors fail to establish because the PTP packets are sourced from an unexpected IP address.<br>To work around this issue, configure the <code>base-interface</code> for the VLAN interface with the <code>nv set interface <VLAN-id> base-interface <interface-id></code> command. | 5.10.0-5.11.0 | |
| <a name="4200952"></a> [4200952](#4200952) <a name="4200952"></a> <br /> | Configuring the listening-address for the SNMP server fails for IP addresses associated with VRFs other than the management VRF. | 5.11.0 | |
