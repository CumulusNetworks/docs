<td>When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface {{vlan10}}, the route might install against {{vlan10-v0}}. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.
This issue can occur in the following conditions:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, {{clagd}} restart, {{switchd}} restart, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the {{sudo systemctl restart frr.service}} command. </td>
