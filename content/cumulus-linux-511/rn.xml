&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, {{clagd}} restart, {{switchd}} restart, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the {{sudo systemctl restart frr.service}} command. </td>
