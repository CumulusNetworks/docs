{{%notice warning%}}
To align with a long-term vision of a common interface between Cumulus Linux, Nvidia OS (NVOS), and Host-Based Networking, certain NVUE commands in Cumulus Linux 5.12 have changed. Before you upgrade to 5.12, review the list of changed and removed NVUE commands above and be sure to make any necessary changes to your automation.

## Release Considerations

Review the following considerations before you upgrade to Cumulus Linux 5.12.

### Linux Configuration Files Overwritten

{{%notice warning%}}
If you use Linux commands to configure the switch, read the following information before you upgrade to Cumulus Linux 5.12.0 or later.
{{%/notice%}}

Cumulus Linux includes a default NVUE `startup.yaml` file. In addition, NVUE configuration auto save is enabled by default. As a result, Cumulus Linux overwrites any manual changes to Linux configuration files on the switch when the switch reboots after upgrade or you change the `cumulus` user account password with the Linux `passwd` command.

{{%notice note%}}
These issues occur only if you use Linux commands to configure the switch. If you use NVUE commands to configure the switch, these issues do not occur and no action is needed.
{{%/notice%}}

To prevent Cumulus Linux from overwriting manual changes to the Linux configuration files when the switch reboots or when changing the `cumulus` user account password with the `passwd` command, follow the steps below **before** you upgrade to 5.12.0 or later, or after a new binary image installation:

1.  Disable NVUE auto save:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system config auto-save state disabled
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
   cumulus@switch:~$ nv config save
   ```

2. Delete the `/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml` file:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ sudo rm -rf /etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml
   ```

3. Add the `PASSWORD_NVUE_SYNC=no` line to the `/etc/default/nvued` file:
   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/default/nvued
   PASSWORD_NVUE_SYNC=no
   ```

### DHCP Lease with the host-name Option

When a Cumulus Linux switch with NVUE enabled receives a DHCP lease containing the host-name option, it ignores the received hostname and does not apply it. For details, see this [knowledge base article]({{<ref "/knowledge-base/Configuration-and-Usage/Administration/Hostname-Option-Received-From-DHCP-Ignored" >}}).

### NVUE Commands After Upgrade

Cumulus Linux 5.12 includes the NVUE object model. After you upgrade to Cumulus Linux 5.12, running NVUE configuration commands might override configuration for features that are now configurable with NVUE and removes configuration you added manually to files or with automation tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. To keep your configuration, you can do one of the following:
- Update your automation tools to use NVUE.
- {{<link url="NVUE-CLI/#configure-nvue-to-ignore-linux-files" text="Configure NVUE to ignore certain underlying Linux files">}} when applying configuration changes.
- Use Linux and FRR (vtysh) commands instead of NVUE for **all** switch configuration.
