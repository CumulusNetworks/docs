|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="4513850"></a> [4513850](#4513850) <a name="4513850"></a> <br /> | After upgrading from Cumulus Linux 5.12 to 5.13 on the NVIDIA SN5400 switch bonus port, PTP does not converge. To work around this issue, disable, then enable the bonus port after upgrade. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4513849"></a> [4513849](#4513849) <a name="4513849"></a> <br /> | After upgrading from Cumulus Linux 5.12 to 5.13 on the NVIDIA SN5400 switch bonus port, PTP does not converge. To work around this issue, disable, then enable the bonus port after upgrade. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4508830"></a> [4508830](#4508830) <a name="4508830"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux allows you to add bond ports of mismatched speeds (such as 10G and 25G) to the same LACP bond without error and the bond reports UP.  | 5.11.2-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4507163"></a> [4507163](#4507163) <a name="4507163"></a> <br /> | In some cases after a package upgrade with ISSU (warm boot mode), you see continuous errors in the syslog similar to the following:<br><pre>NOTICE  CORE_ASYNC: Error at pre send callback status &#91;Resource is in use&#93;</pre> | 5.11.2-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4499106"></a> [4499106](#4499106) <a name="4499106"></a> <br /> | A newly provisioned dynamic BGP neighbour with an MD5 password in a VRF does not come up until you delete, then re-add the password. | 5.9.2-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4495231"></a> [4495231](#4495231) <a name="4495231"></a> <br /> | If the hardware clock date is later than 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, the image might fail to install due to a grub-install failure on the EFI filesystem, which is a VFAT filesystem.  As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.  You can then use <code>onie-nos-install</code> to install the image. | 5.9.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4486200"></a> [4486200](#4486200) <a name="4486200"></a> <br /> | If you enable dynamic NAT and try to install two identical dynamic NAT rules, <code>switchd</code> might crash. | 5.11.2-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4482933"></a> [4482933](#4482933) <a name="4482933"></a> <br /> | The <code>age</code> and <code>last-update</code> counters in the <code>nv show bridge domain <domain-id> mac-table</code> command output are reversed. The <code>last-update</code> counter shows <code>age</code> data and the <code>age</code> counter shows <code>last-update</code> data. Cumulus Linux uses the <code>age</code> timer to determine when to remove an old MAC entry. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4478125"></a> [4478125](#4478125) <a name="4478125"></a> <br /> | When using optimized image (two partition) upgrade to upgrade the switch to Cumulus Linux 5.13, the <code>/etc/sudoers.d/prometheus</code> file might be missing. To work around this issue, create a file with 0440 permissions and add the following content:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/prometheus<br># commands needed for Prometheus Node Exporter to get LLDP metrics<br>prometheus ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/lldpcli -f json show chassis<br>prometheus ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/lldpcli -f json show neighbor</pre> | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4477903"></a> [4477903](#4477903) <a name="4477903"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux drops SRv6 traffic to the switch due to a missing hardware ECMP entry even though the SRv6 ACL is programmed correctly. To work around this issue, restart the <code>switchd</code> service. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4475111"></a> [4475111](#4475111) <a name="4475111"></a> <br /> | When you try to convert a layer 3 port that is part of ECMP to a bond member,  you might see a failure in the <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue does not have any functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4474924"></a> [4474924](#4474924) <a name="4474924"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv config show -o commands</code> command displays numbered BGP neighbors in IP address range format; however, the <code>nv set</code> commands fail for BGP numbered neighbors configured in IP address ranges. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4471932"></a> [4471932](#4471932) <a name="4471932"></a> <br /> | ERSPAN is not generated with the intended VLAN tag but is always sent out untagged. If the interface is a trunk port or a subinterface, the peer might discard these packets. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4469349"></a> [4469349](#4469349) <a name="4469349"></a> <br /> | When you try to import an invalid server certificate file, Cumulus Linux does not import the certificate file but fails to show an error message. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4466525"></a> [4466525](#4466525) <a name="4466525"></a> <br /> | Radius priority values can range between 1 and 8. Configuring an invalid priority succeeds when it should fail. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4461102"></a> [4461102](#4461102) <a name="4461102"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, when a port is down and you apply adaptive routing with the link-utilization-threshold setting to the port as it goes up, you might see in log errors while the port is not yet up. | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4460588"></a> [4460588](#4460588) <a name="4460588"></a> <br /> | The NVIDIA SN5610 switch might experience FEC burstinesswith multiple optics, which can impact link stability and performance. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4458898"></a> [4458898](#4458898) <a name="4458898"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv config patch</code> and <code>nv config replace</code> commands have no effect with filenames with relative paths, such as <code>./config.yaml</code>, <code>../config.yaml},  and so on. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4458873"></a> [4458873](#4458873) <a name="4458873"></a> <br /> | The SN5610 switch records a High FEC Bin Error at room temperature. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2|
| <a name="4457165"></a> [4457165](#4457165) <a name="4457165"></a> <br /> | When a spine switch reboots and comes back online, leaf switches might cause prolonged convergence times due to premature traffic forwarding. The leaf switch immediately begins ECMP load-balancing traffic to the recovered spine before the spine has fully programmed its routing tables, resulting in traffic blackholing during the spine's route convergence process. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4449947"></a> [4449947](#4449947) <a name="4449947"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv config patch</code> and <code>nv config replace</code> commands have no effect with filenames with relative paths, such as <code>./config.yaml</code>, <code>../config.yaml},  and so on. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2|
| <a name="4447797"></a> [4447797](#4447797) <a name="4447797"></a> <br /> | When you remove an FRU, such as a PSU, from the switch, stale statistical data from the component is still reported over GNMI and OTLP.  <br>To resolve this issue in OTLP, the status metric is now updated to <code>absent</code> and statistical information is no longer streamed. In GNMI, the entire component is deleted from the <code>/components</code> tree. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4447794"></a> [4447794](#4447794) <a name="4447794"></a> <br /> | The gNMI value for the sensor alarm-status shows incorrectly. For a raised alarm, the alarm-status is <code>True(1)</code>  but normally functioning sensors also show <code>True(1)</code>. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4447661"></a> [4447661](#4447661) <a name="4447661"></a> <br /> | During link down events affecting a subset of local links, <code>switchd</code> might observe extra route deletions due to timing mismatches between Zebra and kernel processing of Next Hop Group (NHG) changes. Routes should transition directly from one NHG to another, but instead get temporarily deleted and reinstalled, causing unnecessary churn. Zebra logs might show <code>Extended Error: Nexthop id does not exist</code> messages during partial link down scenarios<br /> | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4443870"></a> [4443870](#4443870) <a name="4443870"></a> <br /> | When running tens of thousands of <code>nv set</code> commands, the <code>/var/lib/nvue</code> directory might grow to several GBs in size, potentially using all the disk space. To work around this issue, run the following commands to reduce the disk space in the <code>/var/lib/nvue</code> directory:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo su<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ cd /var/lib/nvue/config<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ git gc</pre> | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2|
| <a name="4440766"></a> [4440766](#4440766) <a name="4440766"></a> <br /> | When you try to delete a trusted ca key, Cumulus Linux shows an incorrect error message. To remove a trusted ca key, you must unset the key ID, not the key literal. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4438933"></a> [4438933](#4438933) <a name="4438933"></a> <br /> | When gNMI subscription and configuration changes to an interface occur simultaneously, the interface statistics process can crash and leave a core file.  | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4438061"></a> [4438061](#4438061) <a name="4438061"></a> <br /> | Trusted CA key names and literals do not have a size limit, which can result in buffer overflow risks. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4427224"></a> [4427224](#4427224) <a name="4427224"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv show interface</code> command output shows the operational status as down for a link flap error disabled state instead of the real protodown reason. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv show interface status</code> command, which shows if any of the interfaces are protodown with the protodown reason. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4425288"></a> [4425288](#4425288) <a name="4425288"></a> <br /> | When gNMI streaming is enabled on the switch, Cumulus Linux generates a cl-support file the first time you perform an FRR operation that reloads or restarts the FRR service (such as remove or add a neighbor or add or modify static routes). | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4423249"></a> [4423249](#4423249) <a name="4423249"></a> <br /> | If you unset an interface static IP address when the interface IP gateway is configured, the <code>nv config apply</code> command fails with an <code>ifreload.service</code> error. To work around the issue, unset both the static IP address and gateway together. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2|
| <a name="4423248"></a> [4423248](#4423248) <a name="4423248"></a> <br /> | If you unset an interface static IP address when the interface IP gateway is configured, the <code>nv config apply</code> command fails with an <code>ifreload.service</code> error. To work around the issue, unset both the static IP address and gateway together. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4423245"></a> [4423245](#4423245) <a name="4423245"></a> <br /> | When you enable, then disable adaptive routing, BGP neighbors might go down because of an unresolved MAC address. To resolve this issue configure another attribute on the interface. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2|
| <a name="4423244"></a> [4423244](#4423244) <a name="4423244"></a> <br /> | When you enable, then disable adaptive routing, the BGP neighbors might go down because of an unresolved MAC address. To resolve this issue configure another attribute on the interface. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4423223"></a> [4423223](#4423223) <a name="4423223"></a> <br /> | When processing the static IP assignment for an interface previously managed through DHCP, Cumulus Linux fails to clean up the DHCP created state completely. As a result when the IP address assigned by DHCP earlier expires, the switch eventually loses connectivity. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4423175"></a> [4423175](#4423175) <a name="4423175"></a> <br /> | When you configure an API port with a TCP port already in use, the <code>nginx</code> server fails to restart. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4414935"></a> [4414935](#4414935) <a name="4414935"></a> <br /> | Interface counters retrieved from the kernel are not reset when <code>switchd</code> restarts. These kernel counters are inconsistent with other telemetry counters that do reset when <code>switchd</code> restarts. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4413589"></a> [4413589](#4413589) <a name="4413589"></a> <br /> | A MAC-only EVPN type-2 route is wrongly advertised with the layer 3 VNI label in the BGP NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information). Although this does not have any functional impact, it is not the desired RFC behavior. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4413450"></a> [4413450](#4413450) <a name="4413450"></a> <br /> | When displaying BGP neighbor advertised routes in JSON format with very large routing tables, the process consumes excessive memory resulting in out of memory crashes.  | 5.0.0-5.11.1, 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2|
| <a name="4408549"></a> [4408549](#4408549) <a name="4408549"></a> <br /> | UMF processes do not include log rotation and the logs can grow very large causing operational failures when you generate cl-support files and run the <code>nv config apply</code> command. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4408387"></a> [4408387](#4408387) <a name="4408387"></a> <br /> | BGP crashes during EVPN route install due to incorrect memory access. | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4402017"></a> [4402017](#4402017) <a name="4402017"></a> <br /> | The <code>auth.log</code> file contains sensitive information for hashed passwords. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2|
| <a name="4398031"></a> [4398031](#4398031) <a name="4398031"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5400 switch, if the PTP slave port is swp66 and is operating at 1Gbps, the  PTP mean path delay value might be reported as a negative value.  | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4393369"></a> [4393369](#4393369) <a name="4393369"></a> <br /> | If you generate a cl-support file after configuring a breakout port, the syslog file includes errors due to a statistic collection failure for stale ports. This issue has no functional impact. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4386779"></a> [4386779](#4386779) <a name="4386779"></a> <br /> | When you start gNMI subscription from a remote client, interface rates reset and values start from 0.  | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4360826"></a> [4360826](#4360826) <a name="4360826"></a> <br /> | On rare occasions, when you run the NVUE <code>nv config apply</code> command, <code>switchd</code> crashes, then restarts after the crash and resumes its normal flow of operation. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4343690"></a> [4343690](#4343690) <a name="4343690"></a> <br /> | The Swagger UI for the Cumulus OpenAPI model is not rendering correctly (https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux-512/api/index.html#). The interface shows "screaming" emojis and "Could not render."  | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4341806"></a> [4341806](#4341806) <a name="4341806"></a> <br /> | The BGP uptime differs between vtysh and NVUE command output. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4337278"></a> [4337278](#4337278) <a name="4337278"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, statically configured VXLAN entries age out after a peerlink flap. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4329931"></a> [4329931](#4329931) <a name="4329931"></a> <br /> | In previous releases, Cumulus Linux incorrectly allowed SyncE and PPS In features to be enabled at the same time. Upgrading systems with both features configured using NVUE to 5.12.0 or higher results in a failure to apply the startup configuration as part of the first boot of the upgraded version. To work around the issue, unset one of the features before you upgrade. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4309876"></a> [4309876](#4309876) <a name="4309876"></a> <br /> | When you configure an invalid switch port (swp), NVUE adds the invalid configuration instead of rejecting it. The invalid interface in the configuration does not have any functional impact. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4308857"></a> [4308857](#4308857) <a name="4308857"></a> <br /> | When you use <code>tls_crlcheck</code> in the <code>/etc/nslcd.conf</code> file, the optional <code>nslcd</code> service fails due to a missing library. | 5.9.2-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4294156"></a> [4294156](#4294156) <a name="4294156"></a> <br /> | After you clear the RoCE counters with the <code>nv action clear interface <interface-id> qos roce counters</code> command, the <code>buffer-max-usage</code> counters in the <code>nv show interface <interface-id> qos roce counters</code> command output do not show updated (cleared) values. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4280299"></a> [4280299](#4280299) <a name="4280299"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv action fetch system packages key <key-id></code> command fails if the key ID is an SCP, FTP, or URL path that requires a password to access the key. To work around this issue, use a URI that does not require password authentication for the key ID. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4277042"></a> [4277042](#4277042) <a name="4277042"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5600 switch, you see low power alarms immediately after a reboot. The alarms disappear after showing up initially. Certain modules typically show low power alarms on initialization. No action is needed. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4249096"></a> [4249096](#4249096) <a name="4249096"></a> <br /> | Binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.3.1 to 5.12.0 and later is not supported. To work around this issue, perform a binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.3.1 to 5.9.0, then perform a binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 5.9.0 to 5.12.0. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4236419"></a> [4236419](#4236419) <a name="4236419"></a> <br /> | On the Spectrum-3 switch, the PTP offset for 25GbE fluctuates within a range of plus or minus 50 nanoseconds beyond the expected values. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4214678"></a> [4214678](#4214678) <a name="4214678"></a> <br /> | Changes to open telemetry configuration or export states restarts the telemetry service and resets all health metrics. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4177067"></a> [4177067](#4177067) <a name="4177067"></a> <br /> | When doing a package upgrade from CL5.9 or CL5.10 to CL5.11 or later, the installation of <code>nslcd</code> might open an interactive dialog to configure <code>nslcd.conf </code>.<br>To avoid this interactive dialog, set the <code>DEBIAN_FRONTEND</code> environment variable to <code>noninteractive</code>. For example:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo apt-get update<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" upgrade</pre> | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4154839"></a> [4154839](#4154839) <a name="4154839"></a> <br /> | When you run certain SDK commands (such as <code>sudo sx_api_port_counter_dump_all.py</code> or <code>sx_api_fdb_dump</code>) first as the cumulus user, then with <code>sudo</code>, you see the following error:<br><pre>PermissionError: Errno 13&#93; Permission denied: '/tmp/python_err_log.txt'</pre><br>To resolve this issue, run the <code>rm -rf /tmp/python_err_log.txt</code> command. | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4142857"></a> [4142857](#4142857) <a name="4142857"></a> <br /> | The switch drops PTP packets received with extra ethernet padding and you see syslog <code>&#91;ptp4l.ERR&#93; messages. | 5.10.0-5.13.1 | |
| <a name="4139511"></a> [4139511](#4139511) <a name="4139511"></a> <br /> | When you generate the cl-support file on the Spectrum-4 switch, the following messages appear on the serial console. You can safely ignore this issue.<br><pre>&#91; 1903.595131&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br>&#91; 1903.601089&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=query)<br>&#91; 1903.609961&#93; hwmon hwmon28: Failed to query module temperature thresholds<br>&#91; 1903.846724&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br>&#91; 1903.852689&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=query)<br>&#91; 1903.861573&#93; hwmon hwmon28: Failed to query module temperature</pre> | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | |

| <a name="4411453"></a> [4411453](#4411453) <a name="4411453"></a> <br /> | Zebra might crash when multiple interfaces flap rapidly with a large scale number of routes. This issue occurs because the next hop group hash comparison incorrectly treats distinct next hop groups as equal. I addition, the hashing logic currently uses only four bytes of the IPv6 address, which increases the likelihood of collisions and misidentification.  Avoid rapidly flapping multiple interfaces when managing large scale routes. |  | |
