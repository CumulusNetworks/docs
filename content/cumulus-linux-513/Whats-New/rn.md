## 5.13.1 Release Notes
### Open Issues in 5.13.1

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="4608614"></a> [4608614](#4608614) <a name="4608614"></a> <br /> | When setting up SSH keys, you have to run <code>nv config apply</code> twice for the configuration to take effect. | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4605303"></a> [4605303](#4605303) <a name="4605303"></a> <br /> | The downstream VNI software VXLAN encapsulation path does not derive the source IP address of the outer IP header properly. Instead of using the defined <code>vxlan-local-tunnelip</code> under the loopback interface, it uses the underlay interface on which the packet egresses the VTEP. In a mixed vendor environment, this might lead to a drop on the decapsulating VTEP if it is not an Nvidia Cumulus Linux switch. To work around this issue, use symmetric VNI configuration instead of downstream VNI or use downstream VNI with an unnumbered underlay. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4601056"></a> [4601056](#4601056) <a name="4601056"></a> <br /> | The neighbor manager service memory usage increases significantly after the number of entries in the kernel neighbor table exceeds the <code>gc_threshold</code>. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4597153"></a> [4597153](#4597153) <a name="4597153"></a> <br /> | When you use a gateway-interface configuration with the source IP address as the gateway interface, DHCP Relay is unable to send packets to the DHCP server after flapping the gateway interface. To work around this issue, restart the DHCP Relay service or avoid configuring the gateway interface to be same as the uplink or downlink interface on the DHCP Relay node. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4582679"></a> [4582679](#4582679) <a name="4582679"></a> <br /> | If a node has Suppress Route Advertisement enabled and routes are re-learned; for example, when a peer sends the route again due to route policy changes, or you enable or disable graceful shutdown, not all routes are offloaded, which might cause discrepancies in traffic.  | 5.9.4-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4579237"></a> [4579237](#4579237) <a name="4579237"></a> <br /> | If interface statistics telemetry is running on the switch, an <code>interface_stats_collector</code> core file might generate during statistics collection. | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4570105"></a> [4570105](#4570105) <a name="4570105"></a> <br /> | During initial configuration of an MLAG switch with no MLAG peer or if both MLAG peers go down and only one recovers, VXLAN traffic arriving on the MLAG switch with a local IP destination might see packet loss.  | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4566678"></a> [4566678](#4566678) <a name="4566678"></a> <br /> | If you enable LACP bypass mode on a bond, the switch removes the member ports from the interface and the <code>nv show interface <interface-id> qos roce status</code> command shows <code>Error: The requested item does not exist</code>. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv show interface <interface-id> qos roce status</code> command on the member physical port.  | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4562806"></a> [4562806](#4562806) <a name="4562806"></a> <br /> | When there is a very high volume of MLD traffic in a VXLAN environment, the switch CPU and control protocols might be impacted. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4556982"></a> [4556982](#4556982) <a name="4556982"></a> <br /> | In a Spanning Tree PVRST configuration, when one bridge interface goes down, all the other bridge interfaces enter a blocking state for approximately ten seconds. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4555938"></a> [4555938](#4555938) <a name="4555938"></a> <br /> | When one of the FRR processes such as <code>bgpd</code> or zebra goes down, <code>watchfrr</code> tries to restart those processes and also restarts the routing telemetry service, which blocks <code>watchfrr</code> causing cascading failures on other processes. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4548512"></a> [4548512](#4548512) <a name="4548512"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, etc.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4546389"></a> [4546389](#4546389) <a name="4546389"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv config show -o commands</code> command displays numbered BGP neighbors in IP address range format; however, the <code>nv set</code> commands fail for BGP numbered neighbors configured in IP address ranges. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4544433"></a> [4544433](#4544433) <a name="4544433"></a> <br /> | When you enable bandwidth gauge on an interface, the <code>asic-monitor</code> leaks memory steadily over time. The memory leak rate depends on how many interfaces have the bandwidth gauge enabled and the snapshot rate.  | 5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4540985"></a> [4540985](#4540985) <a name="4540985"></a> <br /> | If you have a transceiver module with a vendor name containing invalid characters and OTEL is enabled, the switch generates an <code>interface_stats</code> core file.  | 5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4539084"></a> [4539084](#4539084) <a name="4539084"></a> <br /> | When you lower the speed for an interface,  the <code>nv show interface rates</code> command output might show the link utilization percentage above 100 percent.  This issue is corrected automatically after the load interval duration. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4535856"></a> [4535856](#4535856) <a name="4535856"></a> <br /> | When you try to import an invalid server certificate file, Cumulus Linux does not import the certificate file but fails to show an error message. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535804"></a> [4535804](#4535804) <a name="4535804"></a> <br /> | If you use a bridge name other than <code>br_default</code>, PTP neighbors fail to establish because the PTP packets are sourced from an unexpected IP address.<br>To work around this issue, configure the <code>base-interface</code> for the VLAN interface with the <code>nv set interface <VLAN-id> base-interface <interface-id></code> command. | 5.10.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535749"></a> [4535749](#4535749) <a name="4535749"></a> <br /> | The <code>uc-discards</code> field in the <code>nv show interface <interface> counters qos egress-queue-stats</code> command output is actually the number of packets discarded per queue, but it is wrongly interpreted as bytes. To work around this issue, convert the data shown in bytes to packets by multiplying by 1024 if the data is in KB, 1024x1024 if the data is in MB, and 1024x1024x1024 if the data is in GB. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535699"></a> [4535699](#4535699) <a name="4535699"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535696"></a> [4535696](#4535696) <a name="4535696"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.12.1-5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4531952"></a> [4531952](#4531952) <a name="4531952"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, etc.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.11.1-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4531104"></a> [4531104](#4531104) <a name="4531104"></a> <br /> | On a switch with SDK 4.6.1062 or earlier, you might see FW fatal health events. | 5.6.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4526096"></a> [4526096](#4526096) <a name="4526096"></a> <br /> | The global VRRP priority level change is not applied to the VRRP interface. It is always set to 100. | 5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4524763"></a> [4524763](#4524763) <a name="4524763"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux does not provide a specific error message if you try to configure an ACL rule with conflicting match protocol criteria. For example, if you configure a single rule with both <code>match ip protocol tcp</code> and <code>match ip udp dest-port <port></code>, you see the following error:<br><pre>Unable to run ‘install_acls.sh’ script:<br><br />RAN: sudo -S bash /var/lib/nvue/config/install_acls.sh</pre><br>To work around this issue, configure consistent protocol match statements in each ACL rule. | 5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4521203"></a> [4521203](#4521203) <a name="4521203"></a> <br /> | The SATA driver on the NVIDIA SN2410 switch sometimes exhibits failures similar to the following:<br><pre>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785966+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: <br>&#91;49878794.456350&#93; ata1.00: failed command: WRITE FPDMA QUEUED<br>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785968+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: &#91;49878794.461984&#93; ata1.00: cmd<br>61/08:08:50:2b:c4/00:00:01:00:00/40 tag 1 ncq dma 4096 out<br>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785970+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: &#91;49878794.461984&#93; res 40/00:0c:50:2b:c4/00:00:01:00:00/40 Emask 0×10 (ATA bus error)</pre><br>To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. | 5.5.1-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4517549"></a> [4517549](#4517549) <a name="4517549"></a> <br /> | If you use TACACS on the default VRF while using multiple switch ports (ECMP) to reach the TACACS server,  Cumulus Linux only allows you to configure a single port, even though there are multiple ports to reach the server. When configuring the single port, you see issues such as long delays to login, authentication failures,  sudo command failures after login, username changes to an unknown <code>tacacsNN</code> user on the shell prompt. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4516848"></a> [4516848](#4516848) <a name="4516848"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv show system health</code> command output might show <code>status-led amber</code> and <code>rasdaemon inactive</code> due to a failed <code>rasdaemon</code> start even though the actual system status LED is green. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4513849"></a> [4513849](#4513849) <a name="4513849"></a> <br /> | After upgrading from Cumulus Linux 5.12 on the NVIDIA SN5400 switch bonus port, PTP does not converge. To work around this issue, disable, then enable the bonus port after upgrade. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4509255"></a> [4509255](#4509255) <a name="4509255"></a> <br /> | In PTP two-step, the hardware incorrectly modifies the SYNC message correction field. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4509053"></a> [4509053](#4509053) <a name="4509053"></a> <br /> | When the default route is available through a floating static route (admin distance 254) and through an eBGP learned route where the next hop is the eBGP peer, the route that comes up first (the floating static) becomes the best path, even though the BGP learned route is presented as the best path after the neighbor comes up. To work around this issue, set the <code>nv set vrf <vrf-id> router bgp peer-group <peer-group-id> nexthop-connected-check off</code> command in NVUE or configure <code>neighbor <peer> disable-connected-check</code> in vtysh. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4508830"></a> [4508830](#4508830) <a name="4508830"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux allows you to add bond ports of mismatched speeds (such as 10G and 25G) to the same LACP bond without error and the bond reports UP.  | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4507163"></a> [4507163](#4507163) <a name="4507163"></a> <br /> | In some cases after a package upgrade with ISSU (warm boot mode), you see continuous errors in the syslog similar to the following:<br><pre>NOTICE  CORE_ASYNC: Error at pre send callback status &#91;Resource is in use&#93;</pre> | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4502199"></a> [4502199](#4502199) <a name="4502199"></a> <br /> | The TFTP client drops packets due to default firewall rules. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.9.4, 5.14.0|
| <a name="4500170"></a> [4500170](#4500170) <a name="4500170"></a> <br /> | When you use the API to compare a revision between a revision ID and an applied revision, the output adds the encrypted values in the diffs incorrectly, indicating that there are diffs when there are no diffs. The NVUE <code>nv config diff</code> command shows the correct output. | 5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4499025"></a> [4499025](#4499025) <a name="4499025"></a> <br /> | You see a high volume of NAT and NFCT errors flooding <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue has no functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4495383"></a> [4495383](#4495383) <a name="4495383"></a> <br /> | NVUE configuration yaml file translation converts unset commands to set commands because the translation logic expects only set commands.  | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4495231"></a> [4495231](#4495231) <a name="4495231"></a> <br /> | If the hardware clock date is later than 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, the image might fail to install due to a grub-install failure on the EFI filesystem, which is a VFAT filesystem.  As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.  You can then use <code>onie-nos-install</code> to install the image. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4493540"></a> [4493540](#4493540) <a name="4493540"></a> <br /> | The CBS field in the <code>nv show system control-plane policer</code> command output might not show the configured value. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.9.4, 5.14.0|
| <a name="4486200"></a> [4486200](#4486200) <a name="4486200"></a> <br /> | If you enable dynamic NAT and try to install two identical dynamic NAT rules, <code>switchd</code> might crash. | 5.11.2-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4482933"></a> [4482933](#4482933) <a name="4482933"></a> <br /> | The <code>age</code> and <code>last-update</code> counters in the <code>nv show bridge domain <domain-id> mac-table</code> command output are reversed. The <code>last-update</code> counter shows <code>age</code> data and the <code>age</code> counter shows <code>last-update</code> data. Cumulus Linux uses the <code>age</code> timer to determine when to remove an old MAC entry. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.9.4, 5.14.0|
| <a name="4482790"></a> [4482790](#4482790) <a name="4482790"></a> <br /> | There is an inconsistency in the structure of certain gNMI streaming interface metrics. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4478125"></a> [4478125](#4478125) <a name="4478125"></a> <br /> | When using optimized image (two partition) upgrade to upgrade the switch to Cumulus Linux 5.13, the <code>/etc/sudoers.d/prometheus</code> file might be missing. To work around this issue, create a file with 0440 permissions and add the following content:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/prometheus<br># commands needed for Prometheus Node Exporter to get LLDP metrics<br>prometheus ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/lldpcli -f json show chassis<br>prometheus ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/lldpcli -f json show neighbor</pre> | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4477903"></a> [4477903](#4477903) <a name="4477903"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux drops SRv6 traffic to the switch due to a missing hardware ECMP entry even though the SRv6 ACL is programmed correctly. To work around this issue, restart the <code>switchd</code> service. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4475111"></a> [4475111](#4475111) <a name="4475111"></a> <br /> | When you try to convert a layer 3 port that is part of ECMP to a bond member,  you might see a failure in the <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue does not have any functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4475104"></a> [4475104](#4475104) <a name="4475104"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5610 switch, bringing up around 256 links takes a long time (approximately 90 seconds). | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4475095"></a> [4475095](#4475095) <a name="4475095"></a> <br /> | The BGP service might crash when you have overlapping routes between two VRFs and you are leaking these routes between these VRFs in an EVPN environment. Avoid leaking overlapping IP addresses or subnets between two VRFs. This is typically accomplished by filtering the overlapping IP address or subnet routes with a prefix list and route map. | 5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4474924"></a> [4474924](#4474924) <a name="4474924"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv config show -o commands</code> command displays numbered BGP neighbors in IP address range format; however, the <code>nv set</code> commands fail for BGP numbered neighbors configured in IP address ranges. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4472414"></a> [4472414](#4472414) <a name="4472414"></a> <br /> | After you modify the IP address of an SVI, DHCP relay uses an old cached IP address instead of the changed IP address. This occurs because DHCP relay monitors the link state change not IP address change. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4471932"></a> [4471932](#4471932) <a name="4471932"></a> <br /> | ERSPAN is not generated with the intended VLAN tag but is always sent out untagged. If the interface is a trunk port or a subinterface, the peer might discard these packets. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4469479"></a> [4469479](#4469479) <a name="4469479"></a> <br /> | If you use NVUE to unset an extremely large IP prefix list (around 50K), the command might time out when unconfiguring FRR. As a result, you see the message <code>Failure during apply. Ignore? &#91;y/N&#93;</code> and the FRR service stops.  | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4469349"></a> [4469349](#4469349) <a name="4469349"></a> <br /> | When you try to import an invalid server certificate file, Cumulus Linux does not import the certificate file but fails to show an error message. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4467245"></a> [4467245](#4467245) <a name="4467245"></a> <br /> | Transceiver channel power values in dBm reported through streaming telemetry protocols such as OTLP and GNMI are imprecise and are rounded to whole numbers. The NVUE <code>nv show platform transceiver <port></code> command or  Linux <code>ethtool -m <port></code> command provides more precise, floating-point values. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4466525"></a> [4466525](#4466525) <a name="4466525"></a> <br /> | Radius priority values can range between 1 and 8; however Cumulus Linux allows you to configure an invalid priority. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4461102"></a> [4461102](#4461102) <a name="4461102"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, when a port is down and you apply adaptive routing with the link utilization threshold setting to the port as it goes up, you might see log errors while the port is not yet up. | 5.11.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4460588"></a> [4460588](#4460588) <a name="4460588"></a> <br /> | The NVIDIA SN5610 switch might experience FEC burstiness with multiple optics, which can impact link stability and performance. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4458873"></a> [4458873](#4458873) <a name="4458873"></a> <br /> | The SN5610 switch records a High FEC Bin Error at room temperature. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.11.2, 5.14.0|

| <a name="4608614"></a> [4608614](#4608614) <a name="4608614"></a> <br /> | When setting up SSH keys, you have to run <code>nv config apply</code> twice for the configuration to take effect. | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4605303"></a> [4605303](#4605303) <a name="4605303"></a> <br /> | The downstream VNI software VXLAN encapsulation path does not derive the source IP address of the outer IP header properly. Instead of using the defined <code>vxlan-local-tunnelip</code> under the loopback interface, it uses the underlay interface on which the packet egresses the VTEP. In a mixed vendor environment, this might lead to a drop on the decapsulating VTEP if it is not an Nvidia Cumulus Linux switch. To work around this issue, use symmetric VNI configuration instead of downstream VNI or use downstream VNI with an unnumbered underlay. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4582679"></a> [4582679](#4582679) <a name="4582679"></a> <br /> | If a node has Suppress Route Advertisement enabled and routes are re-learned; for example, when a peer sends the route again due to route policy changes, or you enable or disable graceful shutdown, not all routes are offloaded, which might cause discrepancies in traffic.  | 5.9.4-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4579237"></a> [4579237](#4579237) <a name="4579237"></a> <br /> | If interface statistics telemetry is running on the switch, an <code>interface_stats_collector</code> core file might generate during statistics collection. | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4562806"></a> [4562806](#4562806) <a name="4562806"></a> <br /> | When there is a very high volume of MLD traffic in a VXLAN environment, the switch CPU and control protocols might be impacted. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4555938"></a> [4555938](#4555938) <a name="4555938"></a> <br /> | When one of the FRR processes such as <code>bgpd</code> or zebra goes down, <code>watchfrr</code> tries to restart those processes and also restarts the routing telemetry service, which blocks <code>watchfrr</code> causing cascading failures on other processes. | 5.12.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4548512"></a> [4548512](#4548512) <a name="4548512"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, etc.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |

| <a name="4539084"></a> [4539084](#4539084) <a name="4539084"></a> <br /> | When you lower the speed for an interface,  the <code>nv show interface rates</code> command output might show the link utilization percentage above 100 percent.

| <a name="4535804"></a> [4535804](#4535804) <a name="4535804"></a> <br /> | If you use a bridge name other than <code>br_default</code>, PTP neighbors fail to establish because the PTP packets are sourced from an unexpected IP address.<br>To work around this issue, configure the <code>base-interface</code> for the VLAN interface with the <code>nv set interface <VLAN-id> base-interface <interface-id></code> command. | 5.10.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535749"></a> [4535749](#4535749) <a name="4535749"></a> <br /> | The <code>uc-discards</code> field in the <code>nv show interface <interface> counters qos egress-queue-stats</code> command output is actually the number of packets discarded per queue, but it is wrongly interpreted as bytes. To work around this issue, convert the data shown in bytes to packets by multiplying by 1024 if the data is in KB, 1024x1024 if the data is in MB, and 1024x1024x1024 if the data is in GB. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |

| <a name="4517549"></a> [4517549](#4517549) <a name="4517549"></a> <br /> | If you use TACACS on the default VRF while using multiple switch ports (ECMP) to reach the TACACS server,  Cumulus Linux only allows you to configure a single port, even though there are multiple ports to reach the server. When configuring the single port, you see issues such as long delays to login, authentication failures,  sudo command failures after login, username changes to an unknown <code>tacacsNN</code> user on the shell prompt. | 5.13.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|

As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.

This issue occurs because the next hop group hash comparison incorrectly treats distinct next hop groups as equal. I addition, the hashing logic currently uses only four bytes of the IPv6 address, which increases the likelihood of collisions and misidentification.  Avoid rapidly flapping multiple interfaces when managing large scale routes. |  | |
