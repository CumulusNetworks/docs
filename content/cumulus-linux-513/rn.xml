<td>Zebra might crash when multiple interfaces flap rapidly with a large scale number of routes. This issue occurs because the next hop group hash comparison incorrectly treats distinct next hop groups as equal. I addition, the hashing logic currently uses only four bytes of the IPv6 address, which increases the likelihood of collisions and misidentification.  Avoid rapidly flapping multiple interfaces when managing large scale routes.</td>
