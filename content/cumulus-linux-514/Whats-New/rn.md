## 5.14.0 Release Notes
### Open Issues in 5.14.0

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="4608614"></a> [4608614](#4608614) <a name="4608614"></a> <br /> | When setting up SSH keys, you have to run <code>nv config apply</code> twice for the configuration to take effect. | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4607838"></a> [4607838](#4607838) <a name="4607838"></a> <br /> | You might see convergence degradation in remote link failure scenarios due to very chatty LTTng traces.    | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4605303"></a> [4605303](#4605303) <a name="4605303"></a> <br /> | The downstream VNI software VXLAN encapsulation path does not derive the source IP address of the outer IP header properly. Instead of using the defined <code>vxlan-local-tunnelip</code> under the loopback interface, it uses the underlay interface on which the packet egresses the VTEP. In a mixed vendor environment, this might lead to a drop on the decapsulating VTEP if it is not an Nvidia Cumulus Linux switch. To work around this issue, use symmetric VNI configuration instead of downstream VNI or use downstream VNI with an unnumbered underlay. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4601056"></a> [4601056](#4601056) <a name="4601056"></a> <br /> | The neighbor manager service memory usage increases significantly after the number of entries in the kernel neighbor table exceeds the <code>gc_threshold</code>. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4597330"></a> [4597330](#4597330) <a name="4597330"></a> <br /> | The switch sends out IPv6 neighbor discovery (ND) router advertisement through an interface that does not have router advertisement enabled. To prevent this issue, do not change or remove the remote-as of a peer-group that is used by BGP unnumbered peers.  To work around this issue, restart FRR. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4597153"></a> [4597153](#4597153) <a name="4597153"></a> <br /> | When you use a gateway-interface configuration with the source IP address as the gateway interface, DHCP Relay is unable to send packets to the DHCP server after flapping the gateway interface. To work around this issue, restart the DHCP Relay service or avoid configuring the gateway interface to be same as the uplink or downlink interface on the DHCP Relay node. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4582679"></a> [4582679](#4582679) <a name="4582679"></a> <br /> | If a node has Suppress Route Advertisement enabled and routes are re-learned; for example, when a peer sends the route again due to route policy changes, or you enable or disable graceful shutdown, not all routes are offloaded, which might cause discrepancies in traffic.  | 5.9.4-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4582566"></a> [4582566](#4582566) <a name="4582566"></a> <br /> | The <code>cnp_pg_map</code> and <code>roce_pg_map</code> fields are missing in the NVUE <code>nv show interface <interface> qos roce status</code> and <code>nv show interface qos-roce-status</code> commands. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4579237"></a> [4579237](#4579237) <a name="4579237"></a> <br /> | If interface statistics telemetry is running on the switch, an <code>interface_stats_collector</code> core file might generate during statistics collection. | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4570105"></a> [4570105](#4570105) <a name="4570105"></a> <br /> | During initial configuration of an MLAG switch with no MLAG peer or if both MLAG peers go down and only one recovers, VXLAN traffic arriving on the MLAG switch with a local IP destination might see packet loss.  | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4566678"></a> [4566678](#4566678) <a name="4566678"></a> <br /> | If you enable LACP bypass mode on a bond, the switch removes the member ports from the interface and the <code>nv show interface <interface-id> qos roce status</code> command shows <code>Error: The requested item does not exist</code>. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv show interface <interface-id> qos roce status</code> command on the member physical port.  | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4562806"></a> [4562806](#4562806) <a name="4562806"></a> <br /> | When there is a very high volume of MLD traffic in a VXLAN environment, the switch CPU and control protocols might be impacted. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4557007"></a> [4557007](#4557007) <a name="4557007"></a> <br /> | Incorrect prefix boundaries are set for traffic class, switch priority, and port groups for the <code>qos/interfaces/interface&#91;interface-id&#93;</code> metrics, which sends redundant data. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4556982"></a> [4556982](#4556982) <a name="4556982"></a> <br /> | In a Spanning Tree PVRST configuration, when one bridge interface goes down, all the other bridge interfaces enter a blocking state for approximately ten seconds. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4554858"></a> [4554858](#4554858) <a name="4554858"></a> <br /> | The default poll interval for on-change notifications is set to 10 seconds instead of 1 second for gNMI packet trimming metrics. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4551249"></a> [4551249](#4551249) <a name="4551249"></a> <br /> | The NVUE service might fail during switch upgrade. To work around this issue, stop the <code>sysmonitor</code> with the <code>sudo systemctl stop sysmonitor</code> command, then upgrade the switch with the <code>nv action upgrade system packages to latest</code> command. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4549896"></a> [4549896](#4549896) <a name="4549896"></a> <br /> | When you try to set a VXLAN with a bridge, you see the error <code>sx_sdk: 22985 &#91;BRIDGE&#93; &#91;ERROR  &#93;: Port(0x200A000D)) already added to a bridge</code>. You can safely ignore this error as it doesn't impact switch functionality.  | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4548514"></a> [4548514](#4548514) <a name="4548514"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, and so on.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.9.1-5.9.3, 5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4548512"></a> [4548512](#4548512) <a name="4548512"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, etc.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4547463"></a> [4547463](#4547463) <a name="4547463"></a> <br /> | When you try to run <code>nv action boot-next</code> commands during optimized image upgrade, the commands time out. This does not necessarily mean an issue occurred; the system might still be executing the action.<br>To check that the action command completed before going to the next step to reboot the system:<ol><li>Find the Request ID for the REST API invocation corresponding to the <code>nv action boot-next</code> command by doing a grep for <code>ActionKey.*boot-next</code> in the /var/log/nvued.log</code> file. For example, the value 3 in the <code>Ran Job running ActionKey('&#64;boot-next', '/system/image', (), 3, (('partition', 'partition1'),))</code> line indicates the Request ID.</li><li>Run the <code>curl -u '<username>:\<password\>'  -X GET https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/action/<Request ID> -k</code> command from the shell to show the status of the action command. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>action_success</code>, the action command completed successfully. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>running</code>, the system is still processing. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>action_error</code>, the system encountered an error.</li></ol> | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4546056"></a> [4546056](#4546056) <a name="4546056"></a> <br /> | When an ESI changes from remote to local, the switch does not uninstall remote neighbors from the ASIC. To work around this issue, flap the layer 3 VNI associated with the SVI to clean up stale neighbors from the ASIC. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535749"></a> [4535749](#4535749) <a name="4535749"></a> <br /> | The <code>uc-discards</code> field in the <code>nv show interface <interface> counters qos egress-queue-stats</code> command output is actually the number of packets discarded per queue, but it is wrongly interpreted as bytes. To work around this issue, convert the data shown in bytes to packets by multiplying by 1024 if the data is in KB, 1024x1024 if the data is in MB, and 1024x1024x1024 if the data is in GB. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535699"></a> [4535699](#4535699) <a name="4535699"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.11.3-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4535696"></a> [4535696](#4535696) <a name="4535696"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.12.1-5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4531960"></a> [4531960](#4531960) <a name="4531960"></a> <br /> | The GNMI Subscription to xpath <code>interfaces/interface&#91;name=swp61s0&#93;/state/counters/out-pkts</code> with a high sample interval results in an initial response of zero but in subsequent updates, the value is correct. You do not see this issue when the sample interval is 1 second. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4509255"></a> [4509255](#4509255) <a name="4509255"></a> <br /> | In PTP two-step, the hardware incorrectly modifies the SYNC message correction field. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4508830"></a> [4508830](#4508830) <a name="4508830"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux allows you to add bond ports of mismatched speeds (such as 10G and 25G) to the same LACP bond without error and the bond reports UP.  | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4507163"></a> [4507163](#4507163) <a name="4507163"></a> <br /> | In some cases after a package upgrade with ISSU (warm boot mode), you see continuous errors in the syslog similar to the following:<br><pre>NOTICE  CORE_ASYNC: Error at pre send callback status &#91;Resource is in use&#93;</pre> | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4498428"></a> [4498428](#4498428) <a name="4498428"></a> <br /> | Due to a GCC update in Cumulus Linux 5.14, you might see unexpected log messages, such as <code>BPF: Invalid name</code> when using package upgrade to upgrade to Cumulus Linux 5.14. You can ignore these messages. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4495383"></a> [4495383](#4495383) <a name="4495383"></a> <br /> | NVUE configuration yaml file translation converts unset commands to set commands because the translation logic expects only set commands.  | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4495231"></a> [4495231](#4495231) <a name="4495231"></a> <br /> | If the hardware clock date is later than 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, the image might fail to install due to a grub-install failure on the EFI filesystem, which is a VFAT filesystem.  As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.  You can then use <code>onie-nos-install</code> to install the image. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4475401"></a> [4475401](#4475401) <a name="4475401"></a> <br /> | External input such as Ctrl+\ might trigger core dumps on the serial console from <code>/bin/login</code>. This behavior is caused by external sources, such as console servers or automation tools, and does not reflect a fault in the operating system. As a potential result, the serial console might become unresponsive. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4475111"></a> [4475111](#4475111) <a name="4475111"></a> <br /> | When you try to convert a layer 3 port that is part of ECMP to a bond member,  you might see a failure in the <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue does not have any functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4472414"></a> [4472414](#4472414) <a name="4472414"></a> <br /> | After you modify the IP address of an SVI, DHCP relay uses an old cached IP address instead of the changed IP address. This occurs because DHCP relay monitors the link state change not IP address change. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4440766"></a> [4440766](#4440766) <a name="4440766"></a> <br /> | When you try to delete a trusted ca key, Cumulus Linux shows an incorrect error message. To remove a trusted ca key, you must unset the key ID, not the key literal. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423248"></a> [4423248](#4423248) <a name="4423248"></a> <br /> | If you unset an interface static IP address when the interface IP gateway is configured, the <code>nv config apply</code> command fails with an <code>ifreload.service</code> error. To work around this issue, unset both the static IP address and gateway together. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423244"></a> [4423244](#4423244) <a name="4423244"></a> <br /> | When you enable, then disable adaptive routing, the BGP neighbors might go down because of an unresolved MAC address. To work around this issue, configure another attribute on the interface. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423175"></a> [4423175](#4423175) <a name="4423175"></a> <br /> | When you configure an API port with a TCP port already in use, the <code>nginx</code> server fails to restart. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4413589"></a> [4413589](#4413589) <a name="4413589"></a> <br /> | A MAC-only EVPN type-2 route is wrongly advertised with the layer 3 VNI label in the BGP NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information). Although this does not have any functional impact, it is not the desired RFC behavior. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4398031"></a> [4398031](#4398031) <a name="4398031"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5400 switch, if the PTP slave port is swp66 and is operating at 1Gbps, the  PTP mean path delay value might be reported as a negative value.  | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4343690"></a> [4343690](#4343690) <a name="4343690"></a> <br /> | The Swagger UI for the Cumulus OpenAPI model is not rendering correctly (https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux-512/api/index.html#). The interface shows screaming emojis and <code>Could not render</code>.  | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4337278"></a> [4337278](#4337278) <a name="4337278"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, statically configured VXLAN entries age out after a peerlink flap. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4329931"></a> [4329931](#4329931) <a name="4329931"></a> <br /> | In previous releases, Cumulus Linux incorrectly allowed SyncE and PPS In features to be enabled at the same time. Upgrading systems with both features configured using NVUE to 5.12.0 or higher results in a failure to apply the startup configuration as part of the first boot of the upgraded version. To work around the issue, unset one of the features before you upgrade. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4309876"></a> [4309876](#4309876) <a name="4309876"></a> <br /> | When you configure an invalid switch port (swp), NVUE adds the invalid configuration instead of rejecting it. The invalid interface in the configuration does not have any functional impact. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4308857"></a> [4308857](#4308857) <a name="4308857"></a> <br /> | When you use <code>tls_crlcheck</code> in the <code>/etc/nslcd.conf</code> file, the optional <code>nslcd</code> service fails due to a missing library. | 5.9.2-5.9.3, 5.12.0-5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4294156"></a> [4294156](#4294156) <a name="4294156"></a> <br /> | After you clear the RoCE counters with the <code>nv action clear interface <interface-id> qos roce counters</code> command, the <code>buffer-max-usage</code> counters in the <code>nv show interface <interface-id> qos roce counters</code> command output do not show updated (cleared) values. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4277042"></a> [4277042](#4277042) <a name="4277042"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5600 switch, you see low power alarms immediately after a reboot. The alarms disappear after showing up initially. Certain modules typically show low power alarms on initialization. No action is needed. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4249096"></a> [4249096](#4249096) <a name="4249096"></a> <br /> | Binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.3.1 to 5.12.0 and later is not supported. To work around this issue, perform a binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.3.1 to 5.9.0, then perform a binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 5.9.0 to 5.12.0 or later. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4236419"></a> [4236419](#4236419) <a name="4236419"></a> <br /> | On the Spectrum-3 switch, the PTP offset for 25GbE fluctuates within a range of plus or minus 50 nanoseconds beyond the expected values. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4214678"></a> [4214678](#4214678) <a name="4214678"></a> <br /> | Changes to open telemetry configuration or export states restarts the telemetry service and resets all health metrics. | 5.12.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4177067"></a> [4177067](#4177067) <a name="4177067"></a> <br /> | When performing a package upgrade, <code>nslcd</code> installation might open an interactive dialog to configure <code>nslcd.conf </code>.<br>To avoid this interactive dialog, set the <code>DEBIAN_FRONTEND</code> environment variable to <code>noninteractive</code>. For example:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo apt-get update<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" upgrade</pre> | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4154839"></a> [4154839](#4154839) <a name="4154839"></a> <br /> | When you run certain SDK commands (such as <code>sudo sx_api_port_counter_dump_all.py</code> or <code>sx_api_fdb_dump</code>) first as the cumulus user, then with <code>sudo</code>, you see the following error:<br><pre>PermissionError: Errno 13&#93; Permission denied: '/tmp/python_err_log.txt'</pre><br>To resolve this issue, run the <code>rm -rf /tmp/python_err_log.txt</code> command. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4142857"></a> [4142857](#4142857) <a name="4142857"></a> <br /> | The switch drops PTP packets received with extra ethernet padding and you see syslog <code>&#91;ptp4l.ERR&#93; messages. | 5.10.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4139511"></a> [4139511](#4139511) <a name="4139511"></a> <br /> | When you generate the cl-support file on the Spectrum-4 switch, the following messages appear on the serial console. You can safely ignore this issue.<br><pre>&#91; 1903.595131&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br>&#91; 1903.601089&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=query)<br>&#91; 1903.609961&#93; hwmon hwmon28: Failed to query module temperature thresholds<br>&#91; 1903.846724&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br>&#91; 1903.852689&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=query)<br>&#91; 1903.861573&#93; hwmon hwmon28: Failed to query module temperature</pre> | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4134447"></a> [4134447](#4134447) <a name="4134447"></a> <br /> | The journal logs might include the error message <code>ERR kernel: &#91;    7.453789&#93; usb usb2-port2: connect-debounce failed</code>. You can safely ignore this log message. | 5.11.0-5.14.0 | |
