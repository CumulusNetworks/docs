For example, instead of interface {{vlan10}}, the route might install against {{vlan10-v0}}. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.
This issue can occur in the following conditions:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, {{clagd}} restart, {{switchd}} restart, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

<td>On switches with ONIE 5.3.0012 (might be displayed as 2023.11-5.3.0012-115200), reinstalling Cumulus Linux with {{onie-install}} when SecureBoot is enabled fails during CMS verification of a found image.To determine the ONIE version on the switch:
sudo mount LABEL="ONIE-BOOT" /mnt

If the ONIE version is earlier than 5.3.0012 (might be displayed as 2023.11-5.3.0012-115200), either disable SecureBoot during reinstallation, or if SecureBoot is enabled and ONIE finds the image on one of the disks (for example, {{/dev/sda5}}), then fails CMS verification, log into the ONIE shell as root and run the following commands:
onie-stop
mkdir /$devname
mount $devname /$devname
