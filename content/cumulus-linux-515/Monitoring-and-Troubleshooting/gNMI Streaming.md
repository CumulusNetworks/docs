You can use {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnmi" text="gRPC Network Management Interface">}} (gNMI) to collect system metrics and export the data to a gNMI client.

Cumulus Linux supports:
- {{<link url="/#gnmi-with-cumulus-linux" text="gNMI with Cumulus Linux">}}, where Cumulus Linux includes the gNMI agent that listens over port 9339.
- {{<link url="/#gnmi-with-netq" text="gNMI with NetQ">}}, where the `netq-agent` package includes the gNMI agent that listens over port 9339.

{{%notice note%}}
To use both gNMI streaming with Cumulus Linux and gNMI streaming with NetQ, you must use different ports.

## gNMI with Cumulus Linux

This section discusses how to configure and use gNMI with Cumulus Linux. To configure and use gNMI with NetQ, see {{<link url="/#gnmi-with-netq" text="gNMI with NetQ">}}.

{{%notice note%}}
- When you enable gNMI with Cumulus Linux, do **not** enable and use {{<link url="Open-Telemetry-Export" text="Open Telemetry">}}.
- Switches with the Spectrum 1 ASIC do not support gNMI streaming.
{{%/notice%}}

Cumulus Linux supports both gNMI dial-in mode, where a collector can start a connection with the switch to collect available statistics, and gNMI dial-out mode, where the switch streams statistics and exports them to a collector.

### Configure gNMI Dial-in Mode

In dial-in telemetry mode, the data collector initiates the <span class="a-tooltip">[gRPC](## "Remote Procedure Calls")</span> connection, the Cumulus Linux switch assumes the role of the gRPC server and the receiver (collector) is the client. The switch pushes data to the collector.

To configure gNMI dial-in mode, you must:
- Specify the gNMI server listening address
- Enable the gNMI server.

To configure optional settings for gNMI dial-in mode:
- Specify the listening port. The default port is 9339.
- Enable a TLS certificate for validation.
  - Cumulus Linux uses a self-signed certificate. You can generate your own TLS server certificate and bind it with the gNMI server application.
  - If you need to use mTLS on the gNMI RPC, import the certificate of the CA that signed the gNMI client keys (or the client certificate itself) to the switch and configure the gNMI server to use the certificate. You can also apply a <span class="a-tooltip">[CRL](## "Certificate Revocation List")</span>. Specify either `uri` (a local or remote URI from where to retrieve the crl bundle file) or `data` (for a PEM encoded CRL).

{{%notice note%}}
When you configure a CA certificate, entity certificate, or CRL, the configuration will apply to any new gNMI sessions that establish. Existing dial-in connections will continue to use the prior configuration until they reestablish.
{{%/notice%}}

The following example sets the gNMI server listening address to 10.10.10.1 and the port to 443, and enables the gNMI server:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system gnmi-server listening-address 10.10.10.1
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system gnmi-server port 443
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system gnmi-server state enabled
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

The following example imports and sets the CA certificate `CERT1` and the CRL `crl.crt` for mTLS:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv action import system security ca-certificate CERT1 passphrase mypassphrase uri-bundle scp://user@pass:1.2.3.4:/opt/certs/cert.p12
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system gnmi-server mtls ca-certificate CERT1
cumulus@switch:~$ nv action import system security crl uri scp://user:password@hostname/path/crl.crt
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system gnmi-server mtls crl /etc/ssl/certs/crl.crt
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

### Configure gNMI Dial-out Mode

In dial-out telemetry mode, the Cumulus Linux switch initiates the gRPC connection to the collector through a gRPC tunnel server and assumes the role of the gRPC client.

To configure gNMI dial-out mode, you must:
- Specify the listening address for each tunnel server to which you want to connect. Cumulus Linux supports a maximum of 10 tunnel servers.
- Enable the tunnel server.

To configure optional settings for each tunnel server:
- Specify the target name and target application you want to access. The default target application is GNMI-GNOI.
- Specify the retry interval. The default retry interval is 30 seconds.
- Import and enable a TLS or mTLS certificate for validation. You can also apply a <span class="a-tooltip">[CRL](## "Certificate Revocation List")</span>. For information about importing certificates and CRLs, refer to {{<link url="NVUE-CLI/#security-with-certificates-and-crls" text="Security with Certificates and CRLs">}}.

{{%notice note%}}
When you configure a CA certificate, entity certificate, or CRL, existing dial-out gNMI sessions are disconnected to apply the new certificate configuration.
{{%/notice%}}

The following example sets the listening address for tunnel server SERVER1 to 10.1.1.10, and enables the tunnel server:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 address 10.1.1.10 
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 state enabled 
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

The following example sets the listening address for tunnel server SERVER1 to 10.1.1.10 and the port to 443, the target name to TARGET1, the retry interval to 40, the CA certificate to CACERT1, and enables the tunnel server:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 address 10.1.1.10 
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 port 443 
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 target-name TARGET1 
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 retry-interval 40
cumulus@switch:~$ nv action import system security ca-certificate CACERT1 uri-public-key scp://user@pass:1.2.3.4:/opt/certs/ca-cert.pem uri-private-key scp://user@pass:1.2.3.4:/opt/certs/ca-cert-key.pem
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 ca-certificate CACERT1
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system grpc-tunnel server SERVER1 state enabled 
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

### User Credentials and Authentication

User authentication is enabled by default. gNMI subscription requests must include the user authentication credentials with NVUE API access permissions, either in an HTTP basic authentication header according to RFC7617 or a gRPC metadata header.

### gNMI Client Requests

You can use your gNMI client on a host to request capabilities and data to which the gNMI agent subscribes.

#### Dial-in Mode Examples

The following example shows a basic dial-in mode subscribe request in an HTTP basic authentication header:

```
gnmic subscribe --mode stream -i 10s --tls-cert gnmi_client.crt --tls-key gnmi_client.key -u cumulus -p ******* --auth-scheme Basic -a 192.168.200.3:9339 --prefix "system/cpus/cpu[index=0]" --path "state"
...
```

The following example shows a dial-in mode subscribe request in a gRPC metadata header with authorization information encoded in base64 format:

```
gnmic subscribe --metadata authorization="Basic Y3VtdWx1czpOdmlkaWFSMGNrcyE=" --address 192.168.200.3:9339 --tls-cert cert/umf-crt.pem --tls-key cert/umf-key.pem --encoding proto --mode stream --stream-mode sample --sample-interval 1s --prefix "system/cpus/cpu[index=0]" --path "state"
...
```

The following example shows a dial-in mode subscribe request in a gRPC metadata header with the username and password specified in the request:

```
gnmic subscribe --mode stream -i 10s --tls-cert cert/umf-crt.pem --tls-key cert/umf-key.pem -u cumulus -p NvidiaR0cks! --skip-verify -a  192.168.200.3:9339  --timeout 30s --prefix "system/cpus/cpu[index=0]" --path "state"
```

### gNOI Operational Commands

The gNMI server agent on Cumulus Linux supports <span class="a-tooltip">[gNOI](## "gRPC Network Operations Interface")</span> so that you can run operational tasks from a client, such as switch reboot or file transfer. The gNOI server is enabled when you configure {{<link url="gNMI-Streaming/#configure-gnmi-dial-in-mode" text="gNMI dial-in mode">}}. The gNOI server uses the same listening address, port, TLS configuration, and user credentials as your gNMI server configuration.

Cumulus Linux supports the following OpenConfig gNOI RPCs:

- {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/system/system.proto#L78" text="System Reboot">}}, supporting warm, fast and cold reboot modes. The `reboot` gNOI RPC maps to the `nv action system reboot mode <mode>` command.
- {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/os/os.proto#L139" text="Software Image Retrieval">}}, supporting copy operations of images to the switch. The `install` gNOI RPC maps to the `nv action fetch system image <image>` command.
- {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/os/os.proto#L145" text="Software Image Activation">}}, supporting optimized image installation and activation. The `activate` gNOI RPC maps to the `nv action install system image files <image>`, `nv action boot-next system image other`, and  `nv action system reboot mode <mode> commands if a reboot is requested.
- {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/os/os.proto#L46" text="Software Image Installation">}}
- {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/file/file.proto" text="File Management">}}, supporting retrieval, viewing, or deleting files. The following file management gNOI RPCs are supported:
  - {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/file/file.proto#L34" text="Get">}}, the equivalent of the `nv action upload system file-path [local-path] [remote-url]` command.
  - {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/file/file.proto#L52" text="Put">}}, the equivalent of the `nv action fetch system file-path [local-path][remote-url] [file-permissions]` command.
  - {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/file/file.proto#L57" text="Stat">}}, the equivalent of the `nv action list system file-path [local-path]` command.  
  - {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/main/file/file.proto#L62" text="Remove">}}, the equivalent of the `nv action delete system file-path [local-path]` command.


You can view the number of gNOI RPCs received on the switch with the `nv show system gnmi-server status gnoi-rpc` command.

## gNMI with NetQ

This section discusses how to configure and use gNMI with NetQ. To configure and use gNMI with Cumulus Linux, see {{<link url="/#gnmi-with-cumulus-linux" text="gNMI with Cumulus Linux">}}.

### Configure the gNMI Agent

The `netq-agent` package includes the gNMI agent, which it disables by default. To enable the gNMI agent:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl enable netq-agent.service
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl start netq-agent.service
cumulus@switch:~$ netq config add agent gnmi-enable true
cumulus@switch:~$ netq config restart agent
```

The gNMI agent listens over port 9339. You can change the default port in case you use that port in another application. The `/etc/netq/netq.yml` file stores the configuration.

Use the following commands to adjust the settings:

1. Disable the gNMI agent:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ netq config add agent gnmi-enable false
   ```

2. Change the default port over which the gNMI agent listens:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ netq config add agent gnmi-port <gnmi_port>
   ```

3. Restart the NetQ Agent to incorporate the configuration changes:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ netq config restart agent
   ```

{{%notice note%}}
The gNMI agent relies on the data it collects from the NVUE service. For complete data collection with gNMI, you must enable the NVUE service. To check the status of the `nvued` service, run the `sudo systemctl status nvued.service` command:

```
cumulus@switch:mgmt:~$ sudo systemctl status nvued.service
● nvued.service - NVIDIA User Experience Daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nvued.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2023-03-09 20:00:17 UTC; 6 days ago
```

If necessary, enable and start the service:

```
cumulus@switch:mgmt:~$ sudo systemctl enable nvued.service
cumulus@switch:mgmt:~$ sudo systemctl start nvued.service
```

{{%/notice%}}

### Use the gNMI Agent Only

NVIDIA recommends that you collect data with both the gNMI and NetQ agents. However, if you do not want to collect data with both agents or you are not streaming data to NetQ, you can disable the NetQ agent. Cumulus Linux then sents data only to the gNMI agent.

To disable the NetQ agent:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq config add agent opta-enable false
```

{{%notice note%}}
You cannot disable both the NetQ and gNMI agent. If you enable both agents on Cumulus Linux and a NetQ server is unreachable, the switch does not send the data to gNMI from the following models:
- `openconfig-interfaces`
- `openconfig-if-ethernet`
- `openconfig-if-ethernet-ext`
- `openconfig-system`
- `nvidia-if-ethernet-ext`

WJH, `openconfig-platform`, and `openconfig-lldp` data continue streaming to gNMI in this state. If you are only using gNMI and a NetQ telemetry server does not exist, disable the NetQ agent by setting `opta-enable` to `false`.
{{%/notice%}}

### Supported Subscription Modes

Cumulus Linux supports the following gNMI {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md#3515-creating-subscriptions" text="subscription modes">}}:

- `POLL` mode
- `ONCE` mode
- `STREAM` mode, supported for `ON_CHANGE` subscriptions only

### Collect WJH Data with gNMI

You can export {{<link title="What Just Happened (WJH)" text="What Just Happened (WJH)">}} data from the NetQ agent to your own gNMI client. Refer to the `nvidia-if-wjh-drop-aggregate` reference YANG model, above.

The gNMI Agent supports `Capabilities` and `STREAM` subscribe requests for WJH events.

### WJH Drop Reasons
<!-- vale off -->
The data that NetQ sends to the gNMI agent is in the form of WJH drop reasons. The SDK generates the drop reasons and Cumulus Linux stores them in the `/usr/etc/wjh_lib_conf.xml` file. Use this file as a guide to filter for specific reason types (L1, ACL, and so on), reason IDs, or event severeties.

#### Layer 1 Drop Reasons

<!-- L1 aggregate drops do not have severity column as it's missing from the SDK, and hence it's not exported -->

| Reason ID | Reason | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 10021 | Port admin down | Validate port configuration |
| 10022 | Auto-negotiation failure | Set port speed manually, disable auto-negotiation |
| 10023 | Logical mismatch with peer link | Check cable or transceiver |
| 10024 | Link training failure | Check cable or transceiver |
| 10025 | Peer is sending remote faults | Replace cable or transceiver |
| 10026 | Bad signal integrity | Replace cable or transceiver |
| 10027 | Cable or transceiver is not supported | Use supported cable or transceiver |
| 10028 | Cable or transceiver is unplugged | Plug cable or transceiver |
| 10029 | Calibration failure | Check cable or transceiver |
| 10030 | Cable or transceiver bad status | Check cable or transceiver |
| 10031 | Other reason | Other L1 drop reason|

#### Layer 2 Drop Reasons

| Reason ID | Reason | Severity | Description |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 201 | MLAG port isolation | Notice | Expected behavior |
| 202 | Destination MAC is reserved (DMAC=01-80-C2-00-00-0x) | Error | Bad packet received from the peer |
| 203 | VLAN tagging mismatch | Error | Validate the VLAN tag configuration on both ends of the link |
| 204 | Ingress VLAN filtering | Error | Validate the VLAN membership configuration on both ends of the link |
| 205 | Ingress spanning tree filter | Notice | Expected behavior |
| 206 | Unicast MAC table action discard | Error | Validate MAC table for this destination MAC |
| 207 | Multicast egress port list is empty | Warning | Validate why IGMP join or multicast router port does not exist |
| 208 | Port loopback filter | Error | Validate MAC table for this destination MAC |
| 209 | Source MAC is multicast | Error | Bad packet received from peer |
| 210 | Source MAC equals destination MAC | Error | Bad packet received from peer |

#### Router Drop Reasons

| Reason ID | Reason | Severity | Description |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 301 | Non-routable packet | Notice | Expected behavior |
| 302 | Blackhole route | Warning | Validate routing table for this destination IP |

### gNMI Client Requests

You can use your gNMI client on a host to request capabilities and data to which the Agent subscribes. The examples below use the {{<exlink url="https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md#3515-creating-subscriptions" text="gNMIc client.">}}.

The following example shows a gNMIc `STREAM` request for WJH data:

```
gnmic -a 10.209.37.121:9339 -u cumulus -p ****** --skip-verify subscribe --path "wjh/aggregate/l2/reasons/reason[id=209][severity=error]/state/drop" --mode stream --prefix "/interfaces/interface[name=swp8]/" --target netq

  "time": "2023-03-01T18:25:02.8581468Z",
  "prefix": "interfaces/interface[name=swp8]/wjh/aggregate/l2/reasons/reason[severity=error][id=209]",
  "target": "netq",
  "updates": [
    {
      "Path": "state/drop",
      "values": {
        "state/drop": "[{\"AggCount\":283,\"Dip\":\"0.0.0.0\",\"Dmac\":\"1c:34:da:17:93:7c\",\"Dport\":0,\"DropType\":\"L2\",\"EgressPort\":\"\",\"EndTimestamp\":1677695102,\"FirstTimestamp\":1677695072,\"Hostname\":\"neo-switch01\",\"IngressLag\":\"\",\"IngressPort\":\"swp8\",\"Proto\":0,\"Reason\":\"Source MAC is multicast\",\"ReasonId\":209,\"Severity\":\"Error\",\"Sip\":\"0.0.0.0\",\"Smac\":\"01:00:5e:00:00:01\",\"Sport\":0}]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
{
  "source": "10.209.37.121:9339",
  "subscription-name": "default-1677695197",
  "timestamp": 1677695132988218890,
  "time": "2023-03-01T18:25:32.98821889Z",

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example shows a gNMIc `ONCE` mode request for interface port speed:

```
gnmic -a 10.209.37.121:9339 -u cumulus -p ****** --skip-verify subscribe --path "ethernet/state/port-speed" --mode once --prefix "/interfaces/interface[name=swp1]/" --target netq

  "time": "2023-02-24T16:27:16.962254134Z",
  "target": "netq",
  "updates": [
    {
      "Path": "interfaces/interface[name=swp1]/ethernet/state/port-speed",
      "values": {
        "interfaces/interface/ethernet/state/port-speed": "SPEED_1GB"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example shows a gNMIc `POLL` mode request for interface status:

```
gnmic -a 10.209.37.121:9339 -u cumulus -p ****** --skip-verify subscribe --path "state/oper-status" --mode poll --prefix "/interfaces/interface[name=swp1]/" --target netq
{

  "time": "2023-03-01T04:20:03.153198642Z",
  "prefix": "interfaces/interface[name=swp1]",
  "target": "netq",
  "updates": [
    {
      "Path": "state/oper-status",
      "values": {
        "state/oper-status": "UP"
      }
    }
  ]
}
received sync response 'true' from '10.209.37.123:9339'
{
  "timestamp": 1677644403153198642,
  "time": "2023-03-01T04:20:03.153198642Z",
  "prefix": "interfaces/interface[name=swp1]",
  "target": "netq",
  "updates": [
    {
      "Path": "state/oper-status",
      "values": {
        "state/oper-status": "UP"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Considerations

When using gNMI with Cumulus Linux:
- The minimum sampling interval is 1 second. If you configure a shorter sampling interval, the switch might not behave as expected.
- ModelData, Origin, and Extensions fields are ignored in requests and not set in responses.
