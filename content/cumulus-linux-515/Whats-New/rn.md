## 5.15.1 Release Notes
### Open Issues in 5.15.1

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="4776502"></a> [4776502](#4776502) <a name="4776502"></a> <br /> | When you configure a VRF that does not exist for NTP, the switch attempts to start the NTP service in that VRF and fails instead of indicating that the VRF does not exist. The configuration change does not take effect and NTP continues to work in the current VRF. | 5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4776470"></a> [4776470](#4776470) <a name="4776470"></a> <br /> | In Cumulus Linux 5.15.0, NTP and DNS configuration commands changed from <code>nv set service</code> to <code>nv set system</code>. However, after upgrading the switch to Cumulus Linux 5.15.1, the <code>nv set service</code> command might still appear in the configuration output because a stale <code>nv set service</code> command remains after the configuration is translated during the upgrade. If you save the configuration with the <code>nv config show -o commands</code>, then reapply the configuration with <code>nv config replace</code>, the command fails if the stale <code>nv set service</code> command is present.<br>To workaround this issue, before applying the configuration with <code>nv config replace</code>, remove any stale <code>nv set service</code> commands from the saved configuration file, then reapply the configuration with the <code>nv config replace <config-file></code> command. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4771875"></a> [4771875](#4771875) <a name="4771875"></a> <br /> | When you poll optical module data with <code>ethtool -m</code>, <code>switchd</code> might crash due to a firmware timeout that triggers a fatal health-check failure. | 5.11.1-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4771874"></a> [4771874](#4771874) <a name="4771874"></a> <br /> | When you poll optical module data with <code>ethtool -m</code>, <code>switchd</code> might crash due to a firmware timeout that triggers a fatal health-check failure. | 5.11.1-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4771785"></a> [4771785](#4771785) <a name="4771785"></a> <br /> | NVUE drop counters and ethtool output do not show the packets discarded because the destination MAC address does not match the router MAC address. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4751060"></a> [4751060](#4751060) <a name="4751060"></a> <br /> | If the switch filesystem is overloaded or memory is exhausted, you see very slow responses from the filesystem and the SDK might fail with a fatal error similar to:<br><pre>sxd_kernel: Health-Check: new failure (dev=1, severity='Fatal', cause=10 &#91;'SDK thread issue'&#93;, irisc=255, desc='Health check: SDK thread &#91;sxSniffer&#93; TID &#91;0x7f81cffff6c0&#93; bit &#91;4&#93; does not respond &#91;5&#93; seconds')</pre> | 5.12.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4748176"></a> [4748176](#4748176) <a name="4748176"></a> <br /> | Unsupported hardware modules might cause SDK and firmware health event and traffic loss. | 5.12.1-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4740606"></a> [4740606](#4740606) <a name="4740606"></a> <br /> | When you configure a port with a 802.1x IPv6 profile, then remove 802.1x, the port might block all ingress and egress traffic, including LLDP frames. This behavior is unintended and might impact network visibility and connectivity.<br>To restore normal traffic flow on the affected port, remove the residual traffic-control filters by running the following commands:<br><pre>tc qdisc del dev <swp port> clsact 2>/dev/null<br>tc qdisc del dev <swp port> ingress 2>/dev/null<br>tc qdisc del dev <swp port> egress 2>/dev/null</pre> | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4734606"></a> [4734606](#4734606) <a name="4734606"></a> <br /> | Physical interface based static IPv6 address assignment does not work for DHCPv6 with inbound DHCP requests (discover packets) on an SVI interface. To work around this issue, configure the IPv6 pool for the subnet to assign the IPv6 address from the pool. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4734374"></a> [4734374](#4734374) <a name="4734374"></a> <br /> | The SNMP AgentX subsystem crashes with a segmentation fault when trying to cancel events from within event callbacks due to multiple Agentx reconnecting one after the other on the device. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4732298"></a> [4732298](#4732298) <a name="4732298"></a> <br /> | If you enable debugging for graceful-restart, the BGP service crashes during restart. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4732177"></a> [4732177](#4732177) <a name="4732177"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5610 switch, the <code>nv show platform transceiver</code> command output for 3rd party optics is missing fields such as <code>rx-los</code> and <code>tx-los</code>. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4722369"></a> [4722369](#4722369) <a name="4722369"></a> <br /> | Certain platforms with a SATA disk for NCQ might cause IO errors sending the SSD into read-only mode. You might see ports going down until the switch reboots. There is no observable performance impact due to this issue. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4721298"></a> [4721298](#4721298) <a name="4721298"></a> <br /> | When node or VM migration occurs between the MLAG pair and the EVPN-MH pair, the MLAG MAC database becomes out of sync with kernel FDB. The migrated MAC addresses remain as local in MLAG MAC database whereas in the kernel, all MAC addresses are updated correctly as remote with the layer 2 next hop ID. To work around this issue, flap the MLAG bond interface to clear the MLAG local database. | 5.11.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4714845"></a> [4714845](#4714845) <a name="4714845"></a> <br /> | The switch installs suboptimal routes in the routing table and advertises them out. | 5.9.2-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4709579"></a> [4709579](#4709579) <a name="4709579"></a> <br /> | Using package upgrade in Cumulus Linux 5.15 and earlier might show syslog errors similar to <code>BTF: failed to validate kernel module -22</code>. These syslog errors are largely inconsequential and occur when loading new modules on an older kernel. Kernel modules still function correctly but BTF debug information might be unavailable until the switch reboots after upgrade. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4707967"></a> [4707967](#4707967) <a name="4707967"></a> <br /> | When you use NVUE to configure a user with a username that is used as a group name in the system, you see the following error message:<br><pre>User name {} is already in use as OS group name 'and could not be used as username.</pre> | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4707930"></a> [4707930](#4707930) <a name="4707930"></a> <br /> | When you configure a high number of 802.1x IPv6 profiles, the <code>nv show system dot1x ipv6-profile</code> command might return <code>no data</code>. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv show system dot1x ipv6-profile --applied</code> command. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4706305"></a> [4706305](#4706305) <a name="4706305"></a> <br /> | The gNMI interface statistics collector reports the error <code>Failed to get SRv6 no sid drop counter: No-SID counter not available in syslog</code> even when SRv6 is disabled. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4706274"></a> [4706274](#4706274) <a name="4706274"></a> <br /> | When <code>switchd</code> terminates (on system shutdown or service restart), the switch does not clean up PBR ACL rules that reference ECMP groups before the SDK de-initializes. This causes SDK errors in the cleanup sequence. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4704406"></a> [4704406](#4704406) <a name="4704406"></a> <br /> | TACACS authentication mode is not configured correctly in PAM common authentication and TACACS configuration files, which makes <code>login</code> the authentication mode regardless of the NVUE configuration. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4702667"></a> [4702667](#4702667) <a name="4702667"></a> <br /> | When you run the <code>nv show vrf default router rib</code> command, NVUE returns an ItemDoesNotExist error. This error occurs because the vtysh <code>show ip route vrf default brief json</code> command does not return any output, which propagates through NVUE. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv show vrf default router rib ipv6</code> and <code>nv show vrf default router rib ipv6 route</code> commands instead. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4692400"></a> [4692400](#4692400) <a name="4692400"></a> <br /> | You see the error <code>Failed to get SRv6 no sid drop counter: No-SID counter not available in syslog</code> even when SRv6 is disabled. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4691719"></a> [4691719](#4691719) <a name="4691719"></a> <br /> | NVUE allows you create more than the maximum of 64 destination NAT rules, which results in a configuration error. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4687371"></a> [4687371](#4687371) <a name="4687371"></a> <br /> | On the spectrum-5, switch when a single traffic class is given 100% dwrr, the default global scheduler profile shows traffic class 5,6,7 as dwrr even though the scheduling mode is strict priority. There is no functional impact with this issue. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4667792"></a> [4667792](#4667792) <a name="4667792"></a> <br /> | Usernames longer than 32 characters do not authenticate against the switch. Avoid using long usernames. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4662854"></a> [4662854](#4662854) <a name="4662854"></a> <br /> | If you configure a DSCP match as <code>ANY</code>, the gNMI subscription does not show DSCP as <code>ANY</code>. The OpenConfig model supports only integer DSCP values. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4657192"></a> [4657192](#4657192) <a name="4657192"></a> <br /> | On NVIDIA SN5640 switches, after you configure a port as unsplit, links do not come up while optics are in use. To work around this issue, use copper cables. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4648833"></a> [4648833](#4648833) <a name="4648833"></a> <br /> | Interfaces using PAM4 DAC cables on switches with Spectrum-4 and later might not come up after a link flap or reboot if auto-negotiation is disabled. Auto-negotiation is required for PAM4 DAC cables on these switches. | 5.15.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4608614"></a> [4608614](#4608614) <a name="4608614"></a> <br /> | When setting up SSH keys, you have to run <code>nv config apply</code> twice for the configuration to take effect. | 5.11.3-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4582679"></a> [4582679](#4582679) <a name="4582679"></a> <br /> | If a node has Suppress Route Advertisement enabled and routes are re-learned; for example, when a peer sends the route again due to route policy changes, or you enable or disable graceful shutdown, not all routes are offloaded, which might cause discrepancies in traffic.  | 5.9.4-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4579237"></a> [4579237](#4579237) <a name="4579237"></a> <br /> | If interface statistics telemetry is running on the switch, an <code>interface_stats_collector</code> core file might generate during statistics collection. | 5.11.3-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4556982"></a> [4556982](#4556982) <a name="4556982"></a> <br /> | In the Spanning Tree PVRST environment, when one bridge interface goes down, it causes all the other bridge interfaces to enter a blocking state for approximately ten seconds. Even though the down port is not the root port, all the other bridge ports are flushed and not in service for about ten seconds. | 5.13.1-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4551249"></a> [4551249](#4551249) <a name="4551249"></a> <br /> | The NVUE service might fail during switch upgrade. To work around this issue, stop the <code>sysmonitor</code> with the <code>sudo systemctl stop sysmonitor</code> command, then upgrade the switch with the <code>nv action upgrade system packages to latest</code> command. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4549896"></a> [4549896](#4549896) <a name="4549896"></a> <br /> | When you try to set a VXLAN with a bridge, you see the error <code>sx_sdk: 22985 &#91;BRIDGE&#93; &#91;ERROR  &#93;: Port(0x200A000D)) already added to a bridge</code>. You can safely ignore this error as it doesn't impact switch functionality.  | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4548514"></a> [4548514](#4548514) <a name="4548514"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, and so on.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.9.1-5.9.3, 5.14.0-5.15.1 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4548512"></a> [4548512](#4548512) <a name="4548512"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>.

| <a name="4547463"></a> [4547463](#4547463) <a name="4547463"></a> <br /> | When you try to run <code>nv action boot-next</code> commands during optimized image upgrade, the commands time out. This does not necessarily mean an issue occurred; the system might still be executing the action.<br>To check that the action command completed before going to the next step to reboot the system:<ol><li>Find the Request ID for the REST API invocation corresponding to the <code>nv action boot-next</code> command by doing a grep for <code>ActionKey.*boot-next</code> in the /var/log/nvued.log</code> file. For example, the value 3 in the <code>Ran Job running ActionKey('&#64;boot-next', '/system/image', (), 3, (('partition', 'partition1'),))</code> line indicates the Request ID.</li><li>Run the <code>curl -u '<username>:\<password\>'  -X GET https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/action/<Request ID> -k</code> command from the shell to show the status of the action command. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>action_success</code>, the action command completed successfully. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>running</code>, the system is still processing. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>action_error</code>, the system encountered an error.</li></ol> | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4535806"></a> [4535806](#4535806) <a name="4535806"></a> <br /> | After a factory reset, the switch does not clear the <code>/var/tmp</code> directory, which the switch uses for temporary files. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4535749"></a> [4535749](#4535749) <a name="4535749"></a> <br /> | The <code>uc-discards</code> field in the <code>nv show interface <interface> counters qos egress-queue-stats</code> command output is actually the number of packets discarded per queue, but it is wrongly interpreted as bytes. To work around this issue, convert the data shown in bytes to packets by multiplying by 1024 if the data is in KB, 1024x1024 if the data is in MB, and 1024x1024x1024 if the data is in GB. | 5.11.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4535699"></a> [4535699](#4535699) <a name="4535699"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.11.3-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4535696"></a> [4535696](#4535696) <a name="4535696"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.12.1-5.15.1 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4534357"></a> [4534357](#4534357) <a name="4534357"></a> <br /> | During Cumulus Linux upgrade or downgrade, <code>rsyslog</code> might crash because the management (eth0) port is unavailable, which triggers a use-after-free fault and  produces a cl-support file as a response. | 5.13.1-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4531960"></a> [4531960](#4531960) <a name="4531960"></a> <br /> | The GNMI Subscription to xpath <code>interfaces/interface&#91;name=swp61s0&#93;/state/counters/out-pkts</code> with a high sample interval results in an initial response of zero but in subsequent updates, the value is correct. You do not see this issue when the sample interval is 1 second. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4509255"></a> [4509255](#4509255) <a name="4509255"></a> <br /> | In PTP two-step, the hardware incorrectly modifies the SYNC message correction field. | 5.12.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4508830"></a> [4508830](#4508830) <a name="4508830"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux allows you to add bond ports of mismatched speeds (such as 10G and 25G) to the same LACP bond without error and the bond reports UP.  | 5.11.2-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4501632"></a> [4501632](#4501632) <a name="4501632"></a> <br /> | NVIDIA recommends you wait for approximately 60 seconds after running <code>nv config apply</code> before power cycling the switch so that NVUE database has time to sync to the filesystem.  | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4495383"></a> [4495383](#4495383) <a name="4495383"></a> <br /> | NVUE configuration yaml file translation converts unset commands to set commands because the translation logic expects only set commands.  | 5.13.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4495231"></a> [4495231](#4495231) <a name="4495231"></a> <br /> | If the hardware clock date is later than 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, the image might fail to install due to a grub-install failure on the EFI filesystem, which is a VFAT filesystem.  As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.  You can then use <code>onie-nos-install</code> to install the image. | 5.9.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4475401"></a> [4475401](#4475401) <a name="4475401"></a> <br /> | External input such as Ctrl+\ might trigger core dumps on the serial console from <code>/bin/login</code>. This behavior is caused by external sources, such as console servers or automation tools, and does not reflect a fault in the operating system. As a potential result, the serial console might become unresponsive. | 5.14.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4475111"></a> [4475111](#4475111) <a name="4475111"></a> <br /> | When you try to convert a layer 3 port that is part of ECMP to a bond member,  you might see a failure in the <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue does not have any functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.15.1 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4440766"></a> [4440766](#4440766) <a name="4440766"></a> <br /> | When you try to delete a trusted ca key, Cumulus Linux shows an incorrect error message. To remove a trusted ca key, you must unset the key ID, not the key literal. | 5.13.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4423248"></a> [4423248](#4423248) <a name="4423248"></a> <br /> | If you unset an interface static IP address when the interface IP gateway is configured, the <code>nv config apply</code> command fails with an <code>ifreload.service</code> error. To work around this issue, unset both the static IP address and gateway together. | 5.9.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4423244"></a> [4423244](#4423244) <a name="4423244"></a> <br /> | When you enable, then disable adaptive routing, the BGP neighbors might go down because of an unresolved MAC address. To work around this issue, configure another attribute on the interface. | 5.9.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4423175"></a> [4423175](#4423175) <a name="4423175"></a> <br /> | When you configure an API port with a TCP port already in use, the <code>nginx</code> server fails to restart. | 5.13.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4413589"></a> [4413589](#4413589) <a name="4413589"></a> <br /> | A MAC-only EVPN type-2 route is wrongly advertised with the layer 3 VNI label in the BGP NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information). Although this does not have any functional impact, it is not the desired RFC behavior. | 5.13.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4337278"></a> [4337278](#4337278) <a name="4337278"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, statically configured VXLAN entries age out after a peerlink flap. | 5.12.0-5.15.1 | |
| <a name="4329931"></a> [4329931](#4329931) <a name="4329931"></a> <br /> | In previous releases, Cumulus Linux incorrectly allowed SyncE and PPS In features to be enabled at the same time. Upgrading systems with both features configured using NVUE to 5.12.0 or higher results in a failure to apply the startup configuration as part of the first boot of the upgraded version.

| <a name="4605303"></a> [4605303](#4605303) <a name="4605303"></a> <br /> | The downstream VNI software VXLAN encapsulation path does not derive the source IP address of the outer IP header properly. Instead of using the defined <code>vxlan-local-tunnelip</code> under the loopback interface, it uses the underlay interface on which the packet egresses the VTEP. In a mixed vendor environment, this might lead to a drop on the decapsulating VTEP if it is not an Nvidia Cumulus Linux switch. To work around this issue, use symmetric VNI configuration instead of downstream VNI or use downstream VNI with an unnumbered underlay. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |
