|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="4662854"></a> [4662854](#4662854) <a name="4662854"></a> <br /> | If the DSCP match is configured as "ANY," the gNMI subscription will not show DSCP as "ANY." The OpenConfig model supports only integer DSCP values. | 5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4648833"></a> [4648833](#4648833) <a name="4648833"></a> <br /> | Interfaces using PAM4 DAC cables on Spectrum 4 switches and later might not come up after a link flap or reboot if auto-negotiation is not enabled. Auto-negotiation is required for PAM4 DAC cables on these switches<br /> | 5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4608614"></a> [4608614](#4608614) <a name="4608614"></a> <br /> | When setting up SSH keys, you have to run <code>nv config apply</code> twice for the configuration to take effect. | 5.11.3-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4582679"></a> [4582679](#4582679) <a name="4582679"></a> <br /> | If a node has Suppress Route Advertisement enabled and routes are re-learned; for example, when a peer sends the route again due to route policy changes, or you enable or disable graceful shutdown, not all routes are offloaded, which might cause discrepancies in traffic.  | 5.9.4-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4579237"></a> [4579237](#4579237) <a name="4579237"></a> <br /> | If interface statistics telemetry is running on the switch, an <code>interface_stats_collector</code> core file might generate during statistics collection. | 5.11.3-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4556982"></a> [4556982](#4556982) <a name="4556982"></a> <br /> | In a Spanning Tree PVRST configuration, when one bridge interface goes down, all the other bridge interfaces enter a blocking state for approximately ten seconds. | 5.13.1-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4551249"></a> [4551249](#4551249) <a name="4551249"></a> <br /> | The NVUE service might fail during switch upgrade on Cumulus Linux 5.13.1. To work around this issue, stop the <code>sysmonitor</code> with the <code>sudo systemctl stop sysmonitor</code> command, then upgrade the switch with the <code>nv action upgrade system packages to latest</code> command. | 5.14.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4549896"></a> [4549896](#4549896) <a name="4549896"></a> <br /> | When you try to set a VXLAN with a bridge, you see the error <code>sx_sdk: 22985 &#91;BRIDGE&#93; &#91;ERROR  &#93;: Port(0x200A000D)) already added to a bridge</code>. You can safely ignore this error as it doesn't impact switch functionality.  | 5.14.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4548514"></a> [4548514](#4548514) <a name="4548514"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, and so on.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.9.1-5.9.3, 5.14.0-5.15.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4548512"></a> [4548512](#4548512) <a name="4548512"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI.

| <a name="4547463"></a> [4547463](#4547463) <a name="4547463"></a> <br /> | When you try to run <code>nv action boot-next</code> commands during optimized image upgrade, the commands time out. This does not necessarily mean an issue occurred; the system might still be executing the action.<br>To check that the action command completed before going to the next step to reboot the system:<ol><li>Find the Request ID for the REST API invocation corresponding to the <code>nv action boot-next</code> command by doing a grep for <code>ActionKey.*boot-next</code> in the /var/log/nvued.log</code> file. For example, the value 3 in the <code>Ran Job running ActionKey('&#64;boot-next', '/system/image', (), 3, (('partition', 'partition1'),))</code> line indicates the Request ID.</li><li>Run the <code>curl -u '<username>:\<password\>'  -X GET https://127.0.0.1:8765/nvue_v1/action/<Request ID> -k</code> command from the shell to show the status of the action command. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>action_success</code>, the action command completed successfully. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>running</code>, the system is still processing. If the value of <code>state</code> is <code>action_error</code>, the system encountered an error.</li></ol> | 5.14.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4535806"></a> [4535806](#4535806) <a name="4535806"></a> <br /> | After a factory reset, the switch does not clear the <code>/var/tmp</code> directory, which the switch uses for temporary files. | 5.14.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4535749"></a> [4535749](#4535749) <a name="4535749"></a> <br /> | The <code>uc-discards</code> field in the <code>nv show interface <interface> counters qos egress-queue-stats</code> command output is actually the number of packets discarded per queue, but it is wrongly interpreted as bytes. To work around this issue, convert the data shown in bytes to packets by multiplying by 1024 if the data is in KB, 1024x1024 if the data is in MB, and 1024x1024x1024 if the data is in GB. | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4535699"></a> [4535699](#4535699) <a name="4535699"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.11.3-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4535696"></a> [4535696](#4535696) <a name="4535696"></a> <br /> | When you configure the RADIUS authentication order with <code>local</code> first and <code>radius second</code>, the RADIUS user is authenticated as a default user name.  | 5.12.1-5.15.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4531960"></a> [4531960](#4531960) <a name="4531960"></a> <br /> | The GNMI Subscription to xpath <code>interfaces/interface&#91;name=swp61s0&#93;/state/counters/out-pkts</code> with a high sample interval results in an initial response of zero but in subsequent updates, the value is correct. You do not see this issue when the sample interval is 1 second. | 5.14.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4509255"></a> [4509255](#4509255) <a name="4509255"></a> <br /> | In PTP two-step, the hardware incorrectly modifies the SYNC message correction field. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4507163"></a> [4507163](#4507163) <a name="4507163"></a> <br /> | In some cases after a package upgrade with ISSU (warm boot mode), you see continuous errors in the syslog similar to the following:<br><pre>NOTICE  CORE_ASYNC: Error at pre send callback status &#91;Resource is in use&#93;</pre> | 5.11.2-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4501632"></a> [4501632](#4501632) <a name="4501632"></a> <br /> | NVIDIA recommends you wait for approximately 60 seconds after running <code>nv config apply</code> before power cycling the switch so that NVUE database has time to sync to the filesystem.  | 5.14.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4495383"></a> [4495383](#4495383) <a name="4495383"></a> <br /> | NVUE configuration yaml file translation converts unset commands to set commands because the translation logic expects only set commands.  | 5.13.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4495231"></a> [4495231](#4495231) <a name="4495231"></a> <br /> | If the hardware clock date is later than 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, the image might fail to install due to a grub-install failure on the EFI filesystem, which is a VFAT filesystem.  As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.  You can then use <code>onie-nos-install</code> to install the image. | 5.9.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4475401"></a> [4475401](#4475401) <a name="4475401"></a> <br /> | External input such as Ctrl+\ might trigger core dumps on the serial console from <code>/bin/login</code>. This behavior is caused by external sources, such as console servers or automation tools, and does not reflect a fault in the operating system. As a potential result, the serial console might become unresponsive. | 5.14.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4475111"></a> [4475111](#4475111) <a name="4475111"></a> <br /> | When you try to convert a layer 3 port that is part of ECMP to a bond member,  you might see a failure in the <code>switchd</code> logs. This issue does not have any functional impact. | 5.11.2-5.15.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4440766"></a> [4440766](#4440766) <a name="4440766"></a> <br /> | When you try to delete a trusted ca key, Cumulus Linux shows an incorrect error message. To remove a trusted ca key, you must unset the key ID, not the key literal. | 5.13.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4423248"></a> [4423248](#4423248) <a name="4423248"></a> <br /> | If you unset an interface static IP address when the interface IP gateway is configured, the <code>nv config apply</code> command fails with an <code>ifreload.service</code> error. To work around this issue, unset both the static IP address and gateway together. | 5.9.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4423244"></a> [4423244](#4423244) <a name="4423244"></a> <br /> | When you enable, then disable adaptive routing, the BGP neighbors might go down because of an unresolved MAC address. To work around this issue, configure another attribute on the interface. | 5.9.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4423175"></a> [4423175](#4423175) <a name="4423175"></a> <br /> | When you configure an API port with a TCP port already in use, the <code>nginx</code> server fails to restart. | 5.13.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4337278"></a> [4337278](#4337278) <a name="4337278"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, statically configured VXLAN entries age out after a peerlink flap. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4329931"></a> [4329931](#4329931) <a name="4329931"></a> <br /> | In previous releases, Cumulus Linux incorrectly allowed SyncE and PPS In features to be enabled at the same time. Upgrading systems with both features configured using NVUE to 5.12.0 or higher results in a failure to apply the startup configuration as part of the first boot of the upgraded version. To work around the issue, unset one of the features before you upgrade. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4309876"></a> [4309876](#4309876) <a name="4309876"></a> <br /> | When you configure an invalid switch port (swp), NVUE adds the invalid configuration instead of rejecting it. The invalid interface in the configuration does not have any functional impact. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4308857"></a> [4308857](#4308857) <a name="4308857"></a> <br /> | When you use <code>tls_crlcheck</code> in the <code>/etc/nslcd.conf</code> file, the optional <code>nslcd</code> service fails due to a missing library. | 5.9.2-5.9.3, 5.12.0-5.15.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4294156"></a> [4294156](#4294156) <a name="4294156"></a> <br /> | After you clear the RoCE counters with the <code>nv action clear interface <interface-id> qos roce counters</code> command, the <code>buffer-max-usage</code> counters in the <code>nv show interface <interface-id> qos roce counters</code> command output do not show updated (cleared) values. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4277042"></a> [4277042](#4277042) <a name="4277042"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN5600 switch, you see low power alarms immediately after a reboot. The alarms disappear after showing up initially. Certain modules typically show low power alarms on initialization. No action is needed. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4249096"></a> [4249096](#4249096) <a name="4249096"></a> <br /> | Binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.3.1 to 5.12.0 and later is not supported. To work around this issue, perform a binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 4.3.1 to 5.9.0, then perform a binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 5.9.0 to 5.12.0 or later. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4236419"></a> [4236419](#4236419) <a name="4236419"></a> <br /> | On the Spectrum-3 switch, the PTP offset for 25GbE fluctuates within a range of plus or minus 50 nanoseconds beyond the expected values. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4214678"></a> [4214678](#4214678) <a name="4214678"></a> <br /> | Changes to open telemetry configuration or export states restarts the telemetry service and resets all health metrics. | 5.12.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4177067"></a> [4177067](#4177067) <a name="4177067"></a> <br /> | When performing a package upgrade, <code>nslcd</code> installation might open an interactive dialog to configure <code>nslcd.conf </code>.<br>To avoid this interactive dialog, set the <code>DEBIAN_FRONTEND</code> environment variable to <code>noninteractive</code>. For example:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo apt-get update<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" upgrade</pre> | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4154839"></a> [4154839](#4154839) <a name="4154839"></a> <br /> | When you run certain SDK commands (such as <code>sudo sx_api_port_counter_dump_all.py</code> or <code>sx_api_fdb_dump</code>) first as the cumulus user, then with <code>sudo</code>, you see the following error:<br><pre>PermissionError: Errno 13&#93; Permission denied: '/tmp/python_err_log.txt'</pre><br>To resolve this issue, run the <code>rm -rf /tmp/python_err_log.txt</code> command. | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4142857"></a> [4142857](#4142857) <a name="4142857"></a> <br /> | The switch drops PTP packets received with extra ethernet padding and you see syslog <code>&#91;ptp4l.ERR&#93; messages. | 5.10.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4139511"></a> [4139511](#4139511) <a name="4139511"></a> <br /> | When you generate the cl-support file on the Spectrum-4 switch, the following messages appear on the serial console. You can safely ignore this issue.<br><pre>&#91; 1903.595131&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br>&#91; 1903.601089&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=query)<br>&#91; 1903.609961&#93; hwmon hwmon28: Failed to query module temperature thresholds<br>&#91; 1903.846724&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Could not acquire lock<br>&#91; 1903.852689&#93; mlxsw_minimal 2-0048: Reg cmd access failed (reg_id=900a(mtmp),type=query)<br>&#91; 1903.861573&#93; hwmon hwmon28: Failed to query module temperature</pre> | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |

| <a name="4118970"></a> [4118970](#4118970) <a name="4118970"></a> <br /> | When running PTP, the performance for 100Gx2 and 400Gx8 can have a high offset in up to 1.5% of the sampling.  | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4105127"></a> [4105127](#4105127) <a name="4105127"></a> <br /> | Any sFlow configuration changes that require an <code>hsflowd</code> restart are operational only after an initial delay of 60 seconds. | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4100629"></a> [4100629](#4100629) <a name="4100629"></a> <br /> | NVUE show command outputs show LLDP neighbor changes only after the LLDP update frequency multiplied by the hold time. | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4082210"></a> [4082210](#4082210) <a name="4082210"></a> <br /> | When you change the CPU resource limit with the <code>nv set service control rsyslog resource-limit cpu <value></code> command, the <code>rsyslog</code> agent does not start. To work around this issue, increase the CPU resource limit, then restart the service manually. | 5.11.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4077921"></a> [4077921](#4077921) <a name="4077921"></a> <br /> | You cannot use package upgrade to upgrade from Cumulus Linux 5.9.2 to Cumulus Linux 5.10.1 or later. You must install the Cumulus Linux image instead. | 5.10.1-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4049213"></a> [4049213](#4049213) <a name="4049213"></a> <br /> | When there are routes that point to a single next hop, an ECMP entry is created in the SDK. After the single next hop from the route is removed, the ECMP entry might stay in the SDK until the time the next hop is present in the kernel. | 5.9.2-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4047798"></a> [4047798](#4047798) <a name="4047798"></a> <br /> | Packet distribution based on ECMP hash is not working for VXLAN on top of rack switches where it is encapped. To work around this issue, enable lag hashing with gtp-teid to distribute the VXLAN encapped packets across egress interfaces. | 5.10.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4030380"></a> [4030380](#4030380) <a name="4030380"></a> <br /> | When you roll back interface configuration to the default setting with the <code>nv unset interface</code> command, NVUE removes the complete entry for the interface from the <code>/etc/network/interface</code> file, and puts the interface in admin down. As a result, you cannot configure FEC on the interface at the lower layers. | 5.10.0-5.15.0 | |
| <a name="4005422"></a> [4005422](#4005422) <a name="4005422"></a> <br /> | When you upgrade Cumulus Linux 5.9.1 to Cumulus Linux 5.10 or later with package upgrade, the NTP service stops. To restart the NTP service, enable, then restart the service in the VRF in which it was running with the <code>systemctl enable ntpsec&#64;<vrf></code> and <code>systemctl restart ntpsec&#64;<vrf></code> commands. | 5.10.0-5.15.0 | |

| <a name="4621451"></a> [4621451](#4621451) <a name="4621451"></a> <br /> | Changing the gateway interface IP address on the DHCP relay causes DHCP relay to not forward the packet. To work around this issue, restart the DHCP relay service corresponding to the VRF on which it is running. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4618809"></a> [4618809](#4618809) <a name="4618809"></a> <br /> | When collecting streaming telemetry data for per-process information and statistics from the system, you might see false errors about unavailable process IDs in the logs. | 5.14.0 | |

| <a name="4605303"></a> [4605303](#4605303) <a name="4605303"></a> <br /> | The downstream VNI software VXLAN encapsulation path does not derive the source IP address of the outer IP header properly. Instead of using the defined <code>vxlan-local-tunnelip</code> under the loopback interface, it uses the underlay interface on which the packet egresses the VTEP. In a mixed vendor environment, this might lead to a drop on the decapsulating VTEP if it is not an Nvidia Cumulus Linux switch. To work around this issue, use symmetric VNI configuration instead of downstream VNI or use downstream VNI with an unnumbered underlay. | 5.13.0-5.14.0 | |

| <a name="4597330"></a> [4597330](#4597330) <a name="4597330"></a> <br /> | The switch sends out IPv6 neighbor discovery (ND) router advertisement through an interface that does not have router advertisement enabled. To prevent this issue, do not change or remove the remote-as of a peer-group that is used by BGP unnumbered peers.  To work around this issue, restart FRR. | 5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4597153"></a> [4597153](#4597153) <a name="4597153"></a> <br /> | When you use a gateway-interface configuration with the source IP address as the gateway interface, DHCP Relay is unable to send packets to the DHCP server after flapping the gateway interface. To work around this issue, restart the DHCP Relay service or avoid configuring the gateway interface to be same as the uplink or downlink interface on the DHCP Relay node. | 5.13.1-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4582566"></a> [4582566](#4582566) <a name="4582566"></a> <br /> | The <code>cnp_pg_map</code> and <code>roce_pg_map</code> fields are missing in the NVUE <code>nv show interface <interface> qos roce status</code> and <code>nv show interface qos-roce-status</code> commands. | 5.14.0 | |
