NVUE is an object-oriented, schema driven model of a complete Cumulus Linux system (hardware and software) providing a robust API that allows for multiple interfaces to both view (show) and configure (set and unset) any element within a system running the NVUE software.

This document is a reference for the Cumulus Linux NVUE CLI commands.

## Command Types

The NVUE CLI provides descriptions and examples for the following commands:
- {{<link title="Show Commands" text="nv show">}} commands show various parts of the network configuration.
- {{<link url="Set-and-Unset-Commands" text="nv set and nv unset">}} commands set and unset configuration options on the switch.
- {{<link url="Config-Commands" text="nv config">}} commands manage and apply configurations.
- {{<link url="/Action-Commands" text="nv action">}} commands reset counters and routes, remove MLAG LACP conflicts, and disconnect authorized and authenticated users.
