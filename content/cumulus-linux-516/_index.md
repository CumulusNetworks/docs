## Open Source Contributions

To implement various Cumulus Linux features, NVIDIA has forked various software projects, like CFEngine `Netdev` and some Puppet Labs packages. Some of the forked code resides in the NVIDIA Networking {{<exlink url="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks" text="GitHub repository" >}} and some is available as part of the Cumulus Linux repository as Debian source packages.

NVIDIA has also developed and released new applications as open source. The list of open source projects is on the {{<link title="Cumulus Linux 5.16 Packages" text="Cumulus Linux packages" >}} page.
