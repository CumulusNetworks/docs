This is the Debian prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU m4 macro processor.
GNU `m4' has been originally written by René Seindal, from Denmark,
with subsequent changes by François Pinard and other volunteers on
the Internet. A list of contributors to the GNU program is in the
THANKS file in the source distribution, or appended below in the
binary package.

This package was first put together by Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>
and is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>.

The GNU sources for this release were obtained from

http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.xz

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian/* files.
