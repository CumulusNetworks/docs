<span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[VXLAN](## "Virtual Extensible LAN")</span> routing, sometimes referred to as *inter-VXLAN routing*, provides IP routing between VXLAN VNIs in overlay networks. Cumulus Linux routes traffic using the inner header or the overlay tenant IP address.

Because VXLAN routing is fundamentally routing, you deploy it typically with a control plane, such as Ethernet Virtual Private Network ({{<link url="Ethernet-Virtual-Private-Network-EVPN" text="EVPN">}}). You can also set up static routing for MAC distribution and BUM handling.

For a detailed description of different VXLAN routing models and configuration examples, refer to {{<link url="Ethernet-Virtual-Private-Network-EVPN" text="EVPN">}}.

VXLAN routing supports full layer 3 multi-tenancy; all routing occurs in the context of a {{<link url="Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF" text="VRF">}}. Also, VXLAN routing supports dual-attached hosts where the associated VTEPs function in {{<link url="VXLAN-Active-active-Mode" text="active-active mode">}}.
