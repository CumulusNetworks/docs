 It was never explictly released as GPL, as that would have required
 including the file COPYING which would have been much larger than the
 actual MAKEDEV script (I was also too lazy to find out what incantations
 needed to be made).  However, it is intended to be used as anyone sees
 fit, and the statement under "Copying Policy" is "Freely Redistributable"
 (see MAKEDEV.lsm from any of the releases I made).
 
 The more recent modifications were done by Michael K. Johnson at
 Redhat.  I think the understanding was that he would be taking over the
 maintenance of MAKEDEV (our discussion took place last September).
 
 The only previous history was (according to an old posting to
 comp.os.linux) that I started with Jim Winstead's script.
 
 So, as far as I am concerned, it is consistentwith the Debian FSG.
