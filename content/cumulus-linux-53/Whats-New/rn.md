## 5.3.1 Release Notes
### Open Issues in 5.3.1

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="3647426"></a> [3647426](#3647426) <a name="3647426"></a> <br />None | If BGP <code>remote-as</code> is set to an integer and you try to configure the <code>local-as</code> for a BGP instance, you see the following error:<pre>% AS specified for local as is the same as the remote as and this is not allowed<br /></pre>This configuration is not allowed; it is considered to be eBGP and local preference is not advertised. | 5.0.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3585467"></a> [3585467](#3585467) <a name="3585467"></a> <br /> | NVUE and <code>ip link</code> show traditional bridge VLAN subinterface counts incorrectly. The ingress (Rx) count increments correctly but the egress (Tx) count does not increment. This issues occurs because the hardware does not support transmit counters for a VLAN subinterface; therefore, no statistics from the hardware are updated. Statistics for software forwarded packets show correctly. | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3576949"></a> [3576949](#3576949) <a name="3576949"></a> <br /> | When you run the NVUE <code>nv set service snmp listening-address localhost vrf <vrf-name></code> or <code>nv set service snmp listening-address localhost-v6 vrf <vrf-name></code> command to configure the SNMP listening address, Cumulus Linux applies the listening address to the default VRF instead of the VRF you specify. | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3573800"></a> [3573800](#3573800) <a name="3573800"></a> <br /> | After you apply a change to the router MAC address on an SVI with the <code>ifreload -a</code> command, the old router MAC address still remains in the FDB table. To work around this issue, remove the old router MAC address with the <code>sudo bridge fdb del <old_mac> dev bridge vlan <vlan_id></code> command. | 5.3.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3567708"></a> [3567708](#3567708) <a name="3567708"></a> <br /> | In an EVPN multihoming environment with VRRP, when the master VRRP router fails, the standby router takes around 30 seconds to become active. | 5.3.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3562767"></a> [3562767](#3562767) <a name="3562767"></a> <br /> | ACLs do not process inbound DHCP packets and the packets do not contribute to ACL counters | 5.2.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3560622"></a> [3560622](#3560622) <a name="3560622"></a> <br /> | When you configure a route distinguisher (RD) or a route target (RT) manually for layer 2 VNIs, type-1 routes are not properly updated, type-1 EVI routes with the old RD are not properly withdrawn, and type-1 ES routes do not have the corresponding layer 2 VNI route target updated. | 5.0.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3554231"></a> [3554231](#3554231) <a name="3554231"></a> <br />None | CVE-2023-38408: The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009<br />Mitigation: Do not use ssh-agent forwarding (the man page for ssh_config says that "agent forwarding should be enabled with caution"), or start the ssh-agent program with the -P option to allow only specific PKCS#11 libraries (or none with -P '')<br />For Cumulus Linux 4.3.2, the /usr/bin/ssh-agent program has all permissions turned off (chmod 0) to prevent its execution if a vulnerable version is detected. | 4.0.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3541912"></a> [3541912](#3541912) <a name="3541912"></a> <br /> | Collecting a <code>cl-support</code> file in a high VNI and interface environment can result in an out-of-memory (OOM) event on the switch. An OOM event can cause critical services to restart and might impact traffic. | 5.1.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3496931"></a> [3496931](#3496931) <a name="3496931"></a> <br /> | When you update a prefix list associated with an RP,  the <code>pimd</code> service might crash if the prefix list exists without any prefixes. To work around this issue, ensure that any prefix list associated with an RP includes at least one prefix at all times. | 5.3.1-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3496889"></a> [3496889](#3496889) <a name="3496889"></a> <br /> | When PTP is not enabled on the switch, NVUE <code>nv show ptp</code> commands freeze. This might cause other NVUE commands to fail and the NVUE service to restart. | 5.3.1-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3495630"></a> [3495630](#3495630) <a name="3495630"></a> <br /> | The NVUE <code>nv show service ptp <instance> current</code> command output shows an incorrect value. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv show service ptp <instance> monitor timestamp-log</code> command or the Linux <code>pmc</code> utility. | 5.3.1-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3491259"></a> [3491259](#3491259) <a name="3491259"></a> <br /> | When BGP receives an EVPN type-5 route with a gateway IP overlay attribute, the gateway IP overlay attribute in the <code>attr memory</code> (which is already inserted in the attribute hash) might change. As a result, the modified <code>attr memory</code> might match with another <code>attr</code> in the attribute hash, which produces duplicate entries in the hash table. As a result, BGP might crash when deleting one of the duplicate <code>attr</code> structures.  | 5.0.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3488136"></a> [3488136](#3488136) <a name="3488136"></a> <br /> | When zebra receives route updates that include both a route with a recursive next hop and the route used to resolve that next hop, zebra might mark the route with the recursive next hop as inactive. To work around this issue, reprocess the route updates by running the appropriate clear command for the protocol in use. For example, for BGP, clear inbound routes from the relevant neighbor using the <code>nv action clear vrf <vrf> router bgp neighbor <neighbor> address-family <address-family> in</code> command. | 4.2.1-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3484058"></a> [3484058](#3484058) <a name="3484058"></a> <br /> | When you power on the NVIDIA SN3420 switch with no connected cables, the QSFP ports LEDs light in amber. | 5.3.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3479786"></a> [3479786](#3479786) <a name="3479786"></a> <br /> | The <code>switchd</code> service does not handle certain route and next hop updates, which causes a synchronization loop. For example, in a VRF route leaking configuration, where a next hop group spans across multiple VRFs, when one of the routes is withdrawn and the next hop is no longer used, <code>switchd</code> has problems synchronizing other next hops in the group<br />To work around this issue, disable next hop groups in zebra with the vtysh <code>zebra nexthop proto only</code> command, and then reboot the switch. | 5.3.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3474391"></a> [3474391](#3474391) <a name="3474391"></a> <br /> | The SNMP MIB definition file <code>/usr/share/snmp/mibs/Cumulus-BGPVRF-MIB.txt</code> does not  define the INDEX of the <code>bgpPeerEntry</code> correctly. This issue does not impact SNMP functionality for this MIB. | 4.3.1-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3470941"></a> [3470941](#3470941) <a name="3470941"></a> <br />None | On the NVIDIA SN4700 switch, reversing the upper four lanes on a port does not work and might cause link degradation. If you swap the upper and lower four lanes on a port, the firmware gets stuck. | 5.3.0-5.5.0 | 5.5.1-5.6.0|
| <a name="3467890"></a> [3467890](#3467890) <a name="3467890"></a> <br /> | BGP aggregate routers are not advertised after learning the same route from another protocol. To work around this issue, restart the FRR service or, if possible, don't learn the route from another protocol (use route maps instead). | 5.3.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3466703"></a> [3466703](#3466703) <a name="3466703"></a> <br /> | In rare cases when there is high load, the <code>clagd</code> service might experience a buffer overflow and MLAG bonds stay in a proto-down state on the secondary switch. You see a "NetlinkThread: Netlink overflow" log message and the MLAG state indicates VLAN conflicts between peers. To work around this issue, restart the <code>clagd</code> service with the <code>sudo systemctl restart clagd</code> command on the switch that reports the overflow log message. | 5.2.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3445841"></a> [3445841](#3445841) <a name="3445841"></a> <br /> | FRR does not apply Type-0 ESI configuration for EVPN multihoming bonds consistently after an FRR service reload. This issue occurs because the system MAC address value (<code>es-sys-mac</code>) is only compatible with a 3-byte Ethernet segment ID (<code>es-id</code>) for Type-3 ESIs, but still renders even when the Ethernet segment ID is 10 bytes for Type-0 ESIs. To work around this issue, configure EVPN multihoming bonds with a Type-3 ESI (<code>es-sys-mac</code> plus a 3-byte <code>es-id</code>). | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3434791"></a> [3434791](#3434791) <a name="3434791"></a> <br /> | Changing the <code>ebgp-multihop</code> setting for a BGP peer always resets the peer, even if the configured TTL value matches the existing TTL value of the peer. | 5.3.1-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3432897"></a> [3432897](#3432897) <a name="3432897"></a> <br /> | When you remove the restriction from a TACACS+ mapped user to remove per command authorization, the <code>tacplus-restrict -R</code> command does not restore ownership of restored files correctly. As a result, some commands might fail due to permission errors in the files or directories under the home directory. To work around this issue, run the <code>sudo chown</code> command  to correct the ownership of the affected files and directories. | 5.0.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3429530"></a> [3429530](#3429530) <a name="3429530"></a> <br /> | On the Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 switch, multiple interfaces (in the same PLL quarter) might flap intermittently at the same time. | 4.2.1-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3428677"></a> [3428677](#3428677) <a name="3428677"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, Cumulus Linux does not process next hop updates because the <code>zebra</code> IP routing manager thinks the state of the next hops is unchanged. As a result, route installation fails and remains in a rejected state. | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3424967"></a> [3424967](#3424967) <a name="3424967"></a> <br /> | <code>sudo</code> for TACACS+ users with privilege level 15 does not work when the TACACS+ server is to be reached through the <code>default</code> VRF (with <code>vrf=default</code> set in the <code>/etc/tacplus_servers</code> file). To work around this issue, specify the interface name that the <code>default</code> VRF uses in the <code>vrf=</code> setting of the <code>/etc/tacplus_servers</code> file or run the NVUE <code>nv set system aaa tacacs vrf</code> command. If you don't run either command, a TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can run <code>vrf task exec default sudo ...</code> to execute the <code>sudo</code> command using the TACACS+ server on the <code>default</code> VRF. | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3413827"></a> [3413827](#3413827) <a name="3413827"></a> <br />None | During upgrade, when one MLAG node is upgraded and the other MLAG node is not yet upgraded, permanent neighbors cannot synchronize between MLAG nodes. The <code>clagctl dumppermanentneighs</code> command only shows local neighbors. | 5.0.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3413785"></a> [3413785](#3413785) <a name="3413785"></a> <br /> | To reach the TACACS+ server through the default VRF, you must specify the egress interface you use in the default VRF. Either run the NVUE <code>nv set system aaa tacacs vrf <interface></code> command (for example, <code>nv set system aaa tacacs vrf swp51</code>) or set the <code>vrf=<interface></code> option in the <code>/etc/tacplus_servers</code> file (for example, <code>vrf=swp51</code>). A similar issue might prevent TACACS+ users with privilege level 15 from using <code>sudo</code> if the TACACS+ server is reachable only on the <code>default</code> VRF.  If this occurs, and you do not run the above configuration workaround, the TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can use <code>vrf task exec default sudo ...</code> to execute the <code>sudo</code> command using the TACACS+ server on the <code>default</code> VRF. | 5.0.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3402935"></a> [3402935](#3402935) <a name="3402935"></a> <br />None | For layer 3 interfaces configured on the switch, certain triggers, such as port flaps and subinterface flaps, or when configuring the ports to and from layer 2 and layer 3, cause the dummy internal VLAN to not free up, which can result in exhaustion of the dummy internal VLANs designated for the layer 3 interfaces. When this occurs, you see the following <code>switchd</code> log messages:<pre>ERR dummy internal vlans exhaustedERR cannot allocate vlan for sub-interface</pre> | 5.0.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3393306"></a> [3393306](#3393306) <a name="3393306"></a> <br /> | The <code>python-netaddr</code> package is not preinstalled on the switch, which leads to an error similar to the following when SNMP accesses data from the CUMULUS-BGPVRF-MIB<br /><pre>CUMULUS-BGPVRF-MIB::bgpPeerFsmEstablishedTransitions = No Such Instance currently exists at this OID</pre>To work around this issue, manually install the <code>python-netaddr</code> package with the <code>sudo -E apt-get install python-netaddr</code> command. | 5.3.1-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3390758"></a> [3390758](#3390758) <a name="3390758"></a> <br /> | The <code>neighmgrd</code> service does not enable the snooper unless ARP suppression is enabled on at least one VXLAN interface. This can result in missing ARP and NDP entries if the host does not directly interact with the switch. | 5.3.1-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3389198"></a> [3389198](#3389198) <a name="3389198"></a> <br /> | The NVUE <code>nv unset</code> command does not completely remove IPv6 DNS server configuration<br /> | 5.3.1-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3388067"></a> [3388067](#3388067) <a name="3388067"></a> <br /> | TACACS+ packages in the local <code>apt</code> repository might be out of date; as a result, the upgrade does not install tacacs0 through tacacs15 users in the correct NVUE groups. When you run NVUE commands as a TACACS+ user, the commands fail and you see the error <code>You do not have permission to execute that command</code><br />To obtain the correct packages, install the <code>tacplus-client</code> package and its dependencies from <code>apt.cumulusnetworks.com</code>. | 5.1.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3379873"></a> [3379873](#3379873) <a name="3379873"></a> <br /> | <code>apt source linux</code> fails to download the Linux kernel source code.  To work around this issue, run the <code>sudo apt update && sudo apt install linux-source-5.10</code> command or download the desired version from <code>https://apt.cumulusnetworks.com/repo/pool/cumulus/l/linux/</code> and install it with the <code>sudo dpkg -i $filename</code> command.  The source code in a <code>tar.xz</code> file will then be located in the <code>/usr/src/</code> directory. | 5.2.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3368217"></a> [3368217](#3368217) <a name="3368217"></a> <br />None | When daylight saving time changes, the MLAG <code>initDelay</code> timer resets and all MLAG bonds go down. | 4.4.4-4.4.5, 5.2.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3351953"></a> [3351953](#3351953) <a name="3351953"></a> <br /> | In rare circumstances, attempting to install a Cumulus Linux 5.3 image can fail during installation. The device stops at the (initramfs) prompt. To resume installation, enter the <code>exit</code> command at the (initramfs) prompt. | 5.3.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3351951"></a> [3351951](#3351951) <a name="3351951"></a> <br />None | Currently, the default core dump size limit on Cumulus Linux is 256M but the SDK generates core dumps around 800M. To avoid incomplete core files, you can increase the core dump size limit. | 4.2.1-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3351936"></a> [3351936](#3351936) <a name="3351936"></a> <br /> | Switch fans run at very high speed but the temperature is normal. | 5.2.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3350789"></a> [3350789](#3350789) <a name="3350789"></a> <br /> | NVUE deprecated the port split command options (2x10G, 2x25G, 2x40G, 2x50G, 2x100G, 2x200G, 4x10G, 4x25G, 4x50G, 4x100G, 8x50G) with no backwards compatibility. | 5.0.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3349207"></a> [3349207](#3349207) <a name="3349207"></a> <br /> | The switch does not learn MAC addresses from DHCP packets. When a DHCP enabled host is plugged in for the first time, it tries to obtain an IP address through DHCP. The switch  does not learn the MAC address of the host when it receives these DHCP packets; therefore, the host MAC address is not updated in the local forwarding database and it does not get advertised across EVPN. The switch learns the MAC address when it receives other packets, such as ARP or ND from the host. To work around this issue, either configure a temporary IP address on the host to initiate ARP/ND or enable IPv6, which sends ND after link local address creation. | 5.2.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3347677"></a> [3347677](#3347677) <a name="3347677"></a> <br /> | In an MLAG configuration, when a link failure occurs on the peerlink or the peerlink shuts down, the switch in the secondary role attracts traffic to its local VTEP as it advertises the local VTEP IP address momentarily just before the VXLAN device is protodown. This traffic is dropped for a brief moment (between 5 and 10 seconds) because the MLAG bonds on the secondary switch are already protodown<br />In a proposed fix in the MR !226, we are not flapping the IP on vxlan device on secondary clag device on peerlink down trigger. This ensures smooth traffic flow and no convergence issue seen in system test bed with this fix. | 5.1.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3340890"></a> [3340890](#3340890) <a name="3340890"></a> <br /> | When you run the NVUE <code>nv show interface <interface></code> command, you see an error similar to the following:<pre>Error: GET /nvue_v1/interface/swp45?rev=operational responded with 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR</pre> | 5.3.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3339336"></a> [3339336](#3339336) <a name="3339336"></a> <br /> | The <code>ethtool -m</code> command does not show Digital Optical Monitoring (DOM) for SFP transceivers. To work around this issue, run the <code>l1-show or mlxlink</code> command instead. | 5.2.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3330705"></a> [3330705](#3330705) <a name="3330705"></a> <br /> | When using TACACS+, a TACACS+ server name that returns more than one IP address, such as an IPv6 and IPv4 address, is counted many times against the limit of seven TACACS+ servers, which might cause some of the later listed servers to be ignored as over the limit. To work around this issue, you can set the <code>prefer_ip_version</code> configuration option (the default value is 4) to choose between an IPv4 or IPv6 address if both are present. | 3.7.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3330600"></a> [3330600](#3330600) <a name="3330600"></a> <br /> | The SNMP monitor might fail to send the expected traps. | 5.3.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3329494"></a> [3329494](#3329494) <a name="3329494"></a> <br /> | Ethtool <code>HwIfInDot3FrameErrors</code> (Rx FCS Errors) might lead to an incorrect and very large <code>HwIfInErrors</code> count. To work around this issue, stop the source of the FCS errors, then reset the interface counters. First, run the <code>sudo mst status</code> command to find the device, then run the <code>sudo mlxlink -d <device> -p <port_number> -pc</code> command to reset the interface counters; for example, <code>sudo mlxlink -d /dev/mst/mt53104_pciconf0 -p 39 -pc</code>. | 5.3.1-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3327477"></a> [3327477](#3327477) <a name="3327477"></a> <br /> | If you use <code>su</code> to change to a user specified through TACACS+, the user becomes the local tacacs0 thru tacacs15 user instead of the named user to run <code>sudo</code> commands. As a result, the named user password might not match the local tacacs0 thru tacacs15 user password. | 3.7.0-3.7.16, 4.0.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3322944"></a> [3322944](#3322944) <a name="3322944"></a> <br /> | The <code>ptmd</code> service causes memory leaks. | 5.3.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3308248"></a> [3308248](#3308248) <a name="3308248"></a> <br /> | DHCP packets do not forward over VXLAN interfaces in multicast replication environments. This issue does not affect VXLAN environments using head end replication (HER). | 5.2.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3303084"></a> [3303084](#3303084) <a name="3303084"></a> <br /> | The memory consumption in <code>ptmd</code> can grow when the socket being used for a BFD session needs to be recreated. This is often seen when the route being used to forward the BFD packets is removed; for example, if the connected route is removed when an interface goes down, over which a single hop BFD session is formed. | 5.3.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3301988"></a> [3301988](#3301988) <a name="3301988"></a> <br /> | Some EVPN multihoming show commands might cause BGP to crash if you use the <code>json</code> flag and attempt to reference the default VRF by name. For example, <code>show bgp l2vpn evpn es-vrf json</code>. | 5.0.0-5.3.1 | 5.4.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3301950"></a> [3301950](#3301950) <a name="3301950"></a> <br /> | When upgrading from Cumulus Linux 5.0.0 thru 5.2.1 to Cumulus Linux 5.3.0 or 5.3.1, the <code>babeltrace</code> and <code>python3-babeltrace</code> packages are not added automatically even though they are in the default image in Cumulus Linux 5.3.0 and later.

To work around this issue, reprocess the route updates by running the appropriate clear command for the protocol in use. For example, for BGP, clear inbound routes from the relevant neighbor using the <code>nv action clear vrf <vrf> router bgp neighbor <neighbor> address-family <address-family> in</code> command. | 4.2.1-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|

You see a "NetlinkThread: Netlink overflow" log message and the MLAG state indicates VLAN conflicts between peers. To work around this issue, restart the <code>clagd</code> service with the <code>sudo systemctl restart clagd</code> command on the switch that reports the overflow log message. | 5.2.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|
| <a name="3445841"></a> [3445841](#3445841) <a name="3445841"></a> <br /> | FRR does not apply Type-0 ESI configuration for EVPN multihoming bonds consistently after an FRR service reload. This issue occurs because the system MAC address value (<code>es-sys-mac</code>) is only compatible with a 3-byte Ethernet segment ID (<code>es-id</code>) for Type-3 ESIs, but still renders even when the Ethernet segment ID is 10 bytes for Type-0 ESIs. To work around this issue, configure EVPN multihoming bonds with a Type-3 ESI (<code>es-sys-mac</code> plus a 3-byte <code>es-id</code>). | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |

To work around this issue, specify the interface name that the <code>default</code> VRF uses in the <code>vrf=</code> setting of the <code>/etc/tacplus_servers</code> file or run the NVUE <code>nv set system aaa tacacs vrf</code> command. If you don't run either command, a TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can run <code>vrf task exec default sudo ...</code> to execute the <code>sudo</code> command using the TACACS+ server on the <code>default</code> VRF. | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |

Either run the NVUE <code>nv set system aaa tacacs vrf <interface></code> command (for example, <code>nv set system aaa tacacs vrf swp51</code>) or set the <code>vrf=<interface></code> option in the <code>/etc/tacplus_servers</code> file (for example, <code>vrf=swp51</code>). A similar issue might prevent TACACS+ users with privilege level 15 from using <code>sudo</code> if the TACACS+ server is reachable only on the <code>default</code> VRF.  If this occurs, and you do not run the above configuration workaround, the TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can use <code>vrf task exec default sudo ...</code> to execute the <code>sudo</code> command using the TACACS+ server on the <code>default</code> VRF. | 5.0.0-5.5.1 | 5.6.0|

| <a name="3349207"></a> [3349207](#3349207) <a name="3349207"></a> <br /> | The switch does not learn MAC addresses from DHCP packets. When a DHCP enabled host is plugged in for the first time, it tries to obtain an IP address through DHCP. The switch  does not learn the MAC address of the host when it receives these DHCP packets; therefore, the host MAC address is not updated in the local forwarding database and it does not get advertised across EVPN. The switch learns the MAC address when it receives other packets, such as ARP or ND from the host. To work around this issue, either configure a temporary IP address on the host to initiate ARP/ND or enable IPv6, which sends ND after link local address creation. | 5.2.0-5.4.0 | 5.5.0-5.6.0|
| <a name="3347677"></a> [3347677](#3347677) <a name="3347677"></a> <br /> | In an MLAG configuration, when a link failure occurs on the peerlink or the peerlink shuts down, the switch in the secondary role attracts traffic to its local VTEP as it advertises the local VTEP IP address momentarily just before the VXLAN device is protodown. This traffic is dropped for a brief moment (between 5 and 10 seconds) because the MLAG bonds on the secondary switch are already protodown<br />In a proposed fix in the MR !226, we are not flapping the IP on vxlan device on secondary clag device on peerlink down trigger. This ensures smooth traffic flow and no convergence issue seen in system test bed with this fix. | 5.1.0-5.6.0 | |
