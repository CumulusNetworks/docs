Mitigation: Do not use ssh-agent forwarding (the man page for ssh_config says that "agent forwarding should be enabled with caution"), or start the ssh-agent program with the -P option to allow only specific PKCS#11 libraries (or none with -P '').

hal_mlx_sdk_counter_wrap.c:54 ERR Counter alloc failed: No More Resources

This issue does not have any functional impact to forwarding. Even without the flow counters attached to the ECMP group, packet forwarding works without any issues.
To avoid allocating next hop counters for any new ECMP next hop list update, set {{mlx.stats.ecmp.enable}} to FALSE in the {{/etc/mlx/datapath/stats.conf}} file, then restart {{switchd}} with the {{sudo systemctl reload switchd}} command.</td>

To work around this issue, add tacacs15 to the {{nvapply}} group. Also, add tacacs0 through 14 to the {{nvshow}} group:

sudo usermod -a -G nvapply tacacs15
sudo usermod -a -G nvshow tacacs0
