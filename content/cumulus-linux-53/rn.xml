<td>FRR does not apply Type-0 ESI configuration for EVPN multihoming bonds consistently after an FRR service reload. This issue occurs because the system MAC address value ({{es-sys-mac}} is only compatible with a 3-byte Ethernet segment ID ({{es-id}}) for Type-3 ESIs, but still renders even when the Ethernet segment ID is 10 bytes for Type-0 ESIs. To work around this issue, configure EVPN multihoming bonds with a Type-3 ESI ({{es-sys-mac}} plus a 3-byte {{es-id}}).</td>

A similar issue might prevent TACACS+ users with privilege level 15 from using {{sudo}} if the TACACS+ server is reachable only on the {{default}} VRF.  If this occurs, and you do not run the above configuration workaround, the TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can use {{vrf task exec default sudo ...}} to execute the {{sudo}} command using the TACACS+ server on the {{default}} VRF.</td>

<td>The switch does not learn MAC addresses from DHCP packets. When a DHCP enabled host is plugged in for the first time, it tries to obtain an IP address through DHCP. The switch  does not learn the MAC address of the host when it receives these DHCP packets; therefore, the host MAC address is not updated in the local forwarding database and it does not get advertised across EVPN. The switch learns the MAC address when it receives other packets, such as ARP or ND from the host. To work around this issue, either configure a temporary IP address on the host to initiate ARP/ND or enable IPv6, which sends ND after link local address creation.</td>
