For the ATM-related kernel code, authorship is typically recorded at
the beginning of files. Note that some parts contain code from many
authors, of which only the principal one(s) is or are listed. Kernel
code is released under the conditions described in the file COPYING
in the top-level directory of the kernel (i.e. the GPL, version 2).

The libraries libatm, libatmd, libarequipa (in src/lib/), libsaal (in
src/saal/), and qlib (in src/qgen/) are covered by the more permissive
Library General Public License. See the file COPYING.LGPL for details.

Code generated by qgen is only constrained by whatever usage
restrictions apply to the message structure definition used as input,
i.e. the use of qgen for translation does not create any restrictions.
