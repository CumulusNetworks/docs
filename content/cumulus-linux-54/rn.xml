(Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.
Mitigation: Do not use ssh-agent forwarding (the man page for ssh_config says that "agent forwarding should be enabled with caution"), or start the ssh-agent program with the -P option to allow only specific PKCS#11 libraries (or none with -P '').
For Cumulus Linux 4.3.2, the /usr/bin/ssh-agent program has all permissions turned off (chmod 0) to prevent its execution if a vulnerable version is detected.</td>

The switch learns the MAC address when it receives other packets, such as ARP or ND from the host. To work around this issue, either configure a temporary IP address on the host to initiate ARP/ND or enable IPv6, which sends ND after link local address creation.</td>
