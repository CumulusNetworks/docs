<td>You cannot use NVUE to configure an SNMP view to include a subtree beginning with a period. For example:

$ nv set service snmp-server viewname cumulusOnly included .1.3.6.1.4.1.40310

<td>PAM4 split cables (such as 2x100G, 4x100G, and 4x50G) do not work with a forced speed setting (when auto-negotiation is off) as the default speed enabled is for NRZ mode (such as 100G_4X). To work around this issue,  set the appropriate lanes for forced speed (with auto-negotation off) with the {{ethtool -s swpX speed &lt;port_speed&gt; autoneg off lanes &lt;no_of_lanes&gt;}} command. For example: 

ethtool -s swp1 speed 100000 autoneg off lanes 2
