NVUE enables you to check the status of an interface, and view and clear interface counters. Interface counters provide information about an interface, such as the number of packets intentionally or intentionally dropped, the number of inbound and outbound packets discarded even though the switch detected no errors, the number of inbound and outbound packets not transmitted because of errors, and so on.

## Monitor Interface Status

To check the configuration and statistics for an interface, run the `nv show interface <interface>` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv show interface swp1

## Show Interface Statistics

NVUE provides the following commands to show counters for the interfaces on the switch.

| NVUE Command | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `nv show interface --view counters` |  Shows all statistics for all the interfaces configured on the switch.
| `nv show interface <interface> counters` | Shows all statistics for a specific interface.|
| `nv show interface <interface> counters errors`| Shows error counters for a specific interface. |
| `nv show interface <interface> counters drops` | Shows packet drop counters for a specific interface.|
| `nv show interface <interface> counters pktdist` | Shows packet distribution counters for a specific interface. |

The following example shows all statistics for all the interfaces configured on the switch:

```
cumulus@switch$ nv show interface --view counters
```

The following example shows all statistics for swp1:

```
cumulus@switch$ nv show interface swp1 counters
```

The following example shows error counters for swp1:

```
cumulus@switch$ nv show interface swp1 counters errors
```

{{%notice note%}}
NVUE does not provide statistics for logical interfaces, such as bonds and breakout interfaces. To show VNI counters for a single VXLAN device, run the `nv show nve counters vni <vni>` command.
{{%/notice%}}

## Clear Interface Statistics

To clear counters for all interfaces, run the `nv action clear interface counters` command:

```
cumulus@switch$ nv action clear interface counters
```

To clear the counters for an interface, run the `nv action clear interface <interface> counters` command:

```
cumulus@switch$ nv action clear interface swp1 counters
```

The `nv action clear interface <interface> counters` command does not clear counters in the kernel or hardware.
