  The current LM package contains the most recent version
  of the Latin Modern family of fonts in the PostScript Type 1 and
  OpenType format. The fonts are based on Donald E. Knuth's Computer Modern
  fonts in the PostScript Type 1 format, released into public domain by the
  American Mathematical Society (for the history of the outline version of
  the CM fonts see, e.g., http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/bluesky.html ).
  The project is supported by TeX users groups: CSTUG, DANTE eV, GUST,
  GUTenberg, NTG, and TUG.

              on which the Latin Modern fonts are based.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running t1disasm (from the t1utils package) on
/usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/*.pfb and
/usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cmextra/*.pfb yields:

  Copyright (C) 1997 American Mathematical Society.  All Rights Reserved

  [ Florent Rougon's note: well, for
    /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/cmb{,sy}10.pfb, you will only get
    one space between "Society." and "All" (with tetex-extra 2.0.2-5.1). ;-) ]

The precise distribution conditions for these fonts can be found in
/usr/share/doc/texmf/fonts/bluesky/README from the tetex-doc package. I will
duplicate here the relevant excerpt for your convenience:

  The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the Computer Modern fonts produced
  by and previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. are now
  freely available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
  cooperation of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research
  and Y&Y. Members of this consortium include:

        Elsevier Science
        IBM Corporation
        Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
        Springer-Verlag
        American Mathematical Society (AMS)

  In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be held
  by the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any
  way the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
  distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
  into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
  applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
  faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
  removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
  any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
  Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
  has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
  given a different name.
