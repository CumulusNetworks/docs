This is Debian's prepackaged version of Andrew Tridgell and
Paul Mackerras' rsync utility.

This package provides the rsync program, which is a replacement
for rcp that uses the rsync algorythm to transfer only the
differences between two sets of files.

This package was put together by Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>,
from sources obtained from:
  http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync-2.5.4.tar.gz
The current version was downloaded from:
  https://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.3.tar.gz
on 2018-12-02 by Samuel Henrique <samueloph@debian.org>.

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme by adding various debian/* files.
The only significant change is passing the -4 / -6 options through to ssh.
See the debian/patches/ directory.
