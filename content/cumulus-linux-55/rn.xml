A similar issue might prevent TACACS+ users with privilege level 15 from using {{sudo}} if the TACACS+ server is reachable only on the {{default}} VRF.  If this occurs, and you do not run the above configuration workaround, the TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can use {{vrf task exec default sudo ...}} to execute the {{sudo}} command using the TACACS+ server on the {{default}} VRF.</td>
