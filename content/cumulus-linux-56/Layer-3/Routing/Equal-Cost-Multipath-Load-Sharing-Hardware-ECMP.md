title: Equal Cost Multipath Load Sharing - Hardware ECMP
author: NVIDIA
weight: 770
toc: 3
---
Cumulus Linux enables hardware <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[ECMP](## "Equal Cost Multi Path")</span> by default. Load sharing occurs automatically for all routes with multiple next hops installed. ECMP load sharing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.

## How Does ECMP Work?

ECMP operates only on equal cost routes in the Linux routing table. In the following example, the 10.10.10.3/32 route has four possible next hops installed in the routing table:

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ net show route 10.10.10.3/32
RIB entry for 10.10.10.3/32
===========================
Routing entry for 10.10.10.3/32

  Last update 10:04:41 ago

  * fe80::4ab0:2dff:fea7:7852, via swp53, weight 1
  * fe80::4ab0:2dff:fec8:8fb9, via swp52, weight 1
  * fe80::4ab0:2dff:feff:e147, via swp51, weight 1


FIB entry for 10.10.10.3/32
===========================
10.10.10.3 nhid 108 proto bgp metric 20 
```

For Cumulus Linux to consider routes equal, the routes must:

- Originate from the same routing protocol. Routes from different sources are not considered equal. For example, a static route and an OSPF route are not considered for ECMP load sharing.
- Have equal cost. If two routes from the same protocol are unequal, only the best route installs in the routing table.

When multiple routes are in the routing table, a hash determines through which path a packet follows. To prevent out of order packets, ECMP hashes on a per-flow basis; all packets with the same source and destination IP addresses and the same source and destination ports always hash to the same next hop. ECMP hashing does not keep a record of packets that hash to each next hop and does not guarantee that traffic to each next hop is equal.

{{%notice note%}}
Cumulus Linux enables the BGP `maximum-paths` setting by default and installs multiple routes. Refer to {{<link url="Optional-BGP-Configuration#ecmp" text="BGP and ECMP">}}.

## Next Hop Groups

ECMP routes resolve to next hop groups, which identify one or more next hops. To view next hop information, run the NVUE `nv show router nexthop rib` or `nv show router nexthop rib <id>` commands, or the `ip nexthop show` or `ip nexthop show <id>` kernel commands.

## ECMP Hashing

You can configure custom hashing to specify what to include in the hash calculation during load balancing between:
- Multiple next hops of a layer 3 route (ECMP hashing).
- Multiple interfaces that are members of the same bond (bond or LAG hashing). For bond hashing, see {{<link url="Bonding-Link-Aggregation/#load-balancing" text="Bonding - Link Aggregation" >}}.

For ECMP load balancing between multiple next hops of a layer 3 route, you can hash on these fields:

|   <div style="width:190px">Field   | Default Setting | NVUE Command | `traffic.conf`|
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| IP protocol | on | `nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash ip-protocol on`<br><br>`nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash ip-protocol off`|`hash_config.ip_prot`|
| Source IP address| on | `nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash source-ip on`<br><br>`nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash source-ip off`|`hash_config.sip`|
| Destination IP address| on | `nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash destination-ip on`<br><br>`nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash destination-ip off`|`hash_config.dip`|

| Inner IP protocol| off | `nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash inner-ip-protocol on`<br><br>`nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash inner-ip-protocol off`|`hash_config.inner_ip_prot` |
| Inner source IP address| off | `nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash inner-source-ip on`<br><br>`nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash inner-source-ip off`|`hash_config.inner_sip` |

| Inner IPv6 flow label | off | `nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash inner-ipv6-label on`<br><br>`nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash inner-ipv6-label off`|`hash_config.inner_ip6_label` |

The following example commands omit the source port and destination port from the hash calculation:

{{< tabs "TabID173 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash source-port off
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash destination-port off
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

{{%notice note%}}
Use the instructions below when NVUE is not enabled. If you are using NVUE to configure your switch, the NVUE commands change the settings in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/nvue_traffic.conf` which takes precedence over the settings in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`.
{{%/notice%}}

1. Edit the `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` file:
   - Uncomment the `hash_config.enable = true` option.
   - Set the `hash_config.sport` and `hash_config.dport` options to `false`.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf
...
# HASH config for  ECMP to enable custom fields
# Fields will be applicable for ECMP hash
# calculation
#Note : Currently supported only for MLX platform
# Uncomment to enable custom fields configured below

#source ip
hash_config.sip = true
#destination ip
hash_config.dip = true
#source port
hash_config.sport = false
#destination port
hash_config.dport = false
...
```

2. Run the `echo 1 > /cumulus/switchd/ctrl/hash_config_reload` command. This command does not cause any traffic interruptions.

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ echo 1 > /cumulus/switchd/ctrl/hash_config_reload
   ```

{{%notice note%}}
Cumulus Linux enables symmetric hashing by default. Make sure that the settings for the source IP and destination IP fields match, and that the settings for the source port and destination port fields match; otherwise Cumulus Linux disables symmetric hashing automatically. If necessary, you can disable symmetric hashing manually in the `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` file by setting `symmetric_hash_enable = FALSE`.

## GTP Hashing

<span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[GTP](## "GPRS Tunneling Protocol")</span> carries mobile data within the core of the mobile operator’s network. Traffic in the 5G Mobility core cluster, from cell sites to compute nodes, have the same source and destination IP address. The only way to identify individual flows is with the GTP <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[TEID](## "Tunnel Endpoint Identifier")</span>. Enabling GTP hashing adds the TEID as a hash parameter and helps the Cumulus Linux switches in the network to distribute mobile data traffic evenly across ECMP routes.

Cumulus Linux supports TEID-based *ECMP hashing* for:
- <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[GTP-U](## "GPRS Tunnelling Protocol User")</span> packets ingressing physical ports.
- VXLAN encapsulated GTP-U packets terminating on egress <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[VTEPs](## "Virtual Tunnel End Points")</span>.

For TEID-based load balancing for traffic on a bond, see {{<link url="Bonding-Link-Aggregation/#GTP Hashing" text="Bonding - Link Aggregation" >}}.

GTP TEID-based ECMP hashing is only applicable if the outer header egressing the port is GTP encapsulated and if the ingress packet is either a GTP-U packet or a VXLAN encapsulated GTP-U packet.

{{%notice note%}}
- Cumulus Linux supports GTP Hashing on NVIDIA Spectrum-2 and later.
- <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[GTP-C](## "GPRS Tunnelling Protocol Control")</span> packets are not part of GTP hashing.
{{%/notice%}}

To enable TEID-based ECMP hashing:

{{< tabs "TabID221 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash gtp-teid on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

To disable TEID-based ECMP hashing, run the `nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash gtp-teid off` command.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

{{%notice note%}}
Use the instructions below when NVUE is not enabled. If you are using NVUE to configure your switch, the NVUE commands change the settings in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/nvue_traffic.conf` which takes precedence over the settings in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`.
{{%/notice%}}

1. Edit the `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` file and change the `lag_hash_config.gtp_teid` parameter to `true`:

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf
   ...
   #GTP-U teid
   hash_config.gtp_teid = true
   ```

2. Run the `echo 1 > /cumulus/switchd/ctrl/hash_config_reload` command. This command does not cause any traffic interruptions.

   ```
   cumulus@switch:~$ echo 1 > /cumulus/switchd/ctrl/hash_config_reload
   ```

To disable TEID-based ECMP hashing, set the `hash_config.gtp_teid` parameter to `false`, then reload the configuration.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

To show that TEID-based ECMP hashing is on, run the command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv show system forwarding ecmp-hash
                   applied  description
-----------------  -------  -----------------------------------
destination-ip     on       Destination IPv4/IPv6 Address
destination-port   on       TCP/UDP destination port
gtp-teid           on       GTP-U TEID
...
```

## Unique Hash Seed

You can configure a unique hash seed for each switch to prevent *hash polarization*, a type of network congestion that occurs when multiple data flows try to reach a switch using the same switch ports.

You can set a hash seed value between 0 and 4294967295. If you do not specify a value, `switchd` creates a randomly generated seed.

To configure the hash seed:

{{< tabs "TabID125 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands">}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set system forwarding hash-seed 50
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

{{< /tab >}}

If you do not enable NVUE, use the instructions below. If you are using NVUE to configure your switch, the NVUE commands change the settings in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/nvue_traffic.conf` which takes precedence over the settings in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`.
{{%/notice%}}

Edit `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` file to change the `ecmp_hash_seed` parameter, then restart `switchd`.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf
...
#Specify the hash seed for Equal cost multipath entries
# and for custom ecmp and lag hash
# Default value: random
# Value Range: {0..4294967295}
ecmp_hash_seed = 50

## Resilient Hashing

In Cumulus Linux, when a next hop fails or you remove the next hop from an ECMP pool, the hashing or hash bucket assignment can change. *Resilient hashing* is an alternate way to manage ECMP groups. Cumulus Linux assigns next hops to buckets using their hashing header fields and uses the resulting hash to index into the table of 2^n hash buckets. Because all packets in a given flow have the same header hash value, they all use the same flow bucket.

{{%notice note%}}
- Resilient hashing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.
- Resilient hashing prevents disruption when you remove next hops but does not prevent disruption when you add next hops.
{{%/notice%}}

The NVIDIA Spectrum ASIC assigns packets to hash buckets and assigns hash buckets to next hops. The ASIC also runs a background thread that monitors buckets and can migrate buckets between next hops to rebalance the load.
- When you remove a next hop, Cumulus Linux distributes the assigned buckets to the remaining next hops.
- When you add a next hop, Cumulus Linux assigns **no** buckets to the new next hop until the background thread rebalances the load.
- The load rebalances when the active flow timer expires only if there are inactive hash buckets available; the new next hop can remain unpopulated until the period set in active flow timer expires.
- When the unbalanced timer expires and the load is not balanced, the thread migrates buckets to different next hops to rebalance the load.

Any flow can migrate to any next hop, depending on flow activity and load balance conditions. Over time, the flow can get pinned, which is the default setting and behavior.

When you enable resilient hashing, Cumulus Linux assigns next hops in round robin fashion to a fixed number of buckets. In this example, there are 12 buckets and four next hops.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-reshash-bucket-assignment.png" >}}

Unlike default ECMP hashing, when you need to remove a next hop, the number of hash buckets does not change.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-reshash-failure.png" >}}

With 12 buckets and four next hops, instead of reducing the number of buckets, which impacts flows to known good hosts, the remaining next hops replace the failed next hop.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-reshash-restore.png" >}}

After you remove the failed next hop, the remaining next hops replace it. This prevents impact to any flows that hash to working next hops.

Resilient hashing does not prevent possible impact to existing flows when you add new next hops. Because there are a fixed number of buckets, a new next hop requires reassigning next hops to buckets.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-reshash-add.png" >}}

As a result, some flows hash to new next hops, which can impact anycast deployments.

Cumulus Linux does *not* enable resilient hashing by default. When you enable resilient hashing, all ECMP groups share 65,536 buckets. An ECMP group is a list of unique next hops that multiple ECMP routes reference.

{{%notice note%}}
An ECMP route counts as a single route with multiple next hops.
{{%/notice%}}

All ECMP routes must use the same number of buckets (you cannot configure the number of buckets per ECMP route).

{{%notice note%}}
A larger number of ECMP buckets reduces the impact on adding new next hops to an ECMP route. However, the system supports fewer ECMP routes. If you install the maximum number of ECMP routes, new ECMP routes log an error and do not install.

You can configure route and MAC address hardware resources depending on ECMP bucket size changes. See {{%link title="Routing#NVIDIA Spectrum Switches" text="NVIDIA Spectrum routing resources" %}}.

To enable resilient hashing:

{{< tabs "TabID384 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands ">}}

Cumulus Linux does not provide NVUE commands for this setting.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

1. Edit the `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` file to uncomment and set the `resilient_hash_enable` parameter to `TRUE`.

   You can also set the `resilient_hash_entries_ecmp` parameter to the number of hash buckets to use for all ECMP routes. On Spectrum switches, you can set the number of buckets to 64, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096. On NVIDIA Spectrum-2 and later, you can set the number of buckets to 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096. The default value is 64.

   ```
   # Enable resilient hashing
   resilient_hash_enable = TRUE

   # Resilient hashing flowset entries per ECMP group
   # 
   # Mellanox Spectrum platforms:
   # Valid values - 64, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096
   #
   # Mellanox Spectrum2/3 platforms
   # Valid values -  64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096
   #
   # resilient_hash_entries_ecmp = 64
   ```

2. {{<link url="Configuring-switchd#restart-switchd" text="Restart">}} the `switchd` service:
<!-- vale off -->
{{<cl/restart-switchd>}}
<!-- vale on -->

3. Resilient hashing in hardware does not work with next hop groups; the switch remaps flows to new next hops when the set of nexthops changes. To work around this issue, configure zebra not to install next hop IDs in the kernel with the following vtysh command:

  ```
  cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
  switch# configure terminal
  switch(config)# zebra nexthop proto only
  switch(config)# exit
  switch# write memory
  switch# exit
  cumulus@switch:~$
  ```

## Adaptive Routing

Adaptive routing is a load balancing mechanism that improves network utilization by selecting routes dynamically based on the immediate network state, such as switch queue length and port utilization.

The benefits of using adaptive routing include:
- The switch can forward RoCE traffic over all the available ECMP member ports to maximize the total traffic throughput.
- For leaf to spine traffic flows, the switch distributes incoming traffic equally between the available spines, which helps to minimize latency and congestion on network resources.
- If the cumulative rate of one or more RoCE traffic streams exceeds the link bandwidth of the individual uplink port, adaptive routing can distribute the traffic dynamically between multiple uplink ports; the available bandwidth for RoCE traffic is not limited to the link bandwidth of the individual uplink port.
- If the link bandwidth of the individual uplink ports is lower than that of the ingress port, RoCE traffic can flow through; the switch distributes the traffic between the available ECMP member ports without affecting the existing traffic.

Cumulus Linux only supports adaptive routing with:
- Switches with Spectrum-2 and later
- {{<link url="RDMA-over-Converged-Ethernet-RoCE" text="RDMA with lossless RoCEv2" >}} unicast traffic
- Layer 3 interfaces and VNIs.
- Interfaces in the default VRF

{{%notice note%}}
- Adaptive routing does not make use of resilient hashing.
- You *cannot* configure adaptive routing on bonds or ports that are part of a bond.
{{%/notice%}}

With adaptive routing, packets route to the less loaded path on a per packet basis to best utilize the fabric resources and avoid congestion for the specific time duration. This mode is more time effective and restricts the port selection change decision to a predefined time.

The change decision for port selection is set to one microsecond; you cannot change it.

Cumulus Linux supports UCMP with adaptive routing; see {{<link title="Unequal Cost Multipath with BGP Link Bandwidth/#ucmp-and-adaptive-routing" text="Unequal Cost Multipath with BGP Link Bandwidth. ">}}

{{%notice note%}}
You must configure adaptive routing on *all* ports that are part of the same ECMP route. Make sure the ports are physical uplink ports.
{{%/notice%}}

### Enable Adaptive Routing

When you enable adaptive routing, Cumulus Linux uses the default profile for your switch ASIC type (`ar-profile-2` for Spectum-4 or `ar-profile-1` for Spectrum-3 and earlier). To change the adaptive routing profile, see {{<link url="#adaptive-routing-profiles" text="Adaptive Routing Profiles">}}, below.

{{< tabs "TabID436 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands ">}}

Run the `nv set interface <interface> router adaptive-routing enable on` command on all the ports that are part of the same ECMP route. NVUE sets adaptive routing on the ports and enables the adaptive routing feature.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp51 router adaptive-routing enable on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp52 router adaptive-routing enable on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

To disable adaptive routing, run the `nv set router adaptive-routing enable off` command. To disable adaptive routing on a specific port, run the `nv set interface <interface> router adaptive-routing enable off` command.

{{%notice warning%}}
Enabling or disabling adaptive routing restarts the `switchd` service, which causes all network ports to reset, interrupts network services, and resets the switch hardware configuration.
{{%/notice%}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf` file:
- Set the `adaptive_routing.enable` parameter to `TRUE` to enable the adaptive routing feature.
- Set the `interface.<port>.adaptive_routing.enable` parameter to `TRUE` to enable adaptive routing on the specified ports.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf
## Global adaptive-routing enable/disable setting 
adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
adaptive_routing.profile = ar-profile-1
adaptive_routing.link_util_threshold_disabled = TRUE 
## Per-port configuration for adaptive-routing
interface.swp51.adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE
interface.swp51.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh = 70

interface.swp52.adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE
interface.swp52.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh = 70
...
```

{{<link url="Configuring-switchd#restart-switchd" text="Restart">}} the `switchd` service:
<!-- vale off -->
{{<cl/restart-switchd>}}
<!-- vale on -->

To disable adaptive routing, set the `adaptive_routing.enable` parameter to `FALSE` in the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf` file.

To disable adaptive routing on a specific port, set the `interface.<port>.adaptive_routing.enable` parameter  to `FALSE` in the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf` file.

### Adaptive Routing Profiles

Cumulus Linux provides these adaptive routing profiles:
- `ar-profile-1` is the default profile for a switch with the Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 ASIC.
- `ar-profile-2` is the default profile for a switch with the Spectrum-4 ASIC.
- `ar-profile-custom` includes adaptive routing settings you can change.

If you want to make changes to a profile, you must configure the custom profile by editing the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing_ar_profile_custom.conf` file. NVUE does not provide commands.

After changing parameter values and saving the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing_ar_profile_custom.conf` file, you must reload `switchd` with the `sudo systemctl reload switchd.service` command.

If you change the `adaptive_routing.ecmp_size` parameter, you must **restart** `switchd` with the `systemctl restart switchd` command.

To apply an adaptive routing profile:

{{< tabs "TabID581 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands ">}}

Run the `nv set router adaptive-routing profile <profile-name>` command. The following example sets the profile to `ar-profile-custom`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set router adaptive-routing profile ar-profile-custom
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

To revert the profile to the default profile for the switch:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv unset router adaptive-routing profile
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

{{%notice note%}}
When you set the profile, NVUE reloads `switchd`.
{{%/notice%}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf` file to set the `adaptive_routing.profile` parameter.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf
# Global adaptive-routing enable/disable setting 
adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
adaptive_routing.profile = ar-profile-custom      
```

Reload `switchd` with the `sudo systemctl reload switchd.service` command.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Link Utilization

Adaptive routing considers a port congested based on the link utilization threshold. The default link utilization threshold percentage on an interface is 70. You can change the link utilization threshold percentage for an interface to a value between 1 and 100.

Link utilization is off by default; you must enable the global link utilization setting to use the link utilization thresholds set on adaptive routing interfaces. You cannot enable or disable link utilization per interface.

{{%notice note%}}
In Cumulus Linux 5.5 and earlier, link utilization is on by default. If you configured link utilization in a previous release, be sure to enable link utilization after you upgrade to Cumulus Linux 5.6.
{{%/notice%}}

{{< tabs "TabID624 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands ">}}

The following example changes enables link utilization and uses the default link utilization threshold percentage of 70:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set router adaptive-routing link-utilization-threshold on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

The following example changes the link utilization threshold percentage to 100 on swp51 and enables link utilization:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp51 router adaptive-routing link-utilization-threshold 100
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set router adaptive-routing link-utilization-threshold on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply
```

{{%notice note%}}
When you enable or disable link utilization, NVUE reloads `switchd`.
{{%/notice%}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

Edit the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf` file to set:
- `interface.<interface>.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh` to a value between 1 and 100.
- `adaptive_routing.link_util_threshold_disabled` to FALSE.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf
## Global adaptive-routing enable/disable setting 
adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
adaptive_routing.profile = ar-profile-1 
adaptive_routing.link_util_threshold_disabled = FALSE 

## Per-port configuration for adaptive-routing 
interface.swp1.adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
interface.swp1.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh = 100 
```

Reload `switchd` with the `sudo systemctl reload switchd.service` command.

{{< /tabs >}}

### Example Configuration

{{< tabs "TabID693 ">}}
{{< tab "NVUE Commands ">}}

The following example enables adaptive routing with the default profile for the switch on swp1 and swp2. Global link utilization is off (the default setting).

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp51 router adaptive-routing enable on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp52 router adaptive-routing enable on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply 
```

The following example enables adaptive routing with the custom profile `ar_profile_custom` on swp51 and swp52, sets the link utilization threshold percentage to 100 on both swp51 and swp52, and enables global link utilization:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set router adaptive-routing profile ar_profile_custom
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp51 router adaptive-routing enable on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp52 router adaptive-routing enable on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp51 router adaptive-routing link-utilization-threshold 100
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set interface swp52 router adaptive-routing link-utilization-threshold 100
cumulus@switch:~$ nv set router adaptive-routing link-utilization-threshold on
cumulus@switch:~$ nv config apply 
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Linux Commands ">}}

The following example enables adaptive routing with the default profile for a switch with the Spectrum-4 ASIC (`ar-profile-2`) on swp1 and swp2. Global link utilization is off (the default setting).

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.d/ad.aptive_routing.conf
## Global adaptive-routing enable/disable setting 
adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
adaptive_routing.profile = ar-profile-2 
adaptive_routing.link_util_threshold_disabled = FALSE

## Per-port configuration for adaptive-routing 
interface.swp51.adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
interface.swp51.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh = 70

interface.swp52.adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
interface.swp52.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh = 70
... 
```

Reload `switchd` with the `sudo systemctl reload switchd.service` command.

The following example enables adaptive routing with the custom profile `ar_profile_custom` on swp51 and swp52, sets the link utilization threshold percentage to 100 on both swp51 and swp52, and enables global link utilization.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.d/adaptive_routing.conf
## Global adaptive-routing enable/disable setting 
adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
adaptive_routing.profile = ar-profile-custom 
adaptive_routing.link_util_threshold_disabled = TRUE 

## Per-port configuration for adaptive-routing 
interface.swp51.adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
interface.swp51.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh = 100

interface.swp52.adaptive_routing.enable = TRUE 
interface.swp52.adaptive_routing.link_util_thresh = 100
```

Reload `switchd` with the `sudo systemctl reload switchd.service` command.

### Show Adaptive Routing Settings

To show adaptive routing settings, run the `nv show router adaptive-routing` command:

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv show router adaptive-routing
                           operational        applied          
--------------------------  -----------------  -----------------

profile                     ar-profile-custom  ar-profile-custom 
```

To show adaptive routing configuration for an interface, run the `nv show interface <interface> router adaptive-routing` command:

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv show interface swp51 router adaptive-routing
                            applied
--------------------------  -------
enable                      on     
link-utilization-threshold  100
```

<!-- vale off -->
## cl-ecmpcalc
<!-- vale on -->
Run the `cl-ecmpcalc` command to determine a hardware hash result. For example, you can see which path a flow takes through a network. You must provide all fields in the hash, including the ingress interface, layer 3 source IP, layer 3 destination IP, layer 4 source port, and layer 4 destination port.

{{%notice note%}}
`cl-ecmpcalc` only supports input interfaces that convert to a single physical port in the port tab file, such as the physical switch ports (swp). You can not specify virtual interfaces like bridges, bonds, or subinterfaces.
{{%/notice%}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-ecmpcalc -i swp1 -s 10.0.0.1 -d 10.0.0.1 -p tcp --sport 20000 --dport 80
ecmpcalc: will query hardware
swp3
```

If you omit a field, `cl-ecmpcalc` fails.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-ecmpcalc -i swp1 -s 10.0.0.1 -d 10.0.0.1 -p tcp

```

When there are multiple routes in the routing table, Cumulus Linux assigns each route to an ECMP *bucket*. When the ECMP hash executes, the result of the hash determines which bucket to use.

In the following example, four next hops exist. Three different flows hash to different hash buckets. Each next hop goes to a unique hash bucket.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-hash-bucket.png" >}}

The addition of a next hop creates a new hash bucket. The assignment of next hops to hash buckets, as well as the hash result, sometimes changes with the addition of next hops.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-hash-bucket-added.png" >}}

With the addition of a new next hop, there is a new hash bucket. As a result, the hash and hash bucket assignment changes, so the existing flows go to different next hops.

When you remove a next hop, the remaining hash bucket assignments can change, which can also change the next hop selected for an existing flow.

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-hash-failure.png" >}}

{{< img src = "/images/cumulus-linux/ecmp-hash-post-failure.png" >}}

A next hop fails, which removes the next hop and hash bucket. It is possible that Cumulus Linux reassigns the remaining next hops.

In most cases, modifying hash buckets has no impact on traffic flows as the switch forwards traffic to a single end host. In deployments where multiple end hosts use the same IP address (anycast), you must use *resilient hashing*.

## Considerations

When the router adds or removes ECMP paths, or when the next hop IP address, interface, or tunnel changes, the next hop information for an IPv6 prefix can change. <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC">[FRR](## "FRRouting")</span> deletes the existing route to that prefix from the kernel, then adds a new route with all the relevant new information. In certain situations, Cumulus Linux does not maintain resilient hashing for IPv6 flows.

To work around this issue, you can enable IPv6 route replacement.

{{%notice info%}}
For certain configurations, IPv6 route replacement can lead to incorrect forwarding decisions and lost traffic. For example, it is possible for a destination to have next hops with a gateway value with the outbound interface or just the outbound interface itself, without a gateway address. If both types of next hops for the same destination exist, route replacement does not operate correctly; Cumulus Linux adds an additional route entry and next hop but does not delete the previous route entry and next hop.
{{%/notice%}}

To enable the IPv6 route replacement option:

1. In the `/etc/frr/daemons` file, add the configuration option `--v6-rr-semantics` to the zebra daemon definition. For example:

    ```
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/frr/daemons
    ...
    vtysh_enable=yes
    zebra_options=" -M cumulus_mlag -M snmp -A 127.0.0.1 --v6-rr-semantics -s 90000000"
    bgpd_options=" -M snmp  -A 127.0.0.1"
    ospfd_options=" -M snmp -A 127.0.0.1"
    ...
    ```
<!-- vale off -->
2. {{<cl/restart-frr>}}
<!-- vale on -->
To verify that IPv6 route replacement, run the `systemctl status frr` command:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ systemctl status frr
