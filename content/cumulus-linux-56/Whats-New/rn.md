## 5.6.0 Release Notes
### Open Issues in 5.6.0

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="3609128"></a> [3609128](#3609128) <a name="3609128"></a> <br /> | When you use <code>vi</code> with root or sudo, visual mode is enabled by default due to a missing <code>vimrc</code> configuration file. This makes it difficult to copy and paste into <code>vi</code> and might introduce a security issue. | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3600588"></a> [3600588](#3600588) <a name="3600588"></a> <br /> | You can't reset the root password by booting into Cumulus Linux single-user recovery mode. To work around this issue, follow the steps in https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux-56/Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/Single-User-Mode-Password-Recovery/. | 5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3590053"></a> [3590053](#3590053) <a name="3590053"></a> <br /> | If you connect a 1G BaseT module to the service port on the NVIDIA SN5600 switch when its peer is down, the link shows as active on one side while its peer is disabled. | 5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3585467"></a> [3585467](#3585467) <a name="3585467"></a> <br /> | NVUE and <code>ip link</code> show traditional bridge VLAN subinterface counts incorrectly. The ingress (Rx) count increments correctly but the egress (Tx) count does not increment. This issues occurs because the hardware does not support transmit counters for a VLAN subinterface; therefore, no statistics from the hardware are updated. Statistics for software forwarded packets show correctly. | 5.5.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3576961"></a> [3576961](#3576961) <a name="3576961"></a> <br /> | The NVUE command to clear all ACL counters at once is not available. To work around this issue, run the <code>cl-acltool -Z all</code> command to reset the statistics for all ACL rules. | 5.5.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3576949"></a> [3576949](#3576949) <a name="3576949"></a> <br /> | When you run the NVUE <code>nv set service snmp listening-address localhost vrf <vrf-name></code> or <code>nv set service snmp listening-address localhost-v6 vrf <vrf-name></code> command to configure the SNMP listening address, Cumulus Linux applies the listening address to the default VRF instead of the VRF you specify. | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3573800"></a> [3573800](#3573800) <a name="3573800"></a> <br /> | After you apply a change to the router MAC address on an SVI with the <code>ifreload -a</code> command, the old router MAC address still remains in the FDB table. To work around this issue, remove the old router MAC address with the <code>sudo bridge fdb del <old_mac> dev bridge vlan <vlan_id></code> command. | 5.3.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3569484"></a> [3569484](#3569484) <a name="3569484"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux assigns an IPv4 and IPv6 loopback address to a VRF interface by default. As a result, ping and route lookups for unique remote IP addresses on different VTEPs might not work if there is no source IP on the switch that belongs to the same subnet. To work around this issue, either remove the loopback address on the VRF with the <code>nv unset vrf <vrf> loopback ip address <address></code> command (only remove the loopback address if you are not running NTP; NTP requires a loopback address to work) or change the <code>ping</code> command to use a source address, such as an SVI address, with the <code>ip vrf exec <VRF> ping <REMOTE_IP> -I <SVI_SRC_IP></code> command. | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3567708"></a> [3567708](#3567708) <a name="3567708"></a> <br /> | In an EVPN multihoming environment with VRRP, when the master VRRP router fails, the standby router takes around 30 seconds to become active. | 5.3.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3566980"></a> [3566980](#3566980) <a name="3566980"></a> <br /> | When running DHCP relay for IPv6 and a downstream interface flaps more than once, relaying might stop working. To recover, restart the <code>dhcrelay6</code> service, making sure the specified downstream interfaces are up and running. | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3560622"></a> [3560622](#3560622) <a name="3560622"></a> <br /> | When you configure a route distinguisher (RD) or a route target (RT) manually for layer 2 VNIs, type-1 routes are not properly updated, type-1 EVI routes with the old RD are not properly withdrawn, and type-1 ES routes do not have the corresponding layer 2 VNI route target updated. | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3549798"></a> [3549798](#3549798) <a name="3549798"></a> <br /> | If you add a VRF, then SSH into that VRF, which is a generated service (for example, <code>sshd&#64;vrfname.service</code>), the service fails as the VRF is not created in time. To work around this issue, configure the VRF first, apply the configuration, then enable the SSH service on the VRF. | 5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3538321"></a> [3538321](#3538321) <a name="3538321"></a> <br /> | In rare cases, an STP topology change on PTP over a VLAN can result in the switch losing the Slave state and one of the ports might remain in an Uncalibrated state. To work around this issue, toggle the port that is in the Uncalibrated state up and down to recover the PTP state so that one of the ports is selected as the Slave. | 5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3534718"></a> [3534718](#3534718) <a name="3534718"></a> <br /> | The BGP command to suppress longer prefixes inside the aggregate address before sending updates (<code>nv set vrf <vrf> router bgp address-family <address-family> aggregate-route <address> summary-only</code> or vtysh <code>router bgp <asn> aggregate-address <address> summary-only</code>) does not suppress more specific routes from being exported into the EVPN routing table and advertised as EVPN type-5 routes. To work around this issue, announce EVPN type-5 routes by adding an additional outbound policy or export policy to filter out the more specific routes. | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3533272"></a> [3533272](#3533272) <a name="3533272"></a> <br /> | If you set an OSPF network and define the subnet using a host address (such as 10.1.1.2/24) instead of the (starting) subnet network address (such as 10.1.1.0/24), you can't unset the prefix with the <code>nv unset vrf default router ospf area <area> network</code> command. Avoid defining the subnet using a host address when setting an OSPF network. | 5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3517739"></a> [3517739](#3517739) <a name="3517739"></a> <br /> | When you connect the SN5600 switch to third party test equipment (such as IXIA) using copper cables, 100G, 200G, 400G, and 800G links do not come up. To work around this issue, use fiber optic cables when testing an SN5600 switch with IXIA for 100G, 200G, 400G, and 800G link speeds. | 5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3463827"></a> [3463827](#3463827) <a name="3463827"></a> <br /> | In an EVPN configuration with PIM-SM for BUM handling, the host behind the DUT does not receive the expected number of BUM packets. Cumulus Linux 5.6 only supports Head-End Replication (HREP) for handling BUM traffic in an EVPN configuration. BUM handling using a PIM-SM Multicast tree is not supported. | 5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3452732"></a> [3452732](#3452732) <a name="3452732"></a> <br /> | The <code>nv set router policy ext-community-list <policy-name> rule <rule-number> ext-community rt <route-target></code> command does not generate the standard based BGP community list. As a result, routes do not match the expected community list. To work around this issue, create a snippet to add the policy configuration to the <code>/etc/frr/frr.conf</code> file, then patch the configuration. For example:<pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo nano frr_policy.yaml- set:<br />   system:<br />     config:<br />       snippet:<br />         frr.conf: \|<br />           bgp extcommunity-list standard EXTCOMMUNITY1 seq 10 permit rt 65102:10</pre><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv config patch frr_policy.yaml</pre> | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3452681"></a> [3452681](#3452681) <a name="3452681"></a> <br /> | When you run the NVUE <code>nv show system aaa tacacs authorization</code> commands to show per command authorization for a specific TACACS+ user privilege level, you see the following error:<pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv show system aaa tacacs authorization 1Error: GET /nvue_v1/system/aaa/tacacs/authorization/1?rev=operational responded with 404 NOT FOUND</pre> | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3445841"></a> [3445841](#3445841) <a name="3445841"></a> <br /> | FRR does not apply Type-0 ESI configuration for EVPN multihoming bonds consistently after an FRR service reload. This issue occurs because the system MAC address value (<code>es-sys-mac</code>) is only compatible with a 3-byte Ethernet segment ID (<code>es-id</code>) for Type-3 ESIs, but still renders even when the Ethernet segment ID is 10 bytes for Type-0 ESIs. To work around this issue, configure EVPN multihoming bonds with a Type-3 ESI (<code>es-sys-mac</code> plus a 3-byte <code>es-id</code>). | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3433577"></a> [3433577](#3433577) <a name="3433577"></a> <br /> | When you use a single VXLAN device (SVD) with MLAG and static VXLAN tunnels, Cumulus Linux incorrectly associates the MAC addresses it learns from the VXLAN fabric to the bridge PVID. This issue can lead to a feedback loop between the <code>clagd</code> service and <code>switchd</code>, and might result in critical CPU usage with an out of memory condition. Do not use an SVD when enabling MLAG in a static VXLAN environment. | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3428677"></a> [3428677](#3428677) <a name="3428677"></a> <br /> | In certain cases, Cumulus Linux does not process next hop updates because the <code>zebra</code> IP routing manager thinks the state of the next hops is unchanged. As a result, route installation fails and remains in a rejected state. | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3424967"></a> [3424967](#3424967) <a name="3424967"></a> <br /> | <code>sudo</code> for TACACS+ users with privilege level 15 does not work when the TACACS+ server is to be reached through the <code>default</code> VRF (with <code>vrf=default</code> set in the <code>/etc/tacplus_servers</code> file). To work around this issue, specify the interface name that the <code>default</code> VRF uses in the <code>vrf=</code> setting of the <code>/etc/tacplus_servers</code> file or run the NVUE <code>nv set system aaa tacacs vrf</code> command. If you don't run either command, a TACACS+ user with privilege level 15 can run <code>vrf task exec default sudo ...</code> to execute the <code>sudo</code> command using the TACACS+ server on the <code>default</code> VRF. | 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3405024"></a> [3405024](#3405024) <a name="3405024"></a> <br /> | You cannot remove PBR map configuration with source and destination rules. To work around this issue, delete the entire PBR map clause. | 5.5.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3395489"></a> [3395489](#3395489) <a name="3395489"></a> <br /> | On a switch running MLAG, when you configure QoS buffer settings, MLAG peering resets. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3368217"></a> [3368217](#3368217) <a name="3368217"></a> <br />None | When daylight saving time changes, the MLAG <code>initDelay</code> timer resets and all MLAG bonds go down. | 4.4.4-4.4.5, 5.2.1-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3362113"></a> [3362113](#3362113) <a name="3362113"></a> <br /> | If you restore an NVUE <code>startup.yaml</code> file after upgrade that includes breakout ports with QoS configuration or you run the <code>nv config patch</code> command to update a configuration with a <code>yaml</code> file that includes breakout ports with QoS configuration, the NVUE configuration fails to apply and subsequent attempts to run <code>nv config apply</code> fail with the following message: <pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv config applyInvalid config &#91;rev_id: 11&#93;<br /> qos config is not supported on following invalid interface: swp1s0. Supported on swp and bond interface types<br /></pre>To work around this issue, run <code>nv unset</code> on the configured QoS settings, then apply the breakout port configuration before you configure QoS. Alternatively, you can remove the QoS configuration from the <code>yaml</code> file and patch it separately after applying the breakout configuration. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3350027"></a> [3350027](#3350027) <a name="3350027"></a> <br /> | If you uninstall dynamic NAT rules and <code>switchd</code> restarts before all the dynamic NAT flows age out and are deleted, you might see dynamic flow deletion errors in <code>switchd.log</code>. These errors do not affect new dynamic NAT flows from new NAT rules. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3347677"></a> [3347677](#3347677) <a name="3347677"></a> <br /> | In an MLAG configuration, when a link failure occurs on the peerlink or the peerlink shuts down, the switch in the secondary role attracts traffic to its local VTEP as it advertises the local VTEP IP address momentarily just before the VXLAN device is protodown. This traffic is dropped for a brief moment (between 5 and 10 seconds) because the MLAG bonds on the secondary switch are already protodown. | 5.1.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3347538"></a> [3347538](#3347538) <a name="3347538"></a> <br /> | When connecting NVIDIA-to-NVIDIA in PAM4, you must enable auto-negotiation. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3345054"></a> [3345054](#3345054) <a name="3345054"></a> <br /> | The NVUE <code>nv show interface <interface> qos</code> command takes a significant time to show output or times out. To work around this issue, use specific QoS commands. For example, to show congestion control information, run the <code>nv show interface <interface> qos congestion-control</code> command. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3341214"></a> [3341214](#3341214) <a name="3341214"></a> <br /> | If you use the NVUE REST API to configure a local user with a hashed password, the user cannot log in and the <code>/etc/nvue.d/startup.yaml</code> file shows the password as plain text. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3329518"></a> [3329518](#3329518) <a name="3329518"></a> <br /> | When using TACACS+, if the <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> file specifies <code>passwd: files tacplus</code> (files is listed before tacplus), a user that is present in both the local <code>/etc/passwd</code> file and the TACACS+ server cannot log into the switch. NVIDIA recommends that when using TACACS+, you list <code>tacplus</code> before <code>files</code> in <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>.  When using NVUE, ensure that <code>tacacs</code> has priority over <code>local</code>. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3327477"></a> [3327477](#3327477) <a name="3327477"></a> <br /> | If you use <code>su</code> to change to a user specified through TACACS+, the user becomes the local tacacs0 thru tacacs15 user instead of the named user to run <code>sudo</code> commands. As a result, the named user password might not match the local tacacs0 thru tacacs15 user password. | 3.7.0-3.7.16, 4.0.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3326659"></a> [3326659](#3326659) <a name="3326659"></a> <br /> | If you have a large number of MAC addresses, they do not age out at the MAC ageing timeout value configured on the switch. It might take up to 30 seconds more for the MAC addresses to age out and be deleted from the hardware. To work around this issue, wait for the ageing timeout value plus 30 seconds to allow for the MAC addresses to age out and be deleted from the hardware. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3308191"></a> [3308191](#3308191) <a name="3308191"></a> <br /> | If you try to set an unsupported interface speed together with FEC, the <code>nv config apply</code> command succeeds but Cumulus Linux ignores the FEC configuration and configures the default FEC setting for the chosen speed. There is no warning or error message. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3269691"></a> [3269691](#3269691) <a name="3269691"></a> <br /> | When you restart the LLDP service, you see a <code>broken pipe</code> error and a log message in the <code>lldpd.service</code> logs. This error does not affect LLDP functionality. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3258232"></a> [3258232](#3258232) <a name="3258232"></a> <br /> | If you use NVUE to configure multiple SNMP listener addresses at the same time, the SNMP service fails to start. To work around this issue, configure multiple SNMP listener addresses one at a time. | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3241567"></a> [3241567](#3241567) <a name="3241567"></a> <br /> | When you apply switch configuration for the first time on a freshly booted switch, you might see the error message <code>Failed to start Hostname Service</code> when you run the <code>nv config apply</code> command after setting the hostname with <code>nv set system hostname</code>. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv config apply</code> command a second time. | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3232091"></a> [3232091](#3232091) <a name="3232091"></a> <br /> | The NVUE <code>nv unset interface <interface> link lanes</code> command does not restore the port lane setting to the default value. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv set interface <interface> link lanes <value></code> command. | 5.4.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3226506"></a> [3226506](#3226506) <a name="3226506"></a> <br /> | The <code>l1-show eth0</code> command does not show port information and is not supported in this release.  | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3221628"></a> [3221628](#3221628) <a name="3221628"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux 5.2.0 and 5.2.1 VX images might include an incorrect entry at the end of <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>, which produces warnings when you run <code>apt update</code>. Remove this entry to avoid these warnings. | 5.2.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3172504"></a> [3172504](#3172504) <a name="3172504"></a> <br /> | When you connect the NVIDIA SN4600C switch to a Spectrum 1 or Spectrum-3 switch with a 40GbE passive copper cable (Part Number: MC2210126-005) on edge ports 1-4 and 61-64, there is an Effective BER of 1E-12 in PHY. | 5.2.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3147782"></a> [3147782](#3147782) <a name="3147782"></a> <br /> | You cannot use NVUE to configure an SNMP view to include a subtree beginning with a period. For example:<pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set service snmp-server viewname cumulusOnly included .1.3.6.1.4.1.40310Error: GET /nvue_v1/service/snmp-server/viewname/cumulusOnly/included?pointers=%5B%22%2Fparameters%22%2C+%22%2Fpatch%2FrequestBody%2Fcontent%2Fapplication~1json%2Fschema%22%2C+%22%2Fpatch%2Fparameters%22%2C+%22%2Fpatch%2Fresponses%2F200%2Flinks%22%5D responded with 404 NOT FOUND</pre>To work around this issue, reference the OID without the preceding period ( <code>.</code> ) in the command. | 5.3.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3145869"></a> [3145869](#3145869) <a name="3145869"></a> <br /> | On a Spectrum-3 switch, the PTP offset in 10GbE changes between +-27. The average offset is around 7. | 5.2.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3135952"></a> [3135952](#3135952) <a name="3135952"></a> <br /> | PAM4 split cables (such as 2x100G, 4x100G, and 4x50G) do not work with a forced speed setting (when auto-negotiation is off) as the default speed enabled is for NRZ mode (such as 100G_4X). To work around this issue,  set the appropriate lanes for forced speed (with auto-negotation off) with the <code>ethtool -s swpX speed <port_speed> autoneg off lanes <no_of_lanes></code> command. For example: <pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo ethtool -s swp1 speed 100000 autoneg off lanes 2</pre> | 5.2.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3122301"></a> [3122301](#3122301) <a name="3122301"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN4700 switch, inserting and removing the PSU might cause loss of frames. | 5.2.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3115242"></a> [3115242](#3115242) <a name="3115242"></a> <br /> | When you configure two VNIs in the same VLAN, ifupdown2  shows a <code>vlan added to two or more VXLANS</code> warning, which is only issued after the VNI is already added to the bridge. This leaves the new VNI in the PVID even if there is already an existing VNI configured in that PVID. | 5.1.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3103821"></a> [3103821](#3103821) <a name="3103821"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN4700 switch, inserting and removing the PSU might cause loss of frames. | 5.2.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3084476"></a> [3084476](#3084476) <a name="3084476"></a> <br /> | The default QOS traffic shaping configuration does not restore after you disable traffic shaping in the <code>/etc/cumulus/datapath/qos/qos_features.conf</code> file. To work around this issue, restart <code>switchd</code>. | 4.4.3, 5.0.0-5.6.0 | 4.4.4-4.4.5|
| <a name="3084027"></a> [3084027](#3084027) <a name="3084027"></a> <br /> | Under a high load, you might see ingress drop counters increase. The drops are classified as <code>HwIfInDiscards</code> in ethtool and shown as <code>ingress_general</code> in hardware. | 4.3.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3071652"></a> [3071652](#3071652) <a name="3071652"></a> <br /> | On rare occasions, after you reboot or restart <code>switchd</code> on a Spectrum 1 switch, any 25G connections with Direct Attach Copper (DAC) cables that connect from the switch to a non-NVIDIA device might flap continuously. To work around this issue, bring the affected link administratively down for a few seconds on the non-NVIDIA device, then bring the link back up. | 4.4.4-4.4.5, 5.1.0-5.6.0 | |
| <a name="3061656"></a> [3061656](#3061656) <a name="3061656"></a> <br /> | When the CPU load is high during a warm boot, bonds with a slow LACP rate fail to forward layer 2 traffic for up to 60 seconds (depending on the duration of the CPU load) and static bonds fail to forward layer 2 traffic for up to 5 seconds. | 5.1.0-5.6.0 | |

For example, in a VRF route leaking configuration, where a next hop group spans across multiple VRFs, when one of the routes is withdrawn and the next hop is no longer used, <code>switchd</code> has problems synchronizing other next hops in the group<br />To work around this issue, disable next hop groups in zebra with the vtysh <code>zebra nexthop proto only</code> command, and then reboot the switch. | 5.3.0-5.5.1 | |
| <a name="3474427"></a> [3474427](#3474427) <a name="3474427"></a> <br /> | On rare occasions, LLDP and other CPU originated IP packets that egress a port might get replicated in the data plane and forwarded out of another port as well. The peer node might discard the unicast packets on the wrong port because of the destination MAC address; however, there might be problems with multicast packets, such as LLDP, which uses a multicast MAC address as the destination MAC address. To work around this issue, reboot the switch. |  | |
