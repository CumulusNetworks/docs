<!-- vale on -->
The Cumulus Linux documentation includes pre-built Try It demos for certain Cumulus Linux features. The Try It demos run a simulation in NVIDIA Air; a cloud hosted platform that works exactly like a real world production deployment. Use the Try It demos to examine switch configuration for a feature. For more information, see {{<link url="Try-It-Pre-built-Demos" text="Try It Pre-built Demos">}}.

## Open Source Contributions

To implement various Cumulus Linux features, NVIDIA has forked various software projects, like CFEngine `Netdev` and some Puppet Labs packages. Some of the forked code resides in the NVIDIA Networking {{<exlink url="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks" text="GitHub repository" >}} and some is available as part of the Cumulus Linux repository as Debian source packages.

NVIDIA has also developed and released new applications as open source. The list of open source projects is on the {{<link title="Cumulus Linux 5.6 Packages" text="Cumulus Linux packages" >}} page.

## Hardware Compatibility List

You can find the most up-to-date hardware compatibility list (HCL) {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/hardware-compatibility-list/" text="here" >}}. Use the HCL to confirm that Cumulus Linux supports your switch model. The HCL lists products by port configuration, manufacturer and SKU part number.
