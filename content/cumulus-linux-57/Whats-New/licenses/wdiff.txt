This is the Debian prepackaged version of GNU wdiff, a program
to compare two files word by word. GNU wdiff was written by
Fran√ßois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

This package was put together by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from:

http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wdiff/wdiff-1.2.2.tar.gz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted of adding various
debian/* files to the distribution.
