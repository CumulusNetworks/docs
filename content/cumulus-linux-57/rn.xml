<td>If a packet containing an all zero source MAC address (00:00:00:00:00:00) is learned on the ASIC, {{switchd}} sends the learn notification to the kernel but the kernel rejects the MAC address as invalid. The ASIC continuously sends the mac-learn notifications, which wastes CPU resources.

<td>The {{nv set router policy ext-community-list &lt;policy-name&gt; rule &lt;rule-number&gt; ext-community rt &lt;route-target&gt;}} command does not generate the standard based BGP community list. As a result, routes do not match the expected community list. To work around this issue, create a snippet to add the policy configuration to the {{/etc/frr/frr.conf}} file, then patch the configuration. For example:

cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano frr_policy.yaml
- set:
    system:
      config:
        snippet:
          frr.conf: |
            bgp extcommunity-list standard EXTCOMMUNITY1 seq 10 permit rt 65102:10


cumulus@switch:~$ nv config patch frr_policy.yaml

<td>FRR does not apply Type-0 ESI configuration for EVPN multihoming bonds consistently after an FRR service reload. This issue occurs because the system MAC address value ({{es-sys-mac}}) is only compatible with a 3-byte Ethernet segment ID ({{es-id}}) for Type-3 ESIs, but still renders even when the Ethernet segment ID is 10 bytes for Type-0 ESIs. To work around this issue, configure EVPN multihoming bonds with a Type-3 ESI ({{es-sys-mac}} plus a 3-byte {{es-id}}).</td>
