Comment: This package was debianized by its author Thomas Koenig
 <ig25@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>, taken over and re-packaged first by Martin
 Schulze <joey@debian.org> and then by Siggy Brentrup <bsb@winnegan.de>,
 and then taken over by Ryan Murray <rmurray@debian.org>.
 .
 In August 2009 the upstream development and Debian packaging were taken over
 by Ansgar Burchardt <ansgar@debian.org> and Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>.
 .
 In August 2015 the upstream development and Debian packaging were taken over
 by Jose M Calhariz <jose@calhariz.com>.
 .
 This may be considered the experimental upstream source, and since there
 doesn't seem to be any other upstream source, the only upstream source.
