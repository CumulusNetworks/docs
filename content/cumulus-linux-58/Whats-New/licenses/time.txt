Comment: 
 This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU time utility.
 `time' is a program that measures many of the CPU resources, such as time and
 memory, that other programs use.  It was written by David Keppel.  It
 was subsequently maintained and improved by David MacKenzie with help
 from Arne Henrik Juul, and Francois Pinard.
 .
 This package was put together by Dirk Eddelbuettel from the previous
 Debian package time-1.6-2 (from ftp.debian.org) and the GNU sources
 for time-1.6.  The package was subsequently maintained and updated by
 Tollef Fog Heen, Salvatore Bonaccorso, and Bob Proulx.
