## 5.8.0 Release Notes
### Open Issues in 5.8.0

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="3702431"></a> [3702431](#3702431) <a name="3702431"></a> <br /> | Traditional SNMP snippets do not take effect unless you first enable SNMP with NVUE <code>nv set service snmp-server enable on</code>  and  <code>nv set service snmp-server listening-address <address></code> commands or the equivalent API commands. | 5.4.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3698482"></a> [3698482](#3698482) <a name="3698482"></a> <br /> | The NVUE <code>nv show system config snippet</code> command does not show any data. This occurs because traditional and flexible snippets represent free-form text and are not suitable to be configured or retrieved with the NVUE CLI. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv show system config snippet -o json</code> or <code>nv show system config snippet -o yaml</code> command. You can also a run a <code>GET /nvue_v1/system/config/snippet </code> REST API method. | 5.7.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3689195"></a> [3689195](#3689195) <a name="3689195"></a> <br /> | When you enable 802.1X auth-fail VLAN on an interface, <code>hostapd</code> doesn't activate auth-fail VLAN unless an explicit <code>Access-Reject</code> response is received. | 5.7.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3685007"></a> [3685007](#3685007) <a name="3685007"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux does not support 802.1X dynamic VLANs on PEAP with MS Windows-based supplicants. | 5.7.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3679478"></a> [3679478](#3679478) <a name="3679478"></a> <br /> | Both the ASIC Monitoring service and the What-Just-Happened service try to initialize the SDK TELE module. Initialization is successful only for the first service to initialize the module and you see error log messages<br />There is no functional impact if a service tries to initialize the module again. | 5.7.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3636266"></a> [3636266](#3636266) <a name="3636266"></a> <br /> | When an unresolved next hop is present in a next hop group, especially over an SVI interface, the switch checks if the neighbor MAC address is in the forwarding table. If the neighbor's MAC address not there, the switch skips this next hop from backend programming and you see the <code>switchd</code> error <code>ERR NH: l3 nhg v6 l3 nhg contains one or more unresolvable nexthops</code>. There is no impact to switch functionality as unresolved neighbors are not programmed in hardware until they are resolved. | 5.7.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3556762"></a> [3556762](#3556762) <a name="3556762"></a> <br /> | On rare occasions, SPT switchover might not happen cleanly in PIM resulting in some dropped packets. If you use PIM-SM to replicate EVPN BUM traffic, you might see a brief drop of multicast traffic before recovering due to normal PIM-SM traffic timeout. | 5.5.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3538321"></a> [3538321](#3538321) <a name="3538321"></a> <br /> | In rare cases, an STP topology change on PTP over a VLAN can result in the switch losing the Slave state and one of the ports might remain in an Uncalibrated state. To work around this issue, toggle the port that is in the Uncalibrated state up and down to recover the PTP state so that one of the ports is selected as the Slave. | 5.6.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3433577"></a> [3433577](#3433577) <a name="3433577"></a> <br /> | When you use a single VXLAN device (SVD) with MLAG and static VXLAN tunnels, Cumulus Linux incorrectly associates the MAC addresses it learns from the VXLAN fabric to the bridge PVID. This issue can lead to a feedback loop between the <code>clagd</code> service and <code>switchd</code>, and might result in critical CPU usage with an out of memory condition. Do not use an SVD when enabling MLAG in a static VXLAN environment. | 5.5.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3368217"></a> [3368217](#3368217) <a name="3368217"></a> <br />None | When daylight saving time changes, the MLAG <code>initDelay</code> timer resets and all MLAG bonds go down. | 4.4.4-4.4.5, 5.2.1-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3362113"></a> [3362113](#3362113) <a name="3362113"></a> <br /> | If you restore an NVUE <code>startup.yaml</code> file after upgrade that includes breakout ports with QoS configuration or you run the <code>nv config patch</code> command to update a configuration with a <code>yaml</code> file that includes breakout ports with QoS configuration, the NVUE configuration fails to apply and subsequent attempts to run <code>nv config apply</code> fail with the message similar to <code>Invalid config &#91;rev_id: 11&#93; qos config is not supported on following invalid interface: swp1s0. Supported on swp and bond interface types</code>. To work around this issue, run <code>nv unset</code> on the configured QoS settings, then apply the breakout port configuration before you configure QoS. Alternatively, you can remove the QoS configuration from the <code>yaml</code> file and patch it separately after applying the breakout configuration. | 5.4.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3350027"></a> [3350027](#3350027) <a name="3350027"></a> <br /> | If you uninstall dynamic NAT rules and <code>switchd</code> restarts before all the dynamic NAT flows age out and are deleted, you might see dynamic flow deletion errors in <code>switchd.log</code>. These errors do not affect new dynamic NAT flows from new NAT rules. | 5.4.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3347538"></a> [3347538](#3347538) <a name="3347538"></a> <br /> | When connecting NVIDIA-to-NVIDIA in PAM4, you must enable auto-negotiation. | 5.4.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3329518"></a> [3329518](#3329518) <a name="3329518"></a> <br /> | When using TACACS+, if the <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> file specifies <code>passwd: files tacplus</code> (files is listed before tacplus), a user that is present in both the local <code>/etc/passwd</code> file and the TACACS+ server cannot log into the switch. NVIDIA recommends that when using TACACS+, you list <code>tacplus</code> before <code>files</code> in <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>.  When using NVUE, ensure that <code>tacacs</code> has priority over <code>local</code>. | 5.4.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3326659"></a> [3326659](#3326659) <a name="3326659"></a> <br /> | If you have a large number of MAC addresses, they do not age out at the MAC ageing timeout value configured on the switch. It might take up to 30 seconds more for the MAC addresses to age out and be deleted from the hardware. To work around this issue, wait for the ageing timeout value plus 30 seconds to allow for the MAC addresses to age out and be deleted from the hardware. | 5.4.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3241567"></a> [3241567](#3241567) <a name="3241567"></a> <br /> | When you apply switch configuration for the first time on a freshly booted switch, you might see the error message <code>Failed to start Hostname Service</code> when you run the <code>nv config apply</code> command after setting the hostname with <code>nv set system hostname</code>. To work around this issue, run the <code>nv config apply</code> command a second time. | 5.3.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3226506"></a> [3226506](#3226506) <a name="3226506"></a> <br /> | The <code>l1-show eth0</code> command does not show port information and is not supported in this release.  | 5.3.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3172504"></a> [3172504](#3172504) <a name="3172504"></a> <br /> | When you connect the NVIDIA SN4600C switch to a Spectrum 1 or Spectrum-3 switch with a 40GbE passive copper cable (Part Number: MC2210126-005) on edge ports 1-4 and 61-64, there is an Effective BER of 1E-12 in PHY. | 5.2.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3147782"></a> [3147782](#3147782) <a name="3147782"></a> <br /> | You cannot use NVUE to configure an SNMP view to include a subtree beginning with a period. For example:<pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set service snmp-server viewname cumulusOnly included .1.3.6.1.4.1.40310Error: GET /nvue_v1/service/snmp-server/viewname/cumulusOnly/included?pointers=%5B%22%2Fparameters%22%2C+%22%2Fpatch%2FrequestBody%2Fcontent%2Fapplication~1json%2Fschema%22%2C+%22%2Fpatch%2Fparameters%22%2C+%22%2Fpatch%2Fresponses%2F200%2Flinks%22%5D responded with 404 NOT FOUND</pre>To work around this issue, reference the OID without the preceding period ( <code>.</code> ) in the command. | 5.3.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3145869"></a> [3145869](#3145869) <a name="3145869"></a> <br /> | On a Spectrum-3 switch, the PTP offset in 10GbE changes between +-27. The average offset is around 7. | 5.2.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3135952"></a> [3135952](#3135952) <a name="3135952"></a> <br /> | PAM4 split cables (such as 2x100G, 4x100G, and 4x50G) do not work with a forced speed setting (when auto-negotiation is off) as the default speed enabled is for NRZ mode (such as 100G_4X). To work around this issue,  set the appropriate lanes for forced speed (with auto-negotation off) with the <code>ethtool -s swpX speed <port_speed> autoneg off lanes <no_of_lanes></code> command. For example: <pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo ethtool -s swp1 speed 100000 autoneg off lanes 2</pre> | 5.2.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3122301"></a> [3122301](#3122301) <a name="3122301"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN4700 switch, inserting and removing the PSU might cause loss of frames. | 5.2.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3115242"></a> [3115242](#3115242) <a name="3115242"></a> <br /> | When you configure two VNIs in the same VLAN, ifupdown2  shows a <code>vlan added to two or more VXLANS</code> warning, which is only issued after the VNI is already added to the bridge. This leaves the new VNI in the PVID even if there is already an existing VNI configured in that PVID. | 5.1.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3103821"></a> [3103821](#3103821) <a name="3103821"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN4700 switch, inserting and removing the PSU might cause loss of frames. | 5.2.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3084476"></a> [3084476](#3084476) <a name="3084476"></a> <br /> | The default QOS traffic shaping configuration does not restore after you disable traffic shaping in the <code>/etc/cumulus/datapath/qos/qos_features.conf</code> file. To work around this issue, restart <code>switchd</code>. | 4.4.3, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | 4.4.4-4.4.5|
| <a name="3084027"></a> [3084027](#3084027) <a name="3084027"></a> <br /> | Under a high load, you might see ingress drop counters increase. The drops are classified as <code>HwIfInDiscards</code> in ethtool and shown as <code>ingress_general</code> in hardware. | 4.3.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3071652"></a> [3071652](#3071652) <a name="3071652"></a> <br /> | On rare occasions, after you reboot or restart <code>switchd</code> on a Spectrum 1 switch, any 25G connections with Direct Attach Copper (DAC) cables that connect from the switch to a non-NVIDIA device might flap continuously. To work around this issue, bring the affected link administratively down for a few seconds on the non-NVIDIA device, then bring the link back up. | 4.4.4-4.4.5, 5.1.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3061656"></a> [3061656](#3061656) <a name="3061656"></a> <br /> | When the CPU load is high during a warm boot, bonds with a slow LACP rate fail to forward layer 2 traffic for up to 60 seconds (depending on the duration of the CPU load) and static bonds fail to forward layer 2 traffic for up to 5 seconds. | 5.1.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="3053094"></a> [3053094](#3053094) <a name="3053094"></a> <br /> | When the CPU load is high during a warm boot, bonds with a slow LACP rate fail to forward layer 2 traffic for up to 60 seconds (depending on the duration of the CPU load) and static bonds fail to forward layer 2 traffic for up to 5 seconds. | 5.1.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2972540"></a> [2972540](#2972540) <a name="2972540"></a> <br /> | With RADIUS enabled for user shell authentication, there might be a delay in local user authentication for non cumulus user accounts. | 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2964279"></a> [2964279](#2964279) <a name="2964279"></a> <br /> | When a VNI flaps, an incorrect list of layer 2 VNIs are associated with a layer 3 VNI. The NCLU <code>net show evpn vni detail</code> command output shows duplicate layer 2 VNIs under a layer 3 VNI.  | 3.7.15, 4.4.2-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | 3.7.16|
| <a name="2951110"></a> [2951110](#2951110) <a name="2951110"></a> <br /> | The <code>net show time ntp servers</code> command does not show any output with the management VRF. | 3.7.15-3.7.16, 4.1.1-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2904450"></a> [2904450](#2904450) <a name="2904450"></a> <br /> | When you run the <code>ethtool -m</code> or the <code>l1-show</code> command, the 400G interface optical values do not show.  | 4.4.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2891255"></a> [2891255](#2891255) <a name="2891255"></a> <br /> | CVE-2021-39925: Buffer overflow in the Bluetooth SDP dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.17 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file.<br>Vulnerable: <= 2.6.20-0+deb10u1<br>Fixed: 2.6.20-0+deb10u2 | 4.0.0-4.4.1, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | 4.4.2-4.4.5|
| <a name="2890681"></a> [2890681](#2890681) <a name="2890681"></a> <br /> | CVE-2021-42771: relative path traversal in Babel, a set of tools for internationalising Python applications, could result in the execution of arbitrary code<br />Vulnerable: 2.6.0+dfsg.1-1Fixed: 2.6.0+dfsg.1-1+deb10u1 | 4.0.0-4.4.1, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | 4.4.2-4.4.5|
| <a name="2867042"></a> [2867042](#2867042) <a name="2867042"></a> <br /> | When connecting the NVIDIA SN4600 switch to another NVIDIA Spectrum switch, you must use auto-negotiation mode (not force mode); otherwise the switch might use the wrong Tx configuration. | 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2847755"></a> [2847755](#2847755) <a name="2847755"></a> <br /> | When you use NCLU to remove the configuration for a peer that is a member of a group but also has other peer-specific configuration, you must remove the peer-specific configuration before you delete the peer in a separate NCLU commit. | 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2823307"></a> [2823307](#2823307) <a name="2823307"></a> <br /> | Cumuls Linux does not support a bond with more than 64 ports.  Any configuration with more than 64 ports in a bond changes all ports to down when you apply the configuration.  | 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2736108"></a> [2736108](#2736108) <a name="2736108"></a> <br /> | When you change the VRRP advertisement interval on the master, the <code>master advertisement interval</code> field in the <code>show vrrp</code> command output does not show the updated value. | 4.4.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2705056"></a> [2705056](#2705056) <a name="2705056"></a> <br /> | SVIs do not inherit the pinned MAC address of the bridge. | 4.3.0, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | 4.3.1-4.4.5|
| <a name="2701000"></a> [2701000](#2701000) <a name="2701000"></a> <br /> | A default route learned from DHCP on eth0 in the management VRF might install in the default VRF if eth0 is disconnected and the original next hop is reachable in the default VRF. To work around this issue, delete the DHCP lease file for eth0 with the <code>sudo rm /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.eth0.leases</code> command. | 4.3.0, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | 4.3.1-4.4.5|
| <a name="2684925"></a> [2684925](#2684925) <a name="2684925"></a> <br /> | The NVUE <code>nv show vrf default router bgp peer</code> command produces a 404 not found error. | 4.4.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.8.0 | |
| <a name="2671652"></a> [2671652](#2671652) <a name="2671652"></a> <br /> | In VXLAN routing environments, you might experience sub-optimal route convergence delays (greater than five seconds) when a prefix transitions to a new ECMP next-hop group. This condition might occur when a VTEP loses ECMP routes through all uplink peerings, then installs the routes through a different path, such as an MLAG peerlink. | 4.4.0-4.4.5, 5.5.0-5.8.0 | |

### Fixed Issues in 5.8.0
|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|
|---	        |---	        |---	    |
| <a name="3713420"></a> [3713420](#3713420) <a name="3713420"></a> <br /> | When you run the <code>systemctl restart switchd.service</code> command or reboot the switch after you set the host route preference option with the NVUE <code>nv set system forwarding host-route-preference</code> command or manually in the <code>/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf</code> file, <code>switchd</code> crashes and creates core files. | 5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3712007"></a> [3712007](#3712007) <a name="3712007"></a> <br /> | In RSTP mode when there is a bridge port flap, Cumulus Linux flushes, then re-adds dynamic MAC addresses on the peerlink, which might cause short traffic disruption. | 5.6.0-5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3711830"></a> [3711830](#3711830) <a name="3711830"></a> <br /> | NVUE does not let you configure IPv4 ACL rules with the SNAT action on egress layer 3 bond interfaces. To work around this issue, configure the rules in a separate <code>.rules</code> file in <code>/etc/cumulus/acl/policy,d/</code> directory. |  | |
| <a name="3710396"></a> [3710396](#3710396) <a name="3710396"></a> <br /> | In an eBGP multihop configuration with dynamic neighbors, Cumulus Linux does not update the configured TTL but uses the MAXTTL instead. This issue is only observed with dynamic peers. | 5.6.0-5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3698680"></a> [3698680](#3698680) <a name="3698680"></a> <br /> | If you run the <code>ifreload -a</code> command when ACLs exist but non_atomic update mode is set in the <code>switchd.conf</code> file, traffic pauses on unaffected interfaces. | 5.6.0-5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3695491"></a> [3695491](#3695491) <a name="3695491"></a> <br /> | When you log into a Cumulus Linux switch after a fresh install through the serial console, the management VRF might not be available. (This is not an issue with ssh.) To work around this issue, log out, then log back into the console a few seconds later after the switch finishes booting. | 5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3632843"></a> [3632843](#3632843) <a name="3632843"></a> <br /> | When the switch receives a type5 route in BGP and there is a network statement for the same prefix, BGP sometimes removes the request to track next hops from FRR. As next hop reachability changes, BGP no longer reacts to the change. To work around this issue, run the <code>clear bgp *</code> command for all peerings. | 5.6.0-5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3630492"></a> [3630492](#3630492) <a name="3630492"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA SN2201 switch, the <code>ledmgrd -d</code> command output shows the system and PSU LED status as orange when the physical LED is green. | 5.5.1-5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3614286"></a> [3614286](#3614286) <a name="3614286"></a> <br /> | To avoid unnecessary traffic loss, <code>ifreload</code> (ifupdown2) only flaps a bond to reset its MAC address when the bond MAC address is not present on any of the bond's interfaces. Previously, ifupdown2 enforced the bond MAC address to be set to the MAC address of the first interface.  | 5.6.0-5.7.0 | |
| <a name="3334275"></a> [3334275](#3334275) <a name="3334275"></a> <br /> | When you run the <code>sensors</code> command, the output shows an erroneous fault on some front panel ports. | 5.2.0-5.7.0 | |
