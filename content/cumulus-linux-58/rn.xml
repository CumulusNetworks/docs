<td>The NVUE {{nv show system config snippet}} command does not show any data. This occurs because traditional and flexible snippets represent free-form text and are not suitable to be configured or retrieved with the NVUE CLI. To work around this issue, run the {{nv show system config snippet -o json}} or {{nv show system config snippet -o yaml}} command. You can also a run a {{GET /nvue_v1/system/config/snippet }} REST API method.</td>

<td>When an unresolved next hop is present in a next hop group, especially over an SVI interface, the switch checks if the neighbor MAC address is in the forwarding table. If the neighbor's MAC address not there, the switch skips this next hop from backend programming and you see the {{switchd}} error {{ERR NH: l3 nhg v6 l3 nhg contains one or more unresolvable nexthops}}. There is no impact to switch functionality as unresolved neighbors are not programmed in hardware until they are resolved.</td>

This issue can lead to a feedback loop between the {{clagd}} service and {{switchd}}, and might result in critical CPU usage with an out of memory condition.
