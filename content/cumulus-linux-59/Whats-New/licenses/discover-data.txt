Package: discover-data
Debian package author: Branden Robinson

The contents of this package that are not in the debian/ subdirectory are
simple compilations of data and are therefore not copyrightable in the
United States (c.f. _Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service
Company, Inc., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)_).

_Feist_ holds that:

Article I, s 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution mandates originality as a
prerequisite for copyright protection. The constitutional requirement
necessitates independent creation plus a modicum of creativity. Since facts
do not owe their origin to an act of authorship, they are not original and,
thus, are not copyrightable. Although a compilation of facts may possess
the requisite originality because the author typically chooses which facts
to include, in what order to place them, and how to arrange the data so
that readers may use them effectively, copyright protection extends only to
those components of the work that are original to the author, not to the
facts themselves. This fact/expression dichotomy severely limits the scope
of protection in fact-based works.

Therefore, the hardware information lists that comprise the "meat" of this
package enjoy no copyright protection and are thus in the public domain.

Note, however, that a number of trademarks may be referenced in the hardware
lists (names of vendors and products).  Their usage does not imply a challenge
to any such status, and all trademarks, service marks, etc. are the property of
their respective owners.
