Comment: This is the Debian prepackaged version of flex, the fast lexical
         analyzer generator. This package was first put together by
         Robert Leslie <rob@mars.org>. It is currently maintained by
         Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>, who took over from
         Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>, and it is built from
         sources obtained from: https://github.com/westes/flex
