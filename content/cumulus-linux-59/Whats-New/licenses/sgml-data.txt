You are right with respect to our general approach. I suspect that as long
as the DOCTYPE is different from our own, and they attribute it as a work
derived from W3C, we'd give permission. Let me bounce this off a few folks
here, and I'll get you a definitive answer shortly.

  This working draft may be updated, replaced or rendered obsolete by other W3C
