## 5.9.4 Release Notes
### Open Issues in 5.9.4

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="4582679"></a> [4582679](#4582679) <a name="4582679"></a> <br /> | If a node has Suppress Route Advertisement enabled and routes are re-learned; for example, when a peer sends the route again due to route policy changes, or you enable or disable graceful shutdown, not all routes are offloaded, which might cause discrepancies in traffic.  | 5.9.4-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4531104"></a> [4531104](#4531104) <a name="4531104"></a> <br /> | On a switch with SDK 4.6.1062 or earlier, you might see FW fatal health events. | 5.6.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4521203"></a> [4521203](#4521203) <a name="4521203"></a> <br /> | The SATA driver on the NVIDIA SN2410 switch sometimes exhibits failures similar to the following:<br><pre>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785966+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: <br>&#91;49878794.456350&#93; ata1.00: failed command: WRITE FPDMA QUEUED<br>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785968+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: &#91;49878794.461984&#93; ata1.00: cmd<br>61/08:08:50:2b:c4/00:00:01:00:00/40 tag 1 ncq dma 4096 out<br>2025-06-20T20:03:38.785970+09:00 S1-RF10B kernel: &#91;49878794.461984&#93; res 40/00:0c:50:2b:c4/00:00:01:00:00/40 Emask 0×10 (ATA bus error)</pre><br>To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. | 5.5.1-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4495231"></a> [4495231](#4495231) <a name="4495231"></a> <br /> | If the hardware clock date is later than 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, the image might fail to install due to a grub-install failure on the EFI filesystem, which is a VFAT filesystem.  As a result, you see the grub prompt immediately after reboot.  To work around this issue, reboot from the grub prompt to go into ONIE.  From ONIE, use the date command to set a date before 2038-01-19, then run the <code>hwclock --systohc</code> command to add it to the hardware clock.  You can then use <code>onie-nos-install</code> to install the image. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423336"></a> [4423336](#4423336) <a name="4423336"></a> <br /> | When you configure TACACS with NVUE or merge an NVUE configuration file that includes TACACS configuration with the <code>nv config patch</code> command, you see an unrecoverable error when running additional NVUE commands. To work around this issue, restart the NVUE service with <code>systemctl restart nvued.service</code>. | 5.9.0-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4423335"></a> [4423335](#4423335) <a name="4423335"></a> <br /> | When you configure TACACS with NVUE or merge an NVUE configuration file that includes TACACS configuration with the <code>nv config patch</code> command, you see an unrecoverable error when running additional NVUE commands. To work around this issue, restart the NVUE service with <code>systemctl restart nvued.service</code>. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423248"></a> [4423248](#4423248) <a name="4423248"></a> <br /> | If you unset an interface static IP address when the interface IP gateway is configured, the <code>nv config apply</code> command fails with an <code>ifreload.service</code> error. To work around this issue, unset both the static IP address and gateway together. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4423244"></a> [4423244](#4423244) <a name="4423244"></a> <br /> | When you enable, then disable adaptive routing, the BGP neighbors might go down because of an unresolved MAC address. To work around this issue, configure another attribute on the interface. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4422898"></a> [4422898](#4422898) <a name="4422898"></a> <br /> | When displaying BGP neighbor advertised routes in JSON format with very large routing tables, the process consumes excessive memory resulting in out of memory crashes.  | 5.0.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="4281099"></a> [4281099](#4281099) <a name="4281099"></a> <br /> | When you bring STP down, then up on the primary MLAG peer, the STP state machine restarts and the peerlink operational edge resets. As a result, the secondary MLAG peer ends up in an STP discarding state. To work around this issue, restart the <code>clagd</code> service. | 5.8.0-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4223451"></a> [4223451](#4223451) <a name="4223451"></a> <br /> | When you change the VRR MAC address, <code>switchd</code> crashes. This occurs because deleting an old VRR MAC address triggers a neighbor update that changes the ECMP container resolution, which results in route entry updates<br />This happens in async mode, where the end notification expected after an end of operation is missing. | 5.9.2-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4195240"></a> [4195240](#4195240) <a name="4195240"></a> <br /> | Cumulus Linux installs and runs the <code>atftpd</code> program by default but cannot access it because a <code>/tftpboot</code> directory is missing. | 5.9.2-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4129699"></a> [4129699](#4129699) <a name="4129699"></a> <br /> | <code>switchd</code> crashes because the hardware MAC limit is higher than the maximum. | 5.8.0-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4127253"></a> [4127253](#4127253) <a name="4127253"></a> <br /> | You might see <code>switchd</code> high-memory consumption and eventually <code>switchd</code> stops because it is out of memory due to higher tunnel (VNI x VTEP) scale. | 5.8.0-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4124831"></a> [4124831](#4124831) <a name="4124831"></a> <br /> | When you enable Per-VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree (PVRST) mode, bonds with LACP bypass discard ingress DHCP packets. | 5.9.1-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4124139"></a> [4124139](#4124139) <a name="4124139"></a> <br /> | When you add MLAG configuration to the first bond in a single MLAG switch configuration, MLAG interfaces and VXLAN interfaces go down. | 5.8.0-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4101808"></a> [4101808](#4101808) <a name="4101808"></a> <br /> | When the SNMP service is busy for approximately more than a minute, the applications using <code>net-snmp</code> APIs to support their MIBs (such as FRR) become blocked.  | 5.9.0-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4075960"></a> [4075960](#4075960) <a name="4075960"></a> <br /> | When you configure the IGMP Querier on a VLAN, the switch sends IGMP Querier packets on the untagged VLAN, not the configured VLAN. Also, the source IP address is always 0.0.0.0, even though the loopback IP address is configured on the IGMP Querier.  | 5.9.1-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4062001"></a> [4062001](#4062001) <a name="4062001"></a> <br /> | With VM migration from one VTEP to another, traffic loss might occur during a MAC move as locally learned MAC addresses are frequently refreshed in the kernel.  | 5.8.0-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4052578"></a> [4052578](#4052578) <a name="4052578"></a> <br /> | When you perform a binary upgrade from Cumulus Linux 5.8 or earlier to 5.9.0 or later with a pre-staged <code>startup.yaml</code> file, the cumulus user password is reset to the default password because there is no default <code>startup.yaml</code> file present in 5.8.0 or earlier. To work around this issue, generate the <code>startup.yaml</code> file from the existing NVUE configuration.  | 5.9.2-5.11.3 | 5.12.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4049213"></a> [4049213](#4049213) <a name="4049213"></a> <br /> | When there are routes that point to a single next hop, an ECMP entry is created in the SDK. After the single next hop from the route is removed, the ECMP entry might stay in the SDK until the time the next hop is present in the kernel. | 5.9.2-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="4042657"></a> [4042657](#4042657) <a name="4042657"></a> <br /> | The SDK times out with a FW FATAL health event, which requires a reboot of the system to recover.  | 5.9.1-5.10.0 | 5.10.1-5.14.0|
| <a name="4040024"></a> [4040024](#4040024) <a name="4040024"></a> <br /> | After network churn, the <code>﻿watchfrr</code> process might restart FRR because zebra is unresponsive. | 5.9.1-5.10.0 | 5.10.1-5.14.0|
| <a name="4039850"></a> [4039850](#4039850) <a name="4039850"></a> <br /> | When the MAC address of the neighbor changes, a possible crash might occur because the pointer to which the MAC address points is freed, resulting in a dangling pointer. | 5.3.1-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="4019257"></a> [4019257](#4019257) <a name="4019257"></a> <br /> | Some switches start booting but stop at the boot menu because console‑port noise is misinterpreted as input. | 5.9.1-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3994544"></a> [3994544](#3994544) <a name="3994544"></a> <br /> | Under certain scale scenarios, the switch might end up in a state where the PTM component's connection to LLDP breaks. This issue results in LLDP socket contention issues and, in turn, a PTM memory leak. | 5.9.1-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3985600"></a> [3985600](#3985600) <a name="3985600"></a> <br /> | NTP initialization issues prevent the NTP service from starting on a non-default VRF. | 5.9.0-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3915878"></a> [3915878](#3915878) <a name="3915878"></a> <br /> | If you configure remote syslog export through a non-default VRF, you might see repeated error logs from the <code>rsyslog</code> process while the switch is booting:<br><pre>rsyslogd: create UDP socket bound to device failed: No such device &#91;v8.2302.0&#93;rsyslogd: No UDP socket could successfully be initialized, some functionality may be disabled.  &#91;v8.2302.0&#93;</pre><br>The logs occur because the <code>rsyslog</code> service starts before the networking service creates the configured VRF for syslog export. There is no functional impact with this issue. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3900813"></a> [3900813](#3900813) <a name="3900813"></a> <br /> | When you configure or edit a large or extended BGP community list with NVUE, <code>nv config apply</code> might return an error and <code>frr-reload</code> might fail with the following message in <code>/var/log/frr/frr-reload.log</code>:<br><pre>2025-04-04 18:15:44,745 WARNING: frr-reload.py failed due to vtysh (exec file) exited with status 13</pre><br>You can safely ignore this error as FRR accepts and applies the new configuration. To work around this issue, apply the same configuration with the <code>nv config apply -y</code> command. The new configuration will correctly show in both NVUE and FRR. | 5.9.0-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3897227"></a> [3897227](#3897227) <a name="3897227"></a> <br /> | During an LLDP update storm while deleting or adding LLPD neighbors, PTMD crashes as a result of mishandling multi-threaded LLPD processing. | 5.5.1-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3895848"></a> [3895848](#3895848) <a name="3895848"></a> <br /> | MLAG bonds might report an LACP partner MAC mismatch unexpectedly during LACP negotation and MLAG convergence until the bond reaches a dual connected state. There is no impact to bonds when this mismatch is reported. | 5.9.0-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3890993"></a> [3890993](#3890993) <a name="3890993"></a> <br /> | On the NVIDIA spectrum-4 switch, <code>l1-show</code> command output does not show Eye opening information for an interface port. | 5.9.0-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3879809"></a> [3879809](#3879809) <a name="3879809"></a> <br /> | What Just Happened (WJH) now works on Spectrum-4 switches. | 5.9.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="3878699"></a> [3878699](#3878699) <a name="3878699"></a> <br /> | In an EVPN multihoming configuration, when the VXLAN device associated with a layer 2 VNI flaps, there is a route entry in the tenant VRF associated with the locally learned host.   | 5.9.0-5.10.1 | 5.11.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3878394"></a> [3878394](#3878394) <a name="3878394"></a> <br /> | When ZTP runs a script that contains <code>wget</code>, ZTP fails and you see a message similar to the following:<br><pre>ZTP: ZTP DHCP: Unexpected error: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 181: ordinal not in range(128)ZTP: Script returned failure </pre><br>To work around this issue, use the <code>-q</code> option with <code>wget</code>. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3877516"></a> [3877516](#3877516) <a name="3877516"></a> <br /> | When you connect two NVIDIA switches and configure 400G speed in force mode, links don't come up.<br>To work around this issue, make sure auto-negotiation is always on when connecting NVIDIA to NVIDIA in PAM4. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3875687"></a> [3875687](#3875687) <a name="3875687"></a> <br /> | After changing the VXLAN local tunnel IP address, the new IP address is not reflected in the <code>Local Vtep Ip</code> field of the <code>nv show evpn vni <vni></code> command output.  To work around this issue, either run the <code>ifup <vxlan-id></code> command or reboot the switch. | 5.9.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
| <a name="3875373"></a> [3875373](#3875373) <a name="3875373"></a> <br /> | When you run the <code>nv config apply empty</code> command, NVUE removes the <code>cumulus user</code>. If you are logged in as the <code>cumulus</code> user when you run the <code>nv config apply empty</code> command, the command fails. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3873219"></a> [3873219](#3873219) <a name="3873219"></a> <br /> | When you remove a port from a bond and add it to the bridge in a single set of NVUE commands, then apply the configuration, the port forwarding state is blocked on all the bridge VLANs. To work around this issue, apply the configuration in two steps. First remove the port from the bond and apply the configuration, then add the port to the bridge and apply the configuration.  | 5.9.0-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3861745"></a> [3861745](#3861745) <a name="3861745"></a> <br /> | On UEFI hardware (where the <code>/sys/firmware/efi</code> directory exists), using the update-grub program might generate a <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> that is incorrect for booting ONIE if the ONIE option is selected on the console while booting. To work around this issue, run <code>mount LABEL="EFI System" /boot/efi</code> before using update-grub. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3855796"></a> [3855796](#3855796) <a name="3855796"></a> <br /> | When configuring a Unicast Master Table for clients, the server addresses must be reachable and the route to the destination must exist. The unicast table can have one directly-connected port for a client. This restriction is only for directly connected ports and doesn't apply to Unicast Servers on other devices or switches. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3847439"></a> [3847439](#3847439) <a name="3847439"></a> <br /> | In rare cases on the Spectrum 1 switch, where a dual connected host transmits all traffic flows to only one switch in a connected MLAG pair, and the host changes behavior to hash all flows to the other MLAG switch, there might be traffic loss if the MAC FDB entry on the original switch ages out. | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3819945"></a> [3819945](#3819945) <a name="3819945"></a> <br /> | When you connect an NVIDIA SN4410, SN4700, or SN5600 switch to any Spectrum 1, Spectrum-2, or Spectrum-3 peer switch (with four lanes) using a 4x breakout configuration and the default lanes per port setting, links do not come up. To work around this issue, provide the lanes per port configuration shown below:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set interface <interface> link breakout 4x lanes-per-port 1</pre> | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3818545"></a> [3818545](#3818545) <a name="3818545"></a> <br /> | The terminal monitoring software SecureCRT has a known issue when running on both Windows and Mac systems where it gets stuck when monitoring the serial port of the switch as Cumulus Linux boots up.  When this occurs, the serial port stops as shown below and SecureCRT is unable to receive any more serial data from the switch (it is able to transmit).<br><pre>Mounting dev-hugepages.mount - Huge Pages File System..<br />Mounting dev-mqueue.mount</pre> | 5.9.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3775686"></a> [3775686](#3775686) <a name="3775686"></a> <br /> | The BGP Suppress Route Advertisement feature under scale (more than 30000 routes) advertises partial updates to downstream neighbors. Because FRR does not read kernel route updates fast enough, the netlink socket receive buffer gets full and further update notifications are dropped. | 5.8.0-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3774274"></a> [3774274](#3774274) <a name="3774274"></a> <br /> | When you manually configure the <code>/etc/cumulus/datapath/qos/qos_features.conf</code> file without applying the QoS configuration with NVUE, running the <code>nv config apply empty</code> command later does not clean up the QoS configuration. If the QoS configuration includes breakout ports, the <code>nv config apply empty</code> command fails due to a <code>switchd</code> reload trigger failure. To work around this issue, clean up the configuration manually in the <code>/etc/cumulus/datapath/qos/qos_features.conf</code>, then run the <code>nv config apply empty</code> command. | 5.8.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3773177"></a> [3773177](#3773177) <a name="3773177"></a> <br /> | When you try to upgrade a switch from Cumulus Linux with package upgrade, you might see errors for expired GPG keys that prevent you from upgrading. To work around this issue, install the new keys with the following commands, then upgrade the switch.<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ wget https://download.nvidia.com/cumulus/apt.cumulusnetworks.com/repo/pool/cumulus/c/cumulus-archive-keyring/cumulus-archive-keyring_4-cl5.6.0u5_all.deb<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo apt install ./cumulus-archive-keyring_4-cl5.6.0u5_all.deb<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo apt update<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ sudo apt upgrade</pre> | 4.0.0-4.4.5, 5.0.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3771168"></a> [3771168](#3771168) <a name="3771168"></a> <br /> | When you perform an ISSU upgrade on a Spectrum 1 switch, the <code>switchd</code> service might crash. | 5.8.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3711913"></a> [3711913](#3711913) <a name="3711913"></a> <br /> | When you set an IPv4 ACL with a log action, logs do not appear under syslog after a match. This issue affects bridged packets when the rule is installed in iptables. To work around this issue, set the ACL with a MAC rule type so that it is installed in ebtables and the packets are logged correctly in <code>syslog</code>.<br>The following shows an example configuration:<br><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set acl one rule 1 action log log-prefix NVIDIA<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set acl one rule 1 match ip protocol udp<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set acl one rule 1 match ip source-ip 10.0.14.2<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set acl one rule 1 match ip udp source-port 34<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set acl one rule 1 match mac protocol ipv4<br>cumulus&#64;switch:~$ nv set acl one type mac</pre> | 5.7.0-5.9.4 | 5.10.0-5.14.0|
| <a name="3677533"></a> [3677533](#3677533) <a name="3677533"></a> <br /> | Due to resource constraints on the Spectrum 1 switch, <code>staticd</code> performance drops and  takes longer to read static routes compared to the time BGP takes to complete a graceful restart and advertise routes and EOR to its helpers. As a result, static routes are advertised after the EOR is sent to graceful restart helpers, which delete the stale static routes and relearn them after receiving the EOR from the restarting node. Temporary traffic loss might occur. | 5.7.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3655681"></a> [3655681](#3655681) <a name="3655681"></a> <br /> | When you disable, then enable STP auto-edge on a port, the port might not transition to the operational edge even though the port does not receive bpdus. To work around this issue, configure the port as an admin-edge port. | 5.7.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3637444"></a> [3637444](#3637444) <a name="3637444"></a> <br /> | Applying an inbound control plane ACL on the eth0 management interface does not take effect. To work around this issue, apply the ACL on the <code>mgmt</code> interface; for example, <code>nv set interface mgmt acl <acl-id> inbound control-plane</code>. | 5.7.0-5.14.0 | |
| <a name="3636266"></a> [3636266](#3636266) <a name="3636266"></a> <br /> | When an unresolved next hop is present in a next hop group, especially over an SVI interface, the switch checks if the neighbor MAC address is in the forwarding table. If the neighbor's MAC address is not there, the switch skips this next hop from backend programming and you see the <code>switchd</code> error <code>ERR NH: l3 nhg v6 l3 nhg contains one or more unresolvable nexthops</code>.

For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, and so on.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.9.1-5.9.3, 5.14.0 | 5.9.4|

| <a name="4548514"></a> [4548514](#4548514) <a name="4548514"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, and so on.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.9.1-5.9.3, 5.14.0 | 5.9.4|

| <a name="4546684"></a> [4546684](#4546684) <a name="4546684"></a> <br /> | When an SVI interface is brought up with routes installed against it, during subsequent interface updates that are applied to the interface during bringup such as MTU changes, interface forwarding state, MAC learning updates, or multicast forwarding state changes, the routes installed for the interface might be programmed as blackhole routes. This can occur during a fresh boot of a switch. To work around this issue, toggle the interface state of the SVI.  | 5.8.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|

To work around this issue, convert the data shown in bytes to packets by multiplying by 1024 if the data is in KB, 1024x1024 if the data is in MB, and 1024x1024x1024 if the data is in GB. | 5.9.2-5.9.3 | 5.9.4-5.14.0|

| <a name="4548514"></a> [4548514](#4548514) <a name="4548514"></a> <br /> | When a connected route for an SVI interface with VRR configured is installed by FRR, the route might be installed with the next hop interface of the VRR device instead of the SVI. For example, instead of interface <code>vlan10</code>, the route might install against <code>vlan10-v0</code>. This prevents next-hop tracking and route installation into hardware.<br>This issue can occur in the following conditions:<br><ul><li>When initially configuring VRF route leaking, the target VRF might not install a route into hardware when leaking directly connected routes for SVI interfaces with VRR enabled.</li><li>In an MLAG and VRR configuration, static routes fail to install when the route is resolved through a connected route and the interface of the connected route undergoes a link state change for any reason, such as link flaps, interface bring-up, <code>clagd</code> restart, <code>switchd</code> restart, and so on.</li></ul><br>To work around this issue, restart the FRR service using the <code>sudo systemctl restart frr.service</code> command.  | 5.9.1-5.9.3, 5.14.0 | 5.9.4|
| <a name="4548340"></a> [4548340](#4548340) <a name="4548340"></a> <br /> | When a host moves to a new VTEP during mobility or network failover events in an EVPN multihoming environment, the host might be unreachable due to ARP resolution failures.

| <a name="4546684"></a> [4546684](#4546684) <a name="4546684"></a> <br /> | When an SVI interface is brought up with routes installed against it, during subsequent interface updates that are applied to the interface during bringup such as MTU changes, interface forwarding state, MAC learning updates, or multicast forwarding state changes, the routes installed for the interface might be programmed as blackhole routes. This can occur during a fresh boot of a switch. To work around this issue, toggle the interface state of the SVI.  | 5.8.0-5.13.1 | 5.14.0|
