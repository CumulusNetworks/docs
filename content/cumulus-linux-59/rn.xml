<td>Due to resource constraints on the Spectrum 1 switch, {{staticd}} performance drops and  takes longer to read static routes compared to the time BGP takes to complete a graceful restart, and advertise routes and EOR to its helpers. As a result, static routes are advertised after the EOR is sent to graceful restart helpers, which delete the stale static routes and relearn them after receiving the EOR from the restarting node. Temporary traffic loss might occur.</td>

<td>If you use the NVIDIA SN5600 (Spectrum-4) switch with Ixia test equipment, you might experience delayed link up due to intermittent link flaps. 
To work around this issue when using copper cables:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Ixia IxOS version 9.37 with HF002156, or version 9.39 or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the DAC cable on ports 10 through 50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use NVIDIA cables with the recommended firmware revision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure AN on the Cumulus Linux switch and AN/LT on Ixia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
To work around this issue when using fiber cables:
