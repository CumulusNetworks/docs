This is due to both the ASIC Monitoring service and the What Just Happened (WJH) service trying to initialize the SDK TELE module. You can ignore the messages because the TELE service has already initialized properly.</td>

This most often occurs at scale when many VRFs have similar names. To work around this issue, manually specify a unique VLAN for each VRF.</td>

<td>When you use a single VXLAN device (SVD) with MLAG and static VXLAN tunnels, Cumulus Linux incorrectly associates the MAC addresses it learns from the VXLAN fabric to the bridge PVID.
