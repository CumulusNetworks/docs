You use the Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) to manage additional applications (in the form of packages) and to install the latest updates.

{{%notice warning%}}

Updating, upgrading, and installing packages with `apt` causes disruptions to network services:

- Upgrading a package might result in services being restarted or stopped as part of the upgrade process.
- Installing a package might disrupt core services by changing core service dependency packages. In some cases, installing new packages might also upgrade additional existing packages due to dependencies.

If services are stopped, you might need to reboot the switch for those services to restart.

## Update the Package Cache

To work properly, `apt` relies on a local cache listing of the available packages. You must populate the cache initially, then periodically update it with `sudo -E apt-get update`:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update

{{%notice tip%}}

Cumulus Networks recommends you use the `-E` option with `sudo` whenever you run any `apt-get` command. This option preserves your environment variables (such as HTTP proxies) before you install new packages or upgrade your distribution.

## List Available Packages

After the cache is populated, use the `apt-cache` command to search the cache and find the packages in which you are interested or to get information about an available package. Here are examples of the `search` and `show` sub-commands:

{{%notice note%}}

The search commands look for the search terms not only in the package name but in other parts of the package information; the search matches on more packages than you might expect.

## List Packages Installed on the System

The the `apt-cache` command shows information about all the packages available in the repository. To see which packages are actually installed on your system with their versions, run the following commands.

<details>

<summary>NCLU Commands </summary>

Run the `net show package version` command:

```

## Show the Version of a Package

To show the version of a specific package installed on the system:

<details>

<summary>NCLU Commands </summary>

Run the `net show package version <package>` command. For example, the following command shows which version of the `vrf` package is installed on the system:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net show package version vrf
1.0-cl4u1
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Linux Commands </summary>

Run the Linux `dpkg -l <package_name>` command. For example, the following command shows which version of the `vrf` package is installed on the system:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ dpkg -l vrf
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold

## Upgrade Packages

{{%notice note%}}

You cannot upgrade to Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 by upgrading packages. You must install a disk image of the new release using ONIE. Refer to [Upgrading Cumulus Linux](../Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux/).

{{%/notice%}}

To upgrade all the packages installed on the system to their latest versions, run the following commands:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get upgrade
```

A list of packages that will be upgraded is displayed and you are prompted to continue.

The above commands upgrade all installed versions with their latest versions but do not install any new packages.

<!--CANNOT DO THIS IN 4.0.0  ## Add New Packages

To add a new package, first ensure the package is not already installed on the system:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ dpkg -l | grep <name of package>
```

- If the package is installed already, you can update the package from the Cumulus Linux repository as part of the package upgrade process, which upgrades all packages on the system. See [Upgrade Packages](#upgrade-packages) above.
- If the package is *not* already installed, add it by running `sudo -E apt-get install <name of package>`. This retrieves the package from the Cumulus Linux repository and installs it on your system together with any other packages on which this package might depend. The following example adds the `tcpreplay` package to the system:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install tcpreplay

cumulus@switch:~$
```

You can install several packages at the same time:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install <package 1> <package 2> <package 3>
```

{{%notice tip%}}

In some cases, installing a new package might also upgrade additional existing packages due to dependencies. To view these additional packages before you install, run the `apt-get install --dry-run` command.

{{%/notice%}}-->

## Add Packages from Another Repository

As shipped, Cumulus Linux searches the Cumulus Linux repository for available packages. You can add additional repositories to search by adding them to the list of sources that `apt-get` consults. See `man sources.list` for more information.

{{%notice tip%}}

Cumulus Networks has added features or made bug fixes to certain packages; you must not replace these packages with versions from other repositories. Cumulus Linux is configured to ensure that the packages from the Cumulus Linux repository are always preferred over packages from other repositories.

{{%/notice%}}

If you want to install packages that are not in the Cumulus Linux repository, the procedure is the same as above, but with one additional step.

{{%notice note%}}

Packages that are not part of the Cumulus Linux Repository are not typically tested and might not be supported by Cumulus Linux Technical Support.

{{%/notice%}}

Installing packages outside of the Cumulus Linux repository requires the use of `sudo -E apt-get`; however, depending on the package, you can use `easy-install` and other commands.

To install a new package, complete the following steps:

1. Run the `dpkg` command to ensure that the package is not already
    installed on the system:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ dpkg -l | grep {name of package}
```

2. If the package is installed already, ensure it is the version you need. If it is an older version, update the package from the Cumulus Linux repository:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install {name of package}
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get upgrade
```

3. If the package is not on the system, the package source location is most likely **not** in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file. If the source for the new package is **not** in `sources.list`, edit and add the appropriate source to the file. For example, add the following if you want a package from the Debian repository that is **not** in the Cumulus Linux repository:

```
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian buster main
deb http://security.debian.org/ buster/updates main
```

    Otherwise, the repository might be listed in `/etc/apt/sources.list` but is commented out, as can be the case with the early-access repository:

```
#deb http://apt.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-4-early-access cumulus
```

    To uncomment the repository, remove the \# at the start of the line, then save the file:

```
deb http://apt.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-4-early-access cumulus
```

4. Run `sudo -E apt-get update`, then install the package and upgrade:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install {name of package}
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get upgrade
```

## Add Packages from the Cumulus Linux Local Archive

Cumulus Linux contains a local archive embedded in the Cumulus Linux disk image. This archive contains the packages needed to install [`ifplugd`](../../Layer-1-and-Switch-Ports/Interface-Configuration-and-Management/ifplugd/), [LDAP](../../System-Configuration/Authentication-Authorization-and-Accounting/LDAP-Authentication-and-Authorization/), [RADIUS](../../System-Configuration/Authentication-Authorization-and-Accounting/RADIUS-AAA/) or [TACACS+](../../System-Configuration/Authentication-Authorization-and-Accounting/TACACS+/) without needing a network connection.

The archive is called `cumulus-local-apt-archive` and is referenced in the  `/etc/apt/cumulus-local-apt-archive-sources.list` file. It contains the following packages:

- audisp-tacplus
- ifplugd
- libdaemon0
- libnss-ldapd
- libnss-mapuser
- libnss-tacplus
- libpam-ldapd
- libpam-radius-auth
- libpam-tacplus
- libtac2
- libtacplus-map1
- nslcd

You add these packages normally with `apt-get update && apt-get install`, as [described above](#add-new-packages).
