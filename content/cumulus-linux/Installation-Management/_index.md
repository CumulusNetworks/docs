You can only install one image of the operating system on a Cumulus
Linux switch. This section discusses how to install new and update
existing Cumulus Linux disk images, and configure those images with
additional applications (using packages) if desired.

Zero touch provisioning provides a way to quickly deploy and configure
new switches in a large-scale environment.
