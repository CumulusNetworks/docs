Hardware datapath configuration manages packet buffering, queueing and
scheduling in hardware. There are two configuration input files:

  - `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`, which describes priority
    groups and assigns the scheduling algorithm and weights
  - `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cumulus/__chip_config/[bcm|mlx]/datapath.conf`, which assigns buffer space and egress queues

    {{%notice note%}}

While it's possible to change the buffer limits in the `datapath.conf` file, Cumulus Networks strongly recommends you [work with a Cumulus support engineer](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to do so.

    {{%/notice%}}

Each packet is assigned to an ASIC Class of Service (CoS) value based on
the packet's priority value stored in the 802.1p (Class of Service) or
DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) header field. The choice to
schedule packets based on COS or DSCP is a configurable option in the
`/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` file.

Priority groups include:

  - *Control*: Highest priority traffic
  - *Service*: Second-highest priority traffic
  - *Bulk*: All remaining traffic

The scheduler is configured to use a hybrid scheduling algorithm. It
applies strict priority to control traffic queues and a weighted round
robin selection from the remaining queues. Unicast packets and multicast
packets with the same priority value are assigned to separate queues,
which are assigned equal scheduling weights.

Datapath configuration takes effect when you initialize `switchd`.
Changes to the `traffic.conf` file require you to [restart the
`switchd`](../../System-Configuration/Configuring-switchd/#restart-switchd)
service.

{{%notice note%}}

You can configure Quality of Service (QoS) for switches on the following
platforms only:

  - Broadcom Tomahawk, Trident II, Trident II+ and Trident3
  - Mellanox Spectrum

{{%/notice%}}

## Commands

If you modify the configuration in the
`/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` file, you must [restart
`switchd`](../../System-Configuration/Configuring-switchd/#restart-switchd)
for the changes to take effect:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart switchd.service

## Example Configuration File

The following example `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` datapath
configuration file applies to 10G, 40G, and 100G switches on Broadcom
Tomahawk, Trident II, Trident II+, or Trident3 and Mellanox Spectrum
[platforms](http://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/) only. However, see the note
above for all the supported ASICs.

Keep in mind the following about the configuration:

  - Regarding the default source packet fields and mapping, each
    selected packet field should have a block of mapped values. Any
    packet field value that is not specified in the configuration is
    assigned to a default internal switch priority. The configuration
    applies to every forwarding port unless a custom remark
    configuration is defined for that port (see below).
  - Regarding the default remark packet fields and mapping, each
    selected packet field should have a block of mapped values. Any
    internal switch priority value that is not specified in the
    configuration is assigned to a default packet field value. The
    configuration applies to every forwarding port unless a custom
    remark configuration is defined for that port (see below).
  - Per-port source packet fields and mapping apply to the designated
    set of ports.
  - Per-port remark packet fields and mapping apply to the designated
    set of ports.

{{%notice note%}}

On Spectrum switches, packet priority remark must be enabled on
the **ingress** port. A packet received on a remark-enabled port is
remarked according to the priority mapping configured on the **egress**
port. If packet priority remark is configured the same way on every
port, the default configuration example above is correct. However,
per-port customized configurations require two port groups: one for the
ingress ports and one for the egress ports, as below:

    remark.port_group_list = [ingress_remark_group, egress_remark_group]
    remark.ingress_remark_group.packet_priority_remark_set = [dscp]
    remark.remark_port_group.port_set = swp1-swp4,swp6
    remark.egress_remark_group.port_set = swp10-swp20
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_0.priority_remark.dscp = [2]
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_1.priority_remark.dscp = [10]
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_2.priority_remark.dscp = [18]
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_3.priority_remark.dscp = [26]
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_4.priority_remark.dscp = [34]
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_5.priority_remark.dscp = [42]
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_6.priority_remark.dscp = [50]
    remark.egress_remark_group.cos_7.priority_remark.dscp = [58]

## Configure Traffic Marking through ACL Rules

You can mark traffic for egress packets through `iptables` or
`ip6tables` rule classifications. To enable these rules, you do one of
the following:

  - Mark DSCP values in egress packets.
  - Mark 802.1p CoS values in egress packets.

To enable traffic marking, use `cl-acltool`. Add the `-p` option to
specify the location of the policy file. By default, if you don't
include the `-p` option, `cl-acltool` looks for the policy file in
`/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/`.

The `iptables`-/`ip6tables`-based marking is supported via the following
action extension:

    -j SETQOS --set-dscp 10 --set-cos 5

For `ebtables`, the setqos keyword must be in lowercase, as in:

    [ebtables]
    -A FORWARD -o swp5 -j setqos --set-cos 5

You can specify one of the following targets for SETQOS/setqos:

| Option                  | Description   |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| \--set-cos INT          | Sets the datapath resource/queuing class value. Values are defined in [IEEE\_P802.1p](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_P802.1p).         |
| \--set-dscp value       | Sets the DSCP field in packet header to a value, which can be either a decimal or hex value.  |
| \--set-dscp-class class | Sets the DSCP field in the packet header to the value represented by the DiffServ class value. This class can be EF, BE or any of the CSxx or AFxx classes. |

{{%notice note%}}

You can specify either `--set-dscp` or `--set-dscp-class`, but not both.

{{%/notice%}}

Here are two example rules:

    [iptables]
    -t mangle -A FORWARD --in-interface swp+ -p tcp --dport bgp -j SETQOS --set-dscp 10 --set-cos 5
     
    [ip6tables]
    -t mangle -A FORWARD --in-interface swp+ -j SETQOS --set-dscp 10

You can put the rule in either the *mangle* table or the default
*filter* table; the mangle table and filter table are put into separate
TCAM slices in the hardware.

To put the rule in the mangle table, include `-t mangle`; to put the
rule in the filter table, omit `-t mangle`.

## Configure Priority Flow Control

*Priority flow control*, as defined in the 
[IEEE 802.1Qbb standard](http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1bb.html), provides a
link-level flow control mechanism that can be controlled independently
for each Class of Service (CoS) with the intention to ensure no data
frames are lost when congestion occurs in a bridged network.

PFC is a layer 2 mechanism that prevents congestion by throttling packet
transmission. When PFC is enabled for received packets on a set of
switch ports, the switch detects congestion in the ingress buffer of the
receiving port and signals the upstream switch to stop sending traffic.
If the upstream switch has PFC enabled for packet transmission on the
designated priorities, it responds to the downstream switch and stops
sending those packets for a period of time.

PFC operates between two adjacent neighbor switches; it does not provide
end-to-end flow control. However, when an upstream neighbor throttles
packet transmission, it could build up packet congestion and propagate
PFC frames further upstream: eventually the sending server could receive
PFC frames and stop sending traffic for a time.

The PFC mechanism can be enabled for individual switch priorities on
specific switch ports for RX and/or TX traffic. The switch port’s
ingress buffer occupancy is used to measure congestion. If congestion is
present, the switch transmits flow control frames to the upstream
switch. Packets with priority values that do not have PFC configured are
not counted during congestion detection; neither do they get throttled
by the upstream switch when it receives flow control frames.

PFC congestion detection is implemented on the switch using xoff and xon
threshold values for the specific ingress buffer which is used by the
targeted switch priorities. When a packet enters the buffer and the
buffer occupancy is above the xoff threshold, the switch transmits an
Ethernet PFC frame to the upstream switch to signal packet transmission
should stop. When the buffer occupancy drops below the xon threshold,
the switch sends another PFC frame upstream to signal that packet
transmission can resume. (PFC frames contain a quanta value to indicate
a timeout value for the upstream switch: packet transmission can resume
after the timer has expired, or when a PFC frame with quanta == 0 is
received from the downstream switch.)

After the downstream switch has sent a PFC frame upstream, it continues
to receive packets until the upstream switch receives and responds to
the PFC frame. The downstream ingress buffer must be large enough to
store those additional packets after the xoff threshold has been
reached.

{{%notice note%}}

Before Cumulus Linux 3.1.1, PFC was designated as a *lossless* priority
group. The lossless priority group has been removed from Cumulus Linux.

{{%/notice%}}

Priority flow control is fully supported on both
[Broadcom](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?asic%5B0%5D=Broadcom%20Apollo2&asic%5B1%5D=Broadcom%20Firebolt3&asic%5B2%5D=Broadcom%20Helix4&asic%5B3%5D=Broadcom%20Hurricane2&asic%5B4%5D=Broadcom%20Maverick&asic%5B5%5D=Broadcom%20Tomahawk&asic%5B6%5D=Broadcom%20Tomahawk%2B&asic%5B7%5D=Broadcom%20Tomahawk2&asic%5B8%5D=Broadcom%20Trident&asic%5B9%5D=Broadcom%20Trident%2B&asic%5B10%5D=Broadcom%20Trident2&asic%5B11%5D=Broadcom%20Trident2%2B&asic%5B12%5D=Broadcom%20Trident3%20X7&asic%5B13%5D=Broadcom%20Triumph2&CPUType=x86_64&Brand%5B0%5D=broadcomtrident&Brand%5B1%5D=broadcomtridentplus&Brand%5B2%5D=broadcomtrident2plus&Brand%5B3%5D=broadcomtriumph2&SwitchSilicon=broadcomtrident2)
and [Mellanox](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?vendor_name%5B0%5D=Mellanox) switches.

PFC is disabled by default in Cumulus Linux. Enabling priority flow
control (PFC) requires configuring the following settings in
`/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` on the switch:

  - Specifying the name of the port group in `pfc.port_group_list` in
    brackets; for example, *pfc.port\_group\_list =
    \[pfc\_port\_group\]*.
  - Assigning a CoS value to the port group in
    `pfc.pfc_port_group.cos_list` setting. Note that *pfc\_port\_group*
    is the name of a port group you specified above and is used
    throughout the following settings.
  - Populating the port group with its member ports in
    `pfc.pfc_port_group.port_set`.
  - Setting a PFC buffer size in `pfc.pfc_port_group.port_buffer_bytes`.
    This is the maximum number of bytes allocated for storing bursts of
    packets, guaranteed at the ingress port. The default is *25000*
    bytes.
  - Setting the xoff byte limit in `pfc.pfc_port_group.xoff_size`. This
    is a threshold for the PFC buffer; when this limit is reached, an
    xoff transition is initiated, signaling the upstream port to stop
    sending traffic, during which time packets continue to arrive due to
    the latency of the communication. The default is *10000* bytes.
  - Setting the xon delta limit in `pfc.pfc_port_group.xon_delta`. This
    is the number of bytes to subtract from the xoff limit, which
    results in a second threshold at which the egress port resumes
    sending traffic. After the xoff limit is reached and the upstream
    port stops sending traffic, the buffer begins to drain. When the
    buffer reaches 8000 bytes (assuming default xoff and xon settings),
    the egress port signals that it can start receiving traffic again.
    The default is *2000* bytes.
  - Enabling the egress port to signal the upstream port to stop sending
    traffic (`pfc.pfc_port_group.tx_enable`). The default is *true*.
  - Enabling the egress port to receive notifications and act on them
    (`pfc.pfc_port_group.rx_enable`). The default is *true*.
  - The switch priority value(s) are mapped to the specific ingress
    buffer for each targeted switch port. Cumulus Linux looks at either
    the 802.1p bits or the IP layer DSCP bits depending on which is
    configured in the `traffic.conf` file to map packets to internal
    switch priority values.

The following configuration example shows PFC configured for ports swp1
through swp4 and swp6:

```

## Port Groups

A *port group* refers to one or more sequences of contiguous ports.
Multiple port groups can be defined by:

  - Adding a comma-separated list of port group names to the
    port\_group\_list.
  - Adding the port\_set, rx\_enable, and tx\_enable configuration lines
    for each port group.

You can specify the set of ports in a port group in comma-separated
sequences of contiguous ports; you can see which ports are contiguous in
`/var/lib/cumulus/porttab`. The syntax supports:

  - A single port (swp1s0 or swp5)
  - A sequence of regular swp ports (swp2-swp5)
  - A sequence within a breakout swp port (swp6s0-swp6s3)
  - A sequence of regular and breakout ports, provided they are all in a
    contiguous range. For example:

        ...
        swp2
        swp3
        swp4
        swp5
        swp6s0
        swp6s1
        swp6s2
        swp6s3
        swp7
        ...

## Configure Link Pause

The PAUSE frame is a flow control mechanism that halts the transmission
of the transmitter for a specified period of time. A server or other
network node within the data center may be receiving traffic faster than
it can handle it, thus the PAUSE frame. In Cumulus Linux, individual
ports can be configured to execute link pause by:

  - Transmitting pause frames when its ingress buffers become congested
    (TX pause enable) and/or
  - Responding to received pause frames (RX pause enable).

Link pause is disabled by default. Enabling link pause requires
configuring settings in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`, similar to
how you configure priority flow control. The settings are explained in
that section as well.

{{%notice tip%}}

What's the difference between link pause and priority flow control?

Priority flow control is applied to an individual priority group for a
specific ingress port.

Link pause (also known as port pause or global pause) is applied to all
the traffic for a specific ingress port.

{{%/notice%}}

Here is an example configuration that enables both types of link pause
for swp1 through swp4 and swp6:

```
# to configure pause on a group of ports:
# -- add or replace port group names in the port group list
# -- for each port group in the list
#    -- populate the port set, e.g.
#       swp1-swp4,swp8,swp50s0-swp50s3
#    -- set a pause buffer size in bytes for each port in the group
#    -- set the xoff byte limit (buffer limit that triggers pause frames transmit to start)
#    -- set the xon byte delta (buffer limit that triggers pause frames transmit to stop)
 
# link pause
link_pause.port_group_list = [pause_port_group]
link_pause.pause_port_group.port_set = swp1-swp4,swp6
link_pause.pause_port_group.port_buffer_bytes = 25000
link_pause.pause_port_group.xoff_size = 10000
link_pause.pause_port_group.xon_delta = 2000
link_pause.pause_port_group.rx_enable = true
link_pause.pause_port_group.tx_enable = true
```

[Restart `switchd`](../../System-Configuration/Configuring-switchd/#restart-switchd)
to allow link pause configuration changes to take effect:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart switchd.service

## Configure Cut-through Mode and Store and Forward Switching

Cut-through mode is disabled in Cumulus Linux by default on switches
with Broadcom ASICs. With cut-though mode enabled and link pause is
asserted, Cumulus Linux generates a TOVR and TUFL ERROR; certain error
counters increment on a given physical port.

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ethtool -S swp49 | grep Error
    HwIfInDot3LengthErrors: 0
    HwIfInErrors: 0
    HwIfInDot3FrameErrors: 0
    SoftInErrors: 0
    SoftInFrameErrors: 0
    HwIfOutErrors: 35495749
    SoftOutErrors: 0
     
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ethtool -S swp50 | grep Error
    HwIfInDot3LengthErrors: 3038098
    HwIfInErrors: 297595762
    HwIfInDot3FrameErrors: 293710518

To work around this issue, disable link pause or disable cut-through
mode in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`.

To disable link pause, comment out the `link_pause*` section in
`/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf
    #link_pause.port_group_list = [port_group_0]
    #link_pause.port_group_0.port_set = swp45-swp54
    #link_pause.port_group_0.rx_enable = true
    #link_pause.port_group_0.tx_enable = true

To enable store and forward switching, set `cut_through_enable` to
*false* in `/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf
    cut_through_enable = false

{{%notice note%}}

On switches using Broadcom Tomahawk, Trident II, Trident II+, and
Trident3 ASICs, Cumulus Linux supports store and forward switching but
does **not** support cut-through mode.

On switches using Spectrum ASICs, Cumulus Linux supports cut-through mode but does **not** support store and forward switching.

## Configure Explicit Congestion Notification

*Explicit Congestion Notification* (ECN) is defined by
[RFC 3168](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3168). ECN gives a Cumulus
Linux switch the ability to mark a packet to signal impending congestion
instead of dropping the packet outright, which is how TCP typically
behaves when ECN is not enabled.

ECN is a layer 3 end-to-end congestion notification mechanism only.
Packets can be marked as *ECN-capable transport* (ECT) by the sending
server. If congestion is observed by any switch while the packet is
getting forwarded, the ECT-enabled packet can be marked by the switch to
indicate the congestion. The end receiver can respond to the ECN-marked
packets by signaling the sending server to slow down transmission. The
sending server marks a packet *ECT* by setting the least 2 significant
bits in an IP header `DiffServ` (ToS) field to *01* or *10*. A packet
that has the least 2 significant bits set to *00* indicates a
non-ECT-enabled packet.

The ECN mechanism on a switch only marks packets to notify the end
receiver. It does not take any other action or change packet handling in
any way, nor does it respond to packets that have already been marked
ECN by an upstream switch.

{{%notice note%}}

**On Trident II switches only**, if ECN is enabled on a specific queue,
the ASIC also enables RED on the same queue. If the packet is ECT marked
(the ECN bits are 01 or 10), the ECN mechanism executes as described
above. However, if it is entering an ECN-enabled queue but is not ECT
marked (the ECN bits are 00), then the RED mechanism uses the same
threshold and probability values to decide whether to drop the packet.
Packets entering a non-ECN-enabled queue do not get marked or dropped
due to ECN or RED in any case.

{{%/notice%}}

ECN is implemented on the switch using minimum and maximum threshold
values for the egress queue length. When a packet enters the queue and
the average queue length is between the minimum and maximum threshold
values, a configurable probability value will determine whether the
packet will be marked. If the average queue length is above the maximum
threshold value, the packet is always marked.

The downstream switches with ECN enabled perform the same actions as the
traffic is received. If the ECN bits are set, they remain set. The only
way to overwrite ECN bits is to enable it — that is, set the ECN bits to
*11*.

ECN is supported on [Broadcom Tomahawk, Tomahawk2, Trident II, Trident II+ and Trident3, and Mellanox Spectrum switches](https://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl).

<details>
<summary>Click to learn how to configure ECN ... </summary>

ECN is disabled by default in Cumulus Linux. You can enable ECN for
individual switch priorities on specific switch ports. ECN requires
configuring the following settings in
`/etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf` on the switch:

  - Specifying the name of the port group in `ecn.port_group_list` in
    brackets; for example, `ecn.port_group_list = [ecn_port_group]`.
  - Assigning a CoS value to the port group in
    `ecn.ecn_port_group.cos_list`. If the CoS value of a packet matches
    the value of this setting, then ECN is applied. Note that
    *ecn\_port\_group* is the name of a port group you specified above.
  - Populating the port group with its member ports
    (`ecn.ecn_port_group.port_set`), where *ecn\_port\_group* is the
    name of the port group you specified above. Congestion is measured
    on the egress port queue for the ports listed here, using the
    average queue length: if congestion is present, a packet entering
    the queue may be marked to indicate that congestion was observed.
    Marking a packet involves setting the least 2 significant bits in
    the IP header DiffServ (ToS) field to *11*.
  - The switch priority value(s) are mapped to specific egress queues
    for the target switch ports.
  - The `ecn.ecn_port_group.probability` value indicates the probability
    of a packet being marked if congestion is experienced.

The following configuration example shows ECN configured for ports swp1
through swp4 and swp6:

    # Explicit Congestion Notification
    # to configure ECN on a group of ports:
    # -- add or replace port group names in the port group list
    # -- assign cos value(s) to the cos list  *ECN will only be applied to traffic matching this COS*
    # -- for each port group in the list
    #    -- populate the port set, e.g.
    #       swp1-swp4,swp8,swp50s0-swp50s3
     ecn.port_group_list = [ecn_port_group]
     ecn.ecn_port_group.cos_list = [0]
     ecn.ecn_port_group.port_set = swp1-swp4,swp6
     ecn.ecn_port_group.min_threshold_bytes = 40000
     ecn.ecn_port_group.max_threshold_bytes = 200000
     ecn.ecn_port_group.probability = 100

## Check Interface Buffer Status

On switches with [Spectrum ASICs](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?asic%5B0%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum&asic%5B1%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum_A1), you can collect a fine-grained history of queue lengths using histograms maintained by the ASIC; see the [ASIC monitoring chapter](../../Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/ASIC-Monitoring) for details.

On Broadcom switches, the buffer status is not visible currently.
