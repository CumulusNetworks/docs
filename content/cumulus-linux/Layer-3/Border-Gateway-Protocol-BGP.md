BGP is the routing protocol that runs the Internet. It is an
increasingly popular protocol for use in the data center as it lends
itself well to the rich interconnections in a Clos topology.
Specifically, BGP:

  - Does not require the routing state to be periodically refreshed,
    unlike OSPF.
  - Is less chatty than its link-state siblings. For example, a link or
    node transition can result in a bestpath change, causing BGP to send
    updates.
  - Is multi-protocol and extensible.
  - Has many robust vendor implementations.
  - Is very mature as a protocol and comes with many years of
    operational experience.

[RFC 7938](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938) provides further details
of the use of BGP within the data center.

## Autonomous System Number (ASN)

One of the key concepts in BGP is an *autonomous system number* or ASN. An
[autonomous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_System_%28Internet%29)
is defined as a set of routers under a common administration. Because
BGP was originally designed to peer between independently managed
enterprises and/or service providers, each such enterprise is treated as
an autonomous system, responsible for a set of network addresses. Each
such autonomous system is given a unique number called its ASN. ASNs are
handed out by a central authority (ICANN). However, ASNs between 64512
and 65535 are reserved for private use. Using BGP within the data center
relies on either using this number space or using the single ASN you own.

The ASN is central to how BGP builds a forwarding topology. A BGP route
advertisement carries with it not only the originatorâ€™s ASN, but also
the list of ASNs that this route advertisement has passed through. When
forwarding a route advertisement, a BGP speaker adds itself to this
list. This list of ASNs is called the *AS path*. BGP uses the AS path to
detect and avoid loops.

ASNs were originally 16-bit numbers, but were later modified to be
32-bit. FRRouting supports both 16-bit and 32-bit ASNs, but most
implementations still run with 16-bit ASNs.

## eBGP and iBGP

When BGP is used to peer between autonomous systems, the peering is
referred to as *external BGP* or eBGP. When BGP is used within an
autonomous system, the peering used is referred to as *internal BGP* or
iBGP. eBGP peers have different ASNs while iBGP peers have the same ASN.

The heart of the protocol is the same when used as eBGP or iBGP,
however, there is a key difference in the protocol behavior between use
as eBGP and iBGP: an iBGP speaker does not forward routing information
learned from one iBGP peer to another iBGP peer to prevent loops. eBGP
prevents loops using the AS\_Path attribute.

All iBGP speakers need to be peered with each other in a full mesh. In a
large network, this requirement can quickly become unscalable. The most
popular method to scale iBGP networks is to introduce a *route
reflector*.

## Route Reflectors

In a two-tier Clos network, the leaf (or tier 1) switches are the only
ones connected to end stations. The spines themselves do not have any
routes to announce; they are merely **reflecting** the routes announced
by one leaf to the other leaves. Therefore, the spine switches function
as route reflectors while the leaf switches serve as route reflector
clients.

In a three-tier network, the tier 2 nodes (or mid-tier spines) act as
both route reflector servers and route reflector clients. They act as
route reflectors because they announce the routes learned from the tier
1 nodes to other tier 1 nodes and to tier 3 nodes. They also act as
route reflector clients to the tier 3 nodes, receiving routes learned
from other tier 2 nodes. Tier 3 nodes act only as route reflectors.

In the following illustration, tier 2 node 2.1 is acting as a route
reflector server, announcing the routes between tier 1 nodes 1.1 and 1.2
to tier 1 node 1.3. It is also a route reflector client, learning the
routes between tier 2 nodes 2.2 and 2.3 from the tier 3 node, 3.1.

{{%notice note%}}

**Configuring route-reflector-client Requires Specific Order**

When configuring a router to be a route reflector client, you must
specify the FRRouting configuration in a specific order; otherwise, the
router will not be a route reflector client.

You must run the `net add bgp neighbor <IPv4/IPV6>
route-reflector-client` command after the `net add bgp neighbor
<IPV4/IPV6> activate` command; otherwise, the `route-reflector-client`
command is ignored. For example:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv4 unicast neighbor 14.0.0.9 activate
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 14.0.0.9 next-hop-self
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 14.0.0.9 route-reflector-client >>> Must be after activate
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 2001:ded:beef:2::1 remote-as 65000
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv6 unicast redistribute connected
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp maximum-paths ibgp 4
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 2001:ded:beef:2::1 activate
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 2001:ded:beef:2::1 next-hop-self
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 2001:ded:beef:2::1 route-reflector-client >>> Must be after activate

{{%/notice%}}

A **cluster consists of route reflectors (RRs) and their clients** and
is used in iBGP environments where multiple sets of route reflectors and
their clients are configured. Configuring a unique ID per cluster (on
the route reflector server and clients) prevents looping as a route
reflector does not accept routes from another that has the same cluster
ID. Additionally, because all route reflectors in the cluster recognize
updates from peers in the same cluster, they do not install routes from
a route reflector in the same cluster; this reduces the number of
updates that need to be stored in BGP routing tables.

To configure a cluster ID on a route reflector, run the
`net add bgp cluster-id (<ipv4>|<1-4294967295>)` command. You can
enter the cluster ID as an IP address or as a 32-bit quantity.

The following example configures a cluster ID on a route reflector in IP
address format:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp cluster-id 14.0.0.9
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

The following example configures a cluster ID on a route reflector as a
32-bit quantity:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp cluster-id 321
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

## ECMP with BGP

If a BGP node hears a prefix **p** from multiple peers, it has all the
information necessary to program the routing table to forward traffic
for that prefix **p** through all of these peers; BGP supports
equal-cost multipathing (ECMP).

To perform ECMP in BGP, you may need to configure 
`net add bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax` (if you are using eBGP).

### Maximum Paths

In Cumulus Linux, the BGP `maximum-paths` setting is enabled by default,
so multiple routes are already installed. The default setting is 64
paths.

### BGP for Both IPv4 and IPv6

Unlike OSPF, which has separate versions of the protocol to announce
IPv4 and IPv6 routes, BGP is a multi-protocol routing engine, capable of
announcing both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. It supports announcing IPv4
prefixes over an IPv4 session and IPv6 prefixes over an IPv6 session. It
also supports announcing prefixes of both these address families over a
single IPv4 session or over a single IPv6 session.

## Configure BGP

The following example shows a basic BGP configuration. The rest of this
chapter discusses how to configure other BGP features, such as
unnumbered interfaces to route maps.

1.  Enable the BGP and Zebra daemons (`zebra` and `bgpd`), then enable
    the FRRouting service and start it, as described in [Configuring
    FRRouting](/cumulus-linux/Layer-3/Configuring-FRRouting/).

2.  Identify the BGP node by assigning an ASN and `router-id`:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65000
        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp router-id 10.0.0.1

3.  Specify where to disseminate routing information:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as external

    For an iBGP session, the `remote-as` is the same as the local AS:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as internal

    Specifying the IP address of the peer allows BGP to set up a TCP
    socket with this peer, but it does not distribute any prefixes to
    it, unless it is explicitly told that it must with the `activate`
    command. You must specify the `activate` command for each address
    family that is being announced by the BGP session.

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv4 unicast neighbor 10.0.0.2 activate
        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv6 unicast neighbor 2001:db8:0002::0a00:0002 activate

4.  Specify BGP session properties:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 10.0.0.2 next-hop-self

    If this is a route reflector client, it can be specified as follows:

        cumulus@switchRR:~$ net add bgp neighbor 10.0.0.1 route-reflector-client

    {{%notice note%}}

It is node *switchRR*, the route reflector, on which the peer is
    specified as a client.

    {{%/notice%}}

5.  Specify which prefixes to originate:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv4 unicast network 192.0.2.0/24
        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv4 unicast network 203.0.113.1/24
        cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
        cumulus@switch:~$ net commit


## BGP Unnumbered Interfaces

Unnumbered interfaces are interfaces without unique IP addresses. In
BGP, you configure unnumbered interfaces using *extended next hop
encoding* (ENHE), which is defined by
[RFC 5549](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5549). BGP unnumbered
interfaces provide a means of advertising an IPv4 route with an IPv6
next hop. Prior to RFC 5549, an IPv4 route could be advertised only with
an IPv4 next hop.

BGP unnumbered interfaces are particularly useful in deployments where
IPv4 prefixes are advertised through BGP over a section without any IPv4
address configuration on links. As a result, the routing entries are
also IPv4 for destination lookup and have IPv6 next hops for forwarding
purposes.

### BGP and Extended Next Hop Encoding

When enabled and active, BGP makes use of the available IPv6 next hops
for advertising any IPv4 prefixes. BGP learns the prefixes, calculates
the routes and installs them in IPv4 AFI to IPv6 AFI format. However,
ENHE in Cumulus Linux does not install routes into the kernel in IPv4
prefix to IPv6 next hop format. For link-local peerings enabled by
dynamically learning the other end's link-local address using IPv6
neighbor discovery router advertisements, an IPv6 next hop is converted
into an IPv4 link-local address and a static neighbor entry is installed
for this IPv4 link-local address with the MAC address derived from the
link-local address of the other end.

{{%notice note%}}

It is assumed that the IPv6 implementation on the peering device uses
the MAC address as the interface ID when assigning the IPv6 link-local
address, as suggested by RFC 4291.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux 3.7.2 and later also supports advertising IPv4 prefixes
with IPv6 next hop addresses while peering over IPv6 global unicast
addresses. See
[RFC 5549 Support with Global IPv6 Peers](#configure-rfc-5549-support-with-global-ipv6-peers) below.

{{%/notice%}}

### Configure BGP Unnumbered Interfaces

To configure a BGP unnumbered interface, you must enable IPv6 neighbor
discovery router advertisements. The `interval` you specify is measured
in seconds and defaults to 10 seconds.

In Cumulus Linux 3.7.1 and earlier, extended next hop encoding is sent
only for the link-local address peerings (as shown below). In Cumulus
Linux 3.7.2 and later, extended next hop encoding can be sent for the
both link-local and global unicast address peerings (see
[RFC 5549 Support with Global IPv6 Peers](#configure-rfc-5549-support-with-global-ipv6-peers).

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65020
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp router-id 10.0.0.21
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp bestpath compare-routerid
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor fabric peer-group
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor fabric remote-as external
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor fabric description Internal Fabric Network
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor fabric capability extended-nexthop
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp1 interface peer-group fabric
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp2 interface peer-group fabric
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp3 interface peer-group fabric
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp4 interface peer-group fabric
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp29 interface peer-group fabric
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp30 interface peer-group fabric

These commands create the following configuration in the
`/etc/frr/frr.conf` file:

    router bgp 65020
     bgp router-id 10.0.0.21
     bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
     bgp bestpath compare-routerid
     neighbor fabric peer-group
     neighbor fabric remote-as external
     neighbor fabric description Internal Fabric Network
     neighbor fabric capability extended-nexthop
     neighbor swp1 interface peer-group fabric
     neighbor swp2 interface peer-group fabric
     neighbor swp3 interface peer-group fabric
     neighbor swp4 interface peer-group fabric
     neighbor swp29 interface peer-group fabric
     neighbor swp30 interface peer-group fabric
    !

For an unnumbered configuration, you can use a single command to
configure a neighbor and attach it to a
[peer group](#peer-groups-to-simplify-configuration) (making sure
to substitute for the interface and peer group below):

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor <swpX> interface peer-group <group name>



### Manage Unnumbered Interfaces

The following commands show how the IPv4 link-local address
*169.254.0.1* is used to install the route and static neighbor entry to
facilitate proper forwarding without having to install an IPv4 prefix

You can use the following command to display more neighbor information:

    cumulus@switch:~$ ip neighbor

    fe80::4638:39ff:fe00:5c dev swp51 lladdr 44:38:39:00:00:5c router REACHABLE

### How traceroute Interacts with BGP Unnumbered Interfaces

Every router or end host must have an IPv4 address to complete a
`traceroute` of IPv4 addresses. In this case, the IPv4 address used is
that of the loopback device.

Even if ENHE is not used in the data center, link addresses are not
typically advertised. This is because:

  - Link addresses take up valuable FIB resources. In a large Clos
    environment, the number of such addresses can be quite large.
  - Link addresses expose an additional attack vector for intruders to
    use to either break in or engage in DDOS attacks.

Assigning an IP address to the loopback device is essential.


### Advanced: How Next Hop Fields Are Set

This section describes how the IPv6 next hops are set in the MP\_REACH\_NLRI
([multiprotocol reachable NLRI](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2858.txt)) initiated by the system,
which applies whether IPv6 prefixes or IPv4 prefixes are exchanged with
ENHE. There are two main aspects to determine â€” how many IPv6 next hops
are included in the MP\_REACH\_NLRI (since the RFC allows either one or
two next hops) and the values of the nexthop(s). This section also
describes how a received MP\_REACH\_NLRI is handled as far as processing
IPv6 next hops.

  - Whether peering to a global IPv6 address or link-local IPv6 address,
    the determination whether to send one or two next hops is as
    follows:

    1.  If reflecting the route, two next hops are sent only if the peer
        has `nexthop-local unchanged` configured and the attribute of
        the received route has an IPv6 link-local next hop; otherwise,
        only one next hop is sent.

    2.  Otherwise (if it is not reflecting the route), two next hops are
        sent if explicitly configured (`nexthop-local unchanged`) or the
        peer is directly connected (that is, either peering is on
        link-local address or the global IPv4 or IPv6 address is
        *directly connected*) and the route is either a
        local/self-originated route or the peer is an eBGP peer.

    3.  In all other cases, only one next hop gets sent, unless an
        outbound route map adds another next hop.

  - `route-map` can impose two next hops in scenarios where Cumulus
    Linux only sends one next hop â€” by specifying `set ipv6 nexthop
    link-local`.
  - For all routes to eBGP peers and self-originated routes to iBGP
    peers, the global next hop (first value) is the peering address of
    the local system. If the peering is on the link-local address, this
    is the global IPv6 address on the peering interface, if present;
    otherwise, it is the link-local IPv6 address on the peering
    interface.
  - For other routes to iBGP peers (eBGP to iBGP or reflected), the
    global next hop will be the global next hop in the received
    attribute.

    {{%notice note%}}

If this address is a link-local IPv6 address, it is reset so that
    the link-local IPv6 address of the eBGP peer is not passed along to
    an iBGP peer, which most likely is on a different link.

    {{%/notice%}}

  - `route-map` and/or the peer configuration can change the above
    behavior. For example, `route-map` can set the global IPv6 next hop
    or the peer configuration can set it to *self* â€” which is relevant
    for *iBGP* peers. The route map or peer configuration can also set
    the next hop to unchanged, which ensures the source IPv6 global next
    hop is passed around â€” which is relevant for *eBGP* peers.
  - Whenever two next hops are being sent, the link-local next hop (the
    second value of the two) is the link-local IPv6 address on the
    peering interface unless it is due to `nh-local-unchanged` or
    `route-map` has set the link-local next hop.
  - Network administrators cannot set [martian
    values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_packet) for IPv6 next
    hops in `route-map`. Also, global and link-local next hops are
    validated to ensure they match the respective address types.
  - In a received update, a martian check is imposed for the IPv6 global
    next hop. If the check fails, it gets treated as an implicit
    withdraw.
  - If two next hops are received in an update and the second next hop
    is not a link-local address, it gets ignored and the update is
    treated as if only one next hop was received.
  - Whenever two next hops are received in an update, the second next
    hop is used to install the route into `zebra`. As per the previous
    point, it is already assured that this is a link-local IPv6 address.
    Currently, this is assumed to be reachable and is not registered
    with NHT.
  - When `route-map` specifies the next hop as `peer-address`, the
    global IPv6 next hop as well as the link-local IPv6 next hop (if
    it's being sent) is set to the *peering address*. If the peering is
    on a link-local address, the former could be the link-local address
    on the peering interface, unless there is a global IPv6 address
    present on this interface.
  - When using iBGP unnumbered with IPv6 Link Local Addresses (the
    default), FRR rewrites the BGP next hop to be the adjacent link.
    This is similar behavior to eBGP next hops. However, iBGP route
    advertisement rules do not change and a full mesh or route
    reflectors is still required.

The above rules imply that there are scenarios where a generated update
has two IPv6 next hops, and both of them are the IPv6 link-local address
of the peering interface on the local system. If you are peering with a
switch or router that is not running Cumulus Linux and expects the first
next hop to be a global IPv6 address, a route map can be used on the
sender to specify a global IPv6 address. This conforms with the
recommendations in the Internet draft
[draft-kato-bgp-ipv6-link-local-00.txt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kato-bgp-ipv6-link-local-00),
"BGP4+ Peering Using IPv6 Link-local Address".

### Limitations

  - Interface-based peering with separate IPv4 and IPv6 sessions is not
    supported.
  - In Cumulus Linux 3.7.1 and earlier, ENHE is sent for IPv6 link-local
    peerings only. In Cumulus Linux 3.7.2 and later, ENHE can also be
    also sent for IPv6 GUA peerings (see below).
  - If an IPv4 /30 or /31 IP address is assigned to the interface, IPv4
    peering is used over IPv6 link-local peering.
  - If the default router lifetime in the generated IPv6 route
    advertisements (RA) is set to *0*, the receiving FRRouting instance
    drops the RA if it is on a Cumulus Linux **2.5.z** switch. To work
    around this issue, either:
      - Explicitly configure the switch to advertise a router lifetime
        of 0, unless a value is specifically set by the operator â€” with
        the assumption that the host is running Cumulus Linux 3.y.z
        version of FRRouting. When hosts see an IPv6 RA with a router
        lifetime of 0, they do not make that router a default router.
      - Use the `sysctl` on the host â€”
        `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra_defrtr`. However, this requires
        applying this setting on all hosts, which might mean many hosts,
        especially if FRRouting is run on the hosts.

## RFC 5549 Support with Global IPv6 Peers (Cumulus Linux 3.7.2 and later)

[RFC 5549](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5549) defines the method used
for BGP to advertise IPv4 prefixes with IPv6 next hops. The RFC does not
make a distinction between whether the IPv6 peering and next hop values
should be global unicast addresses (GUA) or link-local addresses.
Cumulus Linux 3.7.1 and earlier only supports advertising IPv4 prefixes
using link-local IPv6 next hop addresses via BGP *unnumbered* peering.
Cumulus Linux 3.7.2 supports advertising IPv4 prefixes with IPv6 global
unicast and link-local next hop addresses, with either *unnumbered* or
*numbered* BGP.

When BGP peering uses IPv6 global addresses and IPv4 prefixes are being
advertised and installed, IPv6 route advertisements are used to derive
the MAC address of the peer so that FRR can create an IPv4 route with a
link-local IPv4 next hop address (defined by RFC 3927). This is required
to install the route into the kernel. These route advertisement settings
are configured automatically when FRR receives an update from a BGP peer
using IPv6 global addresses that contain an IPv4 prefix with an IPv6
nexthop, and the enhanced-nexthop capability has been negotiated.

### Configure RFC 5549 Support with Global IPv6 Peers

To enable advertisement of IPv4 prefixes with IPv6 next hops over global
IPv6 peerings, add the `extended-nexthop` capability to the global IPv6
neighbor statements on each end of the BGP sessions.

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 2001:1:1::3 capability extended-nexthop
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

The above commands create the following configuration in the
`/etc/frr/frr.conf` file:

    router bgp 1
     bgp router-id 10.0.0.11
     neighbor 2001:1:1::3 remote-as external
     neighbor 2001:1:1::3 capability extended-nexthop
     !

Ensure that the IPv6 peers are activated under the IPv4 unicast address
family; otherwise, all peers are activated in the IPv4 unicast address
family by default.  
If `no bgp default ipv4-unicast` is configured, you need to explicitly
activate the IPv6 neighbor under the IPv4 unicast address family as
shown below:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 2001:1:1::3 capability extended-nexthop
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv4 unicast neighbor 2001:1:1::3 activate
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

The above commands create the following configuration in the
`/etc/frr/frr.conf` file:

    router bgp 1 bgp
    router-id 10.0.0.11
    no bgp default ipv4-unicast
    neighbor 2001:1:1::3 remote-as external
    neighbor 2001:1:1::3 capability extended-nexthop
    !
    address-family ipv4 unicast
     neighbor 2001:1:1::3 activate
    exit-address-family

### Show IPv4 Prefixes Learned with IPv6 Next Hops

To show IPv4 prefixes learned with IPv6 next hops, you can run `net show
bgp ipv4 unicast` commands.

{{%notice info has%}}

The following examples show an IPv4 prefix learned from a BGP peer over
an IPv6 session using IPv6 global addresses, but where the next hop
installed by BGP is a link-local IPv6 address. This occurs when the
session is directly between peers and both link-local and global IPv6
addresses are included as next hops in the BGP update for the prefix. If
both global and link-local next hops exist, BGP prefers the link-local
address for route installation.

If an IPv4 prefix is learned with only an IPv6 global next hop address
(for example, when the route is learned through a route reflector), the
command output shows the IPv6 global address as the next hop value and
shows that it is learned recursively through the link-local address of
the route reflector. Note that when a global IPv6 address is used as a
next hop for route installation in the FRR RIB, it is still converted
into an IPv4 link-local address for installation into the kernel.

To have only IPv6 global addresses used for route installation into the
FRR RIB, you must add an additional route map to the neighbor or peer
group statement in the appropriate address family. When the route map
command `set ipv6 next-hop prefer-global` is applied to a neighbor, if
both a link-local and global IPv6 address are in the BGP update for a
prefix, the IPv6 global address is preferred for route installation.

With this additional configuration, the output in the FRR RIB changes in
the direct neighbor case, as shown below:

    router bgp 1
     bgp router-id 10.0.0.11
     neighbor 2001:2:2::4 remote-as internal
     neighbor 2001:2:2::4 capability extended-nexthop
     !
     address-family ipv4 unicast
      neighbor 2001:2:2::4 route-map GLOBAL in
     exit-address-family
    !
    route-map GLOBAL permit 20
     set ipv6 next-hop prefer-global
    !

The resulting FRR RIB output is as follows:

    Spine01# sh ip route
    Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP,
       O - OSPF, I - IS-IS, B - BGP, E - EIGRP, N - NHRP,

## BGP add-path

Cumulus Linux supports both BGP add-path RX and BGP add-path TX.

### BGP add-path RX

*BGP add-path RX* allows BGP to receive multiple paths for the same
prefix. A path identifier is used so that additional paths do not
override previously advertised paths. No additional configuration is
required for BGP add-path RX.

{{%notice note%}}

BGP advertises the add-path RX capability by default. Add-Path TX
requires an administrator to enable it. Enabling TX resets the session.

{{%/notice%}}

To view the existing capabilities, run `net show bgp neighbor`. The
existing capabilities are listed in the subsection *Add Path*, below
*Neighbor capabilities:*

    ...

The example output above shows that additional BGP paths can be sent and
received (TX and RX are advertised). It also shows that the BGP
neighbor, fe80::4638:39ff:fe00:5c, supports both.

To view the current additional paths, run `net show bgp <network>`. The
example output shows an additional path that has been added by the TX
node for receiving. Each path has a unique AddPath ID.

### BGP add-path TX

AddPath TX allows BGP to advertise more than just the bestpath for a
prefix. Consider the following topology:

```
          r8
          |
          |
  r1 ----    ---- r6
  r2 ---- r7 ---- r5
          ||
          ||
        r3 r4
```

In this topology:

  - r1 and r2 are in AS 100
  - r3 and r4 are in AS 300
  - r5 and r6 are in AS 500
  - r7 is in AS 700
  - r8 is in AS 800
  - r7 learns 1.1.1.1/32 from r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, and r6. Among these r7
    picks the path from r1 as the bestpath for 1.1.1.1/32

The example below configures the r7 session to advertise the bestpath
learned from each AS. In this case, this means a path from AS 100, a
path from AS 300, and a path from AS 500. The `net show bgp 1.1.1.1/32`
from r7 has "bestpath-from-AS 100" so the user can see what the bestpath
is from each AS:

    cumulus@r7:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 700
    cumulus@r7:~$ net add bgp neighbor 192.0.2.2 addpath-tx-bestpath-per-AS

The output below shows the result on r8:

## Fast Convergence Design Considerations

Cumulus Networks strongly recommends the following use of addresses in
the design of a BGP-based data center network:

  - Set up BGP sessions only using interface-scoped addresses. This
    allows BGP to react quickly to link failures.
  - Use of next hop-self: Every BGP node says that it knows how to
    forward traffic to the prefixes it is announcing. This reduces the
    requirement to announce interface-specific addresses and thereby
    reduces the size of the forwarding table.

When you configure BGP for the neighbors of a given interface, you can
specify the interface name instead of its IP address. All the other
`neighbor` command options remain the same.

This is equivalent to BGP peering to the link-local IPv6 address of the
neighbor on the given interface. The link-local address is learned via
IPv6 neighbor discovery router advertisements.

Consider the following example configuration in the `/etc/frr/frr.conf`
file:

    router bgp 65000
      bgp router-id 10.0.0.1
      neighbor swp1 interface
      neighbor swp1 remote-as internal
      neighbor swp1 next-hop-self
    !
      address-family ipv6
      neighbor swp1 activate
      exit-address-family

You create the above configuration with the following NCLU commands:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65000
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp router-id 10.0.0.1
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp1 interface
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp1 remote-as internal
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp1 next-hop-self
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv6 unicast neighbor swp1 activate

{{%notice note%}}

By default, Cumulus Linux sends IPv6 neighbor discovery router
advertisements. Cumulus Networks recommends you adjust the interval of
the router advertisement to a shorter value (`net add interface
<interface> ipv6 nd ra-interval <interval>`) to address scenarios when
nodes come up and miss router advertisement processing to relay the
neighborâ€™s link-local address to BGP. The `interval` is measured in
seconds and defaults to 10 seconds.

## Peer Groups to Simplify Configuration

When a switch has many peers to connect to, the amount of redundant
configuration becomes overwhelming. For example, repeating the
`activate` and `next-hop-self` commands for even 60 neighbors makes for
a very long configuration file. To address this problem, you can use
`peer-group` .

Instead of specifying properties of each individual peer, FRRouting
allows you to define one or more peer groups and associate all the
attributes common to that peer session to a peer group. A peer needs to
be attached to a peer group only once, when it then inherits all address
families activated for that peer group.

After you attach a peer to a peer group, you need to associate an IP
address with the peer group. The following example shows how to define
and use peer groups:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor tier-2 peer-group
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp ipv4 unicast
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor tier-2 activate
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor tier-2 next-hop-self
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 10.0.0.2 peer-group tier-2
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 192.0.2.2 peer-group tier-2

{{%notice note%}}

BGP peer-group restrictions have been replaced with update-groups, which
dynamically examine all peers and group them if they have the same
outbound policy.

## Configure BGP Dynamic Neighbors

*BGP dynamic neighbor* provides BGP peering to a group of remote
neighbors within a specified range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for a BGP
peer group. You can configure each range as a subnet IP address.

You configure dynamic neighbors using the `bgp listen range <IP address>
peer-group <GROUP>` command. After you configure the dynamic neighbors,
a BGP speaker can listen for, and form peer relationships with, any
neighbor in the IP address range and mapped to a peer group.

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65001
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp listen range 10.1.1.0/24 peer-group SPINE

To limit the number of dynamic peers, specify the limit in the `bgp
listen limit` command (the default value is *100*):

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp listen limit 5

Collectively, a sample configuration for IPv4 looks like this:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65001
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor SPINE peer-group
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor SPINE remote-as 65000
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp listen limit 5
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp listen range 10.1.1.0/24 peer-group SPINE

These commands produce an IPv4 configuration that looks like this:

    router bgp 65001Â 
     neighbor SPINE peer-group
     neighbor SPINE remote-as 65000
      bgp listen limit 5
      bgp listen range 10.1.1.0/24 peer-group SPINE

## Configure BGP Peering Relationships across Switches

A BGP peering relationship is typically initiated with the `neighbor
x.x.x.x remote-as [internal|external]` command.

Specifying *internal* signifies an iBGP peering; that is, the neighbor
only creates or accepts a connection with the specified neighbor if the
remote peer AS number matches this BGP AS number.

Specifying *external* signifies an eBGP peering; that is, the neighbor
will only create a connection with the neighbor if the remote peer AS
number does **not** match this BGP AS number.

You can make this distinction using the `neighbor` command or the
`peer-group` command.

In general, use the following syntax with the `neighbor` command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor [<IP address>|<BGP peer>|<interface>] remote-as [<value>|internal|external]

Some example configurations follow.

To connect to **the same AS** using the `neighbor` command, modify your
configuration similar to the following:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 500
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as internal

These commands create the following configuration snippet:

{{%notice note%}}

In Cumulus Linux 3.7.5 and earlier, the MD5 password configured against
a BGP listen-range peer-group (used to accept and create dynamic BGP
neighbors) is not enforced. This means that connections are accepted
from peers that do not specify a password.

## Configure eBGP Multihop

The eBGP multihop option lets you use BGP to exchange routes with an
external peer that is more than one hop away.

1.  To establish a connection between two eBGP peers that are not
    directly connected:

        cumulus@leaf02:mgmt-vrf:~$ net add bgp neighbor <ip> remote-as external
        cumulus@leaf02:mgmt-vrf:~$ net add bgp neighbor <ip> ebgp-multihop

2.  Confirm the configuration with the `net show bgp neighbor <ip>`
    command:

        cumulus@leaf02:mgmt-vrf:~$ net show bgp neighbor 10.0.0.11
        BGP neighbor is 10.0.0.11, remote AS 65011, local AS 65012, external link

## Configure BGP TTL Security

The steps below show how to configure BGP TTL security on Cumulus Linux
using a leaf (`leaf01`) and spine (`spine01`) for the example output:

1.  SSH into leaf01 and configure it for TTL security:

        cumulus@leaf01:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65000
        cumulus@leaf01:~$ net add bgp neighbor [spine01-IP] ttl-security hops [value]

2.  SSH into spine01 and configure it for TTL security:

        cumulus@spine01:~$ net add bgp autonomous-system 65001
        cumulus@spine01:~$ net add bgp neighbor [leaf01-IP] ttl-security hops [value]

## Configure Graceful BGP Shutdown

To reduce packet loss during planned maintenance of a router or link,
you can configure graceful BGP shutdown, which forces traffic to route
around the node.

To configure graceful BGP shutdown for the current node, run the `net
add bgp graceful-shutdown` command:

    cumulus@spine01:~$ net add bgp graceful-shutdown
    cumulus@spine01:~$ net pending
    cumulus@spine01:~$ net commit

When configured, the `graceful-shutdown` community is added to all paths
from eBGP peers and the `local-pref` for that route is set to 0. An
example configuration is shown below:

    cumulus@switch:~$ show ip bgp 10.1.3.0/24
    BGP routing table entry for 10.1.3.0/24
    Paths: (2 available, best #1, table Default-IP-Routing-Table)
      Advertised to non peer-group peers:
      bottom0(10.1.2.2)
      30 20
        10.1.1.2 (metric 10) from top1(10.1.1.2) (10.1.1.2)

## Configuration Tips

### BGP Advertisement Best Practices

Limiting the exchange of routing information at various parts in the
network is a best practice you should follow. The following image
illustrates one way you can do so in a typical Clos architecture:

{{% imgOld 1 %}}

### Multiple Routing Tables and Forwarding

You can run multiple routing tables (one for in-band/data plane traffic
and one for out-of-band/management plane traffic) on the same switch
using [management VRF](/cumulus-linux/Layer-3/Management-VRF) (multiple
routing tables and forwarding).

{{%notice note%}}

BGP and static routing (IPv4 and IPv6) are supported within a VRF
context. For more information, refer to [Virtual Routing and Forwarding
- VRF](/cumulus-linux/Layer-3/Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF).

{{%/notice%}}

### BGP Community Lists

You can use [*community lists*](http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#community-lists)
to define a BGP community to tag one or more routes. You can then use
the communities to apply route policy on either egress or ingress.

The BGP community list can be either *standard* or *expanded.* The
standard BGP community list is a pair of values (such as *100:100*) that
can be tagged on a specific prefix and advertised to other neighbors or
applied on route ingress. Alternately, it can be one of four BGP default
communities:

  - *internet*: a BGP community that matches all routes
  - *local-AS*: a BGP community that restrict routes to your
    confederation's sub-AS
  - *no-advertise*: a BGP community that isn't advertised to anyone
  - *no-export*: a BGP community that isn't advertised to the eBGP peer

An expanded BGP community list takes a regular expression of communities
matches the listed communities.

When the neighbor receives the prefix, it examines the community value
and takes action accordingly, such as permitting or denying the
community member in the routing policy.

Here is an example of a standard community list filter:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add routing community-list standard COMMUNITY1 permit 100:100

You can apply the community list to a route map to define the routing
policy:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp table-map ROUTE-MAP1


### Additional Default Settings

Other settings not discussed in detail in this chapter that are enabled
by default, include the following:

  - `bgp deterministic-med`, which ensures path ordering no longer
    impacts bestpath selection.
  - `bgp show-hostname`, which displays the hostname in show command
    output.
  - `bgp network import-check`, which enables the advertising of the BGP
    network in IGP.

### Configure BGP Neighbor maximum-prefixes

The maximum number of route announcements, or prefixes, allowed by a BGP
neighbor can be configured using the FRR `maximum-prefixes` command:

    frr(config)# neighbor <peer> maximum-prefix <number>

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot BGP, you can view the summary of neighbors to which the
switch is connected and see information about these connections. The
following example shows sample command output:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show bgp summary
    show bgp ipv4 unicast summary

To see details of a specific route, such as from where it is received

command:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ net show bgp 10.0.0.11/32
BGP routing table entry for 10.0.0.11/32
Paths: (1 available, best #1, table Default-IP-Routing-Table)
  Advertised to non peer-group peers:

      AddPath ID: RX 0, TX 9
      Last update: Fri Nov 18 01:48:17 2016
```

The above example shows that the routing table prefix seen by BGP is
10.0.0.11/32, that this route is advertised to two neighbors, and that
it is not heard by any neighbors.

### Log Neighbor State Changes

To log the changes that a neighbor goes through so that you can
troubleshoot issues associated with that neighbor, run the
`log-neighbor-changes` command, which is enabled by default.

The output is sent to the specified log file, usually
`/var/log/frr/bgpd.log`, and looks like this:

    2016/07/08 10:12:06.572827 BGP: %NOTIFICATION: sent to neighbor 10.0.0.2 6/3 (Cease/Peer Unconfigured) 0 bytes
    2016/07/08 10:12:06.572954 BGP: Notification sent to neighbor 10.0.0.2: type 6/3
    2016/07/08 10:12:16.682071 BGP: %ADJCHANGE: neighbor 192.0.2.2 Up
    2016/07/08 10:12:16.682660 BGP: %ADJCHANGE: neighbor 10.0.0.2 Up

### Troubleshoot Link-local Addresses

To verify that `frr` learned the neighboring link-local IPv6 address via
the IPv6 neighbor discovery router advertisements on a given interface,
run the `show interface <if-name>` command. If `ipv6 nd suppress-ra` is
not enabled on both ends of the interface, then `Neighbor address(s):`
has the other end's link-local address. That is the address that BGP
uses when BGP is enabled on that interface.

{{%notice note%}}

IPv6 route advertisements (RAs) are automatically enabled on an
interface with IPv6 addresses; the `no ipv6 nd suppress-ra` command is
not needed for BGP unnumbered.

Use `vtysh` to verify the configuration:

## Enable Read-only Mode

As BGP peers are established and updates are received, prefixes might be
installed in the RIB and advertised to BGP peers even though the
information from all peers has not yet been received and processed.
Depending on the timing of the updates, prefixes might be installed and
propagated through BGP, and then immediately withdrawn and replaced with
new routing information. Read-only mode minimizes this BGP route churn
in both the local RIB and with BGP peers.

Enable read-only mode to reduce CPU and network usage when you restart
the BGP process, or when you issue the `clear` `ip bgp` command. Because
intermediate best paths are possible for the same prefix as peers get
established and start receiving updates at different times, read-only
mode is particularly useful in topologies where BGP learns a prefix from
many peers and the network has a high number of prefixes.

To enable read-only mode, run the `net add bgp update-delay <max-delay
in 0-3600 seconds> [<establish-wait in 1-3600 seconds>]` command.  
The following example command enables read-only mode, sets the
`max-delay` timer to 300 seconds and the `establish-wait` timer to 90
seconds.

    cumulus@switch:$ net add bgp update-delay 300 90

{{%notice note%}}

The default value for max-delay is 0, which disables read-only mode.  
The `establish-wait` option is optional; however, if specified, the
`establish-wait` option must be shorter than the `max-delay`.

{{%/notice%}}

Read-only mode begins as soon as the first peer reaches its established
state and the `max-delay` timer starts, and continues until either of
the following two conditions are met:

  - All the configured peers (except the shutdown peers) have sent an
    explicit EOR (End-Of-RIB) or an implicit EOR. The first keep-alive
    after BGP has reached the established state is considered an
    implicit EOR.  
    If you specify the `establish-wait` option, BGP only considers peers
    that have reached the established state from the moment the
    `max-delay` timer starts until the `establish-wait` period ends.

    {{%notice note%}}

The minimum set of established peers for which EOR is expected are
    the peers that are established during the `establish-wait window,`
    not necessarily all the configured neighbors.

    {{%/notice%}}

  - The timer reaches the configured `max-delay`.

While in read-only mode, BGP does not run best-path or generate any
updates to its peers.

To show information about the state of the update delay, run the `show
bgp summary` command.

## Apply a Route Map for Route Updates

There are two ways you can apply [route maps](http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/routemap.html)
for BGP:

  - By filtering routes from BGP into Zebra
  - By filtering routes from Zebra into the Linux kernel

### Filter Routes from BGP into Zebra

You can apply a route map on route updates from BGP to Zebra. All the
applicable match operations are allowed, such as match on prefix, next
hop, communities, and so on. Set operations for this attach-point are
limited to metric and next hop only. Any operation of this feature does
not affect BGPs internal RIB.

Both IPv4 and IPv6 address families are supported. Route maps work on
multi-paths; however, the metric setting is based on the best path only.

To apply a route map to filter route updates from BGP into Zebra, run
the following command:

    cumulus@switch:$ net add bgp table-map <route-map-name>

### Filter Routes from Zebra into the Linux Kernel

To apply a route map to filter route updates from Zebra into the Linux
kernel, run the following command:

    cumulus@switch:$ net add routing protocol bgp route-map <route-map-name>

## Protocol Tuning

### Converge Quickly On Link Failures

In the Clos topology, we recommend that you only use interface addresses
to set up peering sessions. This means that when the link fails, the BGP
session is torn down immediately, triggering route updates to propagate
through the network quickly. This requires the following commands be
enabled for all links: `link-detect` and `ttl-security hops <hops>`.
`ttl-security hops` specifies how many hops away the neighbor is. For
example, in a Clos topology, every peer is at most 1 hop away.

{{%notice note%}}

See Caveats and Errata below for information regarding `ttl-security
hops`.

{{%/notice%}}

Here is an example:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor 10.0.0.2 ttl-security hops 1


### Converge Quickly On Soft Failures

It is possible that the link is up but the neighboring BGP process is
hung or has crashed. If a BGP process hangs or crashes, the FRRouting
`watchfrr` daemon, which monitors the various FRRouting daemons,
attempts to restart it. BGP itself has a keepalive interval that is
exchanged between neighbors. By default, this keepalive interval is set
to 3 seconds. You can increase the interval to a higher number, which
decreases CPU load, especially in the presence of a lot of neighbors.
The keepalive interval is the periodicity with which the keepalive
message is sent. The hold time specifies how many keepalive messages can
be lost before the connection is considered invalid. It is usually set
to three times the keepalive time and defaults to 9 seconds. The
following example shows how to change these timers:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp51 timers 10 30

The following snippet shows that the default values have been modified
for this neighbor:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show bgp neighbor swp51
    BGP neighbor on swp51: fe80::4638:39ff:fe00:5c, remote AS 65020, local AS 65011, external link
    Hostname: spine01
     Member of peer-group fabric for session parameters
      BGP version 4, remote router ID 0.0.0.0
      BGP state = Connect
      Last read 00:00:13, Last write 00:39:43
      Hold time is 30, keepalive interval is 10 seconds
      Configured hold time is 30, keepalive interval is 10 seconds
    ...

### Reconnect Quickly

A BGP process attempts to connect to a peer after a failure (or on
startup) every `connect-time` seconds. By default, this is 10 seconds.
To modify this value, run the following command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp51 timers connect 30

You must specify this command for each neighbor.

### Advertisement Interval

BGP by default chooses stability over fast convergence. This is very
useful when routing for the Internet. For example, unlike link-state
protocols, BGP typically waits for a duration of
`advertisement-interval` seconds between sending consecutive updates to
a neighbor. This ensures that an unstable neighbor flapping routes are
not propagated throughout the network. By default, this is set to zero
seconds for both eBGP and iBGP sessions, which allows for very fast
convergence. You can modify this as follows:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bgp neighbor swp51 advertisement-interval 5

The following output shows the modified value:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show bgp neighbor swp51

## Caveats and Errata

### ttl-security Issue

Enabling `ttl-security` does not cause the hardware to be programmed
with the relevant information. This means that frames will come up to
the CPU and be dropped there. It is recommended that you use the `net
add acl` command to explicitly add the relevant entry to hardware.

For example, you can configure a file, such as
`/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01control_plane_bgp.rules`, with a rule like
this for TTL:

    INGRESS_INTF = swp1
        INGRESS_CHAIN = INPUT, FORWARD
    Â 
        [iptables]
        -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --dport bgp -m ttl --ttl 255 POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 1000
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --dport bgp DROP

### BGP Dynamic Capabilities not Supported

Dynamic capabilities, which enable BGP to renegotiate a new feature for
an already established peer, are not supported in Cumulus Linux.
