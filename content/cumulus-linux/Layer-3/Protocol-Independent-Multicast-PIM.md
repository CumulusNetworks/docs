Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a multicast control plane
protocol that advertises multicast sources and receivers over a routed
layer 3 network. Layer 3 multicast relies on PIM to advertise
information about multicast capable routers, and the location of
multicast senders and receivers. For this reason, multicast cannot be
sent through a routed network without PIM.

PIM has two modes of operation: Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Dense Mode
(PIM-DM).

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux supports only PIM Sparse Mode.

### PIM Neighbors

When PIM is configured on an interface, `PIM Hello` messages are sent to
the link local multicast group 224.0.0.13. Any other router configured
with PIM on the segment that hears the PIM Hello messages build a PIM
neighbor with the sending device.

{{%notice note%}}

PIM neighbors are stateless. No confirmation of neighbor relationship is
exchanged between PIM endpoints.

{{%/notice%}}

## PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)

PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is a *pull* multicast distribution method;
multicast traffic is only sent through the network if receivers
explicitly ask for it. When a receiver *pulls* multicast traffic, the
network must be periodically notified that the receiver wants to
continue the multicast stream.

{{%notice note%}}

This behavior is in contrast to PIM Dense Mode (PIM-DM), where traffic
is flooded, and the network must be periodically notified that the
receiver wants to stop receiving the multicast stream.

{{%/notice%}}

PIM-SM has three configuration options: Any-source Multicast (ASM),
Bi-directional Multicast (BiDir), and Source Specific Multicast (SSM):

  - Any-source Mulitcast (ASM) is the traditional, and most commonly
    deployed PIM implementation. ASM relies on rendezvous points to
    connect multicast senders and receivers that then dynamically
    determine the shortest path through the network between source and
    receiver, to efficiently send multicast traffic.

  - Bidirectional PIM (BiDir) forwards all traffic through the multicast
    rendezvous point (RP) instead of tracking multicast source IPs,
    allowing for greater scale while resulting in inefficient forwarding
    of network traffic.

  - Source Specific Multicast (SSM) requires multicast receivers to know
    exactly from which source they want to receive multicast traffic
    instead of relying on multicast rendezvous points. SSM requires the
    use of IGMPv3 on the multicast clients.

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux only supports ASM and SSM. PIM BiDir is not currently
supported.

{{%/notice%}}

For additional information, see
[RFC 7761 - Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7761).

### Any-source Multicast Routing

Multicast routing behaves differently depending on whether the source is
sending before receivers request the multicast stream, or if a receiver
tries to join a stream before there are any sources.

#### Receiver Joins First

When a receiver joins a group, an IGMP membership join message is sent
to the IGMPv3 multicast group, 224.0.0.22. The PIM multicast router for
the segment that is listening to the IGMPv3 group receives the IGMP
membership join message and becomes an LHR for this group.

{{% imgOld 2 %}}

This creates a (\*,G) mroute with an OIF of the interface on which the
IGMP Membership Report is received and an IIF of the RPF interface for
the RP.

The LHR generates a PIM (\*,G) join message and sends it from the
interface towards the RP. Each multicast router between the LHR and the
RP builds a (\*,G) mroute with the OIF being the interface on which the
PIM join message is received and an Incoming Interface of the reverse
path forwarding interface for the RP.

{{% imgOld 3 %}}

{{%notice note%}}

When the RP receives the (\*,G) Join message, it does not send any
additional PIM join messages. The RP will maintain a (\*,G) state as
long as the receiver wishes to receive the multicast group.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice note%}}

Unlike multicast receivers, multicast sources do not send IGMP (or PIM)
messages to the FHR. A multicast source begins sending, and the FHR
receives the traffic and builds both a (\*,G) and an (S,G) mroute. The
FHR then begins the PIM register process.

{{%/notice%}}

##### PIM Register Process

When a first hop router (FHR) receives a multicast data packet from a
source, the FHR does not know if there are any interested multicast
receivers in the network. The FHR encapsulates the data packet in a
unicast PIM register message. This packet is sourced from the FHR and
destined to the RP address. The RP builds an (S,G) mroute, decapsulates
the multicast packet, and forwards it along the (\*,G) tree.

As the unencapsulated multicast packet travels down the (\*,G) tree
towards the interested receivers, at the same time, the RP sends a PIM
(S,G) join towards the FHR. This builds an (S,G) state on each multicast
router between the RP and FHR.

When the FHR receives a PIM (S,G) join, it continues encapsulating and
sending PIM register messages, but also makes a copy of the packet and
sends it along the (S,G) mroute.

The RP then receives the multicast packet along the (S,G) tree and sends
a PIM register stop to the FHR to end the register process.

{{% imgOld 4 %}}

{{% imgOld 5 %}}

##### PIM SPT Switchover

When the LHR receives the first multicast packet, it sends a PIM (S,G)
join towards the FHR to efficiently forward traffic through the network.
This builds the shortest path tree (SPT), or the tree that is the
shortest path to the source.

When the traffic arrives over the SPT, a PIM (S,G) RPT prune is sent up
the shared tree towards the RP. This removes multicast traffic from the
shared tree; multicast data is only sent over the SPT.

SPT switchover can be configured on a per-group basis, allowing for some
groups to never switch to a shortest path tree; this is also called *SPT
infinity*.

The LHR now sends both (\*,G) joins and (S,G) RPT prune messages towards
the RP.

To configure a group to never follow the SPT, complete the following
steps:

1.  Create the necessary prefix-lists using the FRRouting CLI:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
        switch# configure terminal
        switch(config)# ip prefix-list spt-range permit 235.0.0.0/8 ge 32
        switch(config)# ip prefix-list spt-range permit 238.0.0.0/8 ge 32

2.  Configure SPT switchover for the *spt-range* prefix-list:

        switch(config)# ip pim spt-switchover infinity prefix-list spt-range

You can view the configured prefix-list with the `net show mroute`
command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show mroute
    Source          Group           Proto  Input      Output     TTL  Uptime
    *               235.0.0.0       IGMP   swp31s0    pimreg     1    00:03:3
                                    IGMP              br1        1    00:03:38
    *               238.0.0.0       IGMP   swp31s0    br1        1    00:02:08

In the example above, *235.0.0.0* is configured for SPT switchover,
identified by *pimreg*.

#### Sender Starts Before Receivers Join

A multicast sender can send multicast data without any additional IGMP
or PIM signaling. When the FHR receives the multicast traffic, it
encapsulates it and sends a PIM register to the rendezvous point (RP).

When the RP receives the PIM register, it builds an (S,G) mroute;
however, there is no (\*,G) mroute and no interested receivers.

The RP drops the PIM register message and immediately sends a PIM
register stop message to the FHR.

Receiving a PIM register stop without any associated PIM joins leaves
the FHR without any outgoing interfaces. The FHR drops this multicast
traffic until a PIM join is received.

{{%notice note%}}

PIM register messages are sourced from the interface that receives the
multicast traffic and are destined to the RP address. The PIM register
is not sourced from the interface towards the RP.

{{%/notice%}}

### PIM Null-Register

To notify the RP that multicast traffic is still flowing when the RP has
no receiver, or if the RP is not on the SPT tree, the FHR periodically
sends PIM null register messages. The FHR sends a PIM register with the
Null-Register flag set, but without any data. This special PIM register
notifies the RP that a multicast source is still sending, in case any
new receivers come online.

After receiving a PIM Null-Register, the RP immediately sends a PIM
register stop to acknowledge the reception of the PIM null register
message.

### PIM and ECMP

PIM uses the RPF procedure to choose an upstream interface to build a
forwarding state. If equal-cost multipaths (ECMP) are configured, PIM
can use choose the RPF based on ECMP using hash algorithms.

The FRR `ip pim ecmp` command enables PIM to use all the available
nexthops for the installation of mroutes. For example, if you have
four-way ECMP, PIM spreads the S,G and \*,G mroutes across the four
different paths.

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
    switch# configure terminal
    switch(config)# ip pim ecmp

The `ip pim ecmp rebalance` command recalculates all stream paths in the
event of a loss of path over one of the ECMP paths. Without this
command, only the streams that are using the path that is lost are moved
to alternate ECMP paths. Rebalance does not affect existing groups.

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
    switch# configure terminal
    switch(config)# ip pim ecmp rebalance

{{%notice warning%}}

The rebalance command can cause some packet loss.

{{%/notice%}}

The `show ip pim nexthop` provides you with a way to review which
nexthop is selected for a specific source/group:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
    switch# show ip pim nexthop
    Number of registered addresses: 3
    Address         Interface      Nexthop
    -------------------------------------------
    6.0.0.9         swp31s0        169.254.0.9
    6.0.0.9         swp31s1        169.254.0.25
    6.0.0.11        lo             0.0.0.0
    6.0.0.10        swp31s0        169.254.0.9
    6.0.0.10        swp31s1        169.254.0.25

## Configure PIM

To configure PIM using NCLU:

1.  Configure the PIM interface:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp1 pim sm

    {{%notice note%}}

PIM must be enabled on all interfaces facing multicast sources or
    multicast receivers, as well as on the interface where the RP
    address is configured.

    {{%/notice%}}

2.  **Optional:** Run the following command to enable IGMP (either
    version 2 or 3) on the interfaces with hosts attached. IGMP version
    3 is the default, so you only need to specify the version if you
    want to use IGMP version 2:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp1 igmp version 2

    {{%notice note%}}

You must configure IGMP on all interfaces where multicast receivers
    exist.

    {{%/notice%}}

3.  Configure a group mapping for a static RP:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add pim rp 192.168.0.1

    {{%notice note%}}

Unless you are using PIM SSM, each PIM-SM enabled device must
    configure a static RP to a group mapping, and all PIM-SM enabled
    devices must have the same RP to group mapping configuration.

    IP PIM RP group ranges can overlap. Cumulus Linux performs a longest
    prefix match (LPM) to determine the RP. For example:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add pim rp 192.168.0.1 224.10.0.0/16
        cumulus@switch:~$ net add pim rp 192.168.0.2 224.10.2.0/24

    In this example, if the group is in 224.10.2.5, the RP that gets
    selected is 192.168.0.2. If the group is 224.10.15, the RP that gets
    selected is 192.168.0.1.

    {{%/notice%}}

4.  Review and commit your changes:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
        cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

### Configure PIM Using FRRouting

PIM is included in the FRRouting package. For proper PIM operation, PIM
depends on Zebra. PIM relies on unicast routing to be configured and
operational to do RPF operations. Therefore, you must configure some
other routing protocol or static routes.

To configure PIM on a switch using FRR:

1.  Open the `/etc/frr/daemons` file in a text editor.

2.  Add the following line to the end of the file to enable `pimd`, then
    save the file:

        zebra=yes
        pimd=yes

3.  Run the `systemctl restart` command to restart FRRouting:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart frr

4.  In a terminal, run the `vtysh` command to start the FRRouting CLI on
    the switch.

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
        cumulus#

5.  Run the following commands to configure the PIM interfaces:

        cumulus# configure terminal
        cumulus(config)# int swp1
        cumulus(config-if)# ip pim sm

    {{%notice note%}}

PIM must be enabled on all interfaces facing multicast sources or
    multicast receivers, as well as on the interface where the RP
    address is configured.

    {{%/notice%}}

6.  **Optional:** Run the following commands to enable IGMP (either
    version 2 or 3) on the interfaces with hosts attached. IGMP version
    3 is the default; you only need to specify the version if you want
    to use IGMP version 2:

        cumulus# configure terminal
        cumulus(config)# int swp1Â 
        cumulus(config-if)# ip igmp
        cumulus(config-if)# ip igmp version 2 #skip this step if you are using version 3

    {{%notice note%}}

You must configure IGMP on all interfaces where multicast receivers
    exist.

    {{%/notice%}}

7.  Configure a group mapping for a static RP:

        cumulus# configure terminal
        cumulus(config)# ip pim rp 192.168.0.1

    {{%notice note%}}

Each PIM-SM enabled device must configure a static RP to a group
    mapping, and all PIM-SM enabled devices must have the same RP to
    group mapping configuration.

    IP PIM RP group ranges can overlap. Cumulus Linux performs a longest
    prefix match (LPM) to determine the RP. For example:

        cumulus(config)# ip pim rp 10.0.0.13 224.10.0.0/16

    {{%/notice%}}

## Source Specific Multicast Mode (SSM)

The source-specific multicast method uses prefix-lists to configure a
receiver to only allow traffic to a multicast address from a single
source. This removes the need for an RP, as the source must be known
before traffic can be accepted. The default range is `232.0.0.0/8`, and
must be further configured by setting a prefix-list.

The example process below configures a prefix-list named `ssm-range`,
and prefix-lists permitting traffic from `230.0.0.0/8` and
`238.0.0.0/8,` for prefixes longer than 32.

{{%notice warning%}}

PIM considers `232.0.0.0/8` the default range if the ssm range is not
configured. If this default is overridden with a prefix-list, **all**
ranges that should be considered must be in the prefix-list

{{%/notice%}}

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add pim prefix-list ipv4 ssm range permit 232.0.0.0/8 ge 32
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add pim prefix-list ipv4 ssm range permit 238.0.0.0/8 ge 32
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add pim prefix-list ipv4 ssm range permit
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add pim ssm prefix-list ssm-range
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

You can also perform this configuration with the FRRouting CLI:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtysh
    switch# conf t
    switch(config)# ip prefix-list ssm-range seq 5 permit 232.0.0.0/8 ge 32
    switch(config)# ip prefix-list ssm-range seq 10 permit 238.0.0.0/8 ge 32
    switch(config)# ip pim ssm prefix-list ssm-range
    switch(config)# exit
    switch# write mem

To view the existing prefix-lists, run the `net show ip` command:

    cumulus@switch:~S net show ip prefix-list ssm-range
    ZEBRA: ip prefix-list ssm-range: 2 entries
        seq 5 permit 232.0.0.0/8 ge 32
        seq 10 permit 238.0.0.0/8 ge 32
    OSPF: ip prefix-list ssm-range: 2 entries
        seq 5 permit 232.0.0.0/8 ge 32
        seq 10 permit 238.0.0.0/8 ge 32
    PIM: ip prefix-list ssm-range: 2 entries
        seq 5 permit 232.0.0.0/8 ge 32
        seq 10 permit 238.0.0.0/8 ge 32

## IP Multicast Boundaries

Multicast boundaries enable you to limit the distribution of multicast
traffic by setting boundaries with the goal of pushing multicast to a
subset of the network.

With such boundaries in place, any incoming IGMP or PIM joins are
dropped or accepted based upon the prefix-list specified. The boundary
is implemented by applying an IP multicast boundary OIL (outgoing
interface list) on an interface.

To configure the boundary, use NCLU:

1.  Create a prefix-list as above.

2.  Configure the IP multicast boundary:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add <interface> multicast boundary oil <prefix-list>
        cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
        cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

## Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)

You can use the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) to connect
multiple PIM-SM multicast domains together, using the PIM-SM RPs. By
configuring any cast RPs with the same IP address on multiple multicast
switches (primarily on the loopback interface), the PIM-SM limitation of
only one RP per multicast group is relaxed. This allows for an increase
in both failover and load-balancing throughout.

When an RP discovers a new source (typically a PIM-SM register message),
a source-active (SA) message is sent to each MSDP peer. The peer then
determines if any receivers are interested.

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux MSDP support is primarily for anycast-RP configuration,
rather than multiple multicast domains. You must configure each MSDP
peer in a full mesh, as SA messages are not received and re-forwarded.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux currently only supports one MSDP mesh-group.

{{%/notice%}}

The following steps demonstrate how to configure a Cumulus switch to use
the MSDP:

1.  Add an anycast IP address to the loopback interface for each RP in
    the domain:

        cumulus@rp01:~$ net add loopback lo ip address 10.1.1.1/32
        cumulus@rp01:~$ net add loopback lo ip address 10.1.1.100/32

2.  On every multicast switch, configure the group to RP mapping using
    the anycast address:

        cumulus@switch:$ net add pim rp 100.1.1.100 224.0.0.0/4
        cumulus@switch:$ net pending
        cumulus@switch:$ net commit

3.  Configure the MSDP mesh group for all active RPs (the following
    example uses 3 RPs):

     {{%notice note%}}

The mesh group must include all RPs in the domain as members, with a unique address as the source. This configuration results in MSDP peerings between all RPs.

{{%/notice%}}

        cumulus@rp01:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus member 100.1.1.2
        cumulus@rp01:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus member 100.1.1.3

        cumulus@rp02:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus member 100.1.1.1
        cumulus@rp02:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus member 100.1.1.3

        cumulus@rp03:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus member 100.1.1.1
        cumulus@rp03:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus member 100.1.1.2

4.  Pick the local loopback address as the source of the MSDP control
    packets:

        cumulus@rp01:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus source 100.1.1.1

        cumulus@rp02:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus source 100.1.1.2

        cumulus@rp03:$ net add msdp mesh-group cumulus source 100.1.1.3

5.  Inject the anycast IP address into the IGP of the domain.

{{%notice note%}}

If the network is unnumbered and uses unnumbered BGP as the IGP, avoid
using the anycast IP address for establishing unicast or multicast
peerings. For PIM-SM, ensure that the unique address is used as the PIM
hello source by setting the source:

    cumulus@rp01:$ net add loopback lo pim use-source 100.1.1.1

### Source Starts First

On the FHR, an mroute is built, but the upstream state is *Prune*. The
FHR flag is set on the interface receiving multicast.

Use the `net show mroute` command (or `show ip mroute` in FRR) to review
detailed output for the FHR:

## PIM in a VRF

[VRFs](../Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF/)
divide the routing table on a per-tenant basis, ultimately providing for
separate layer 3 networks over a single layer 3 infrastructure. With a
VRF, each tenant has its own virtualized layer 3 network, so IP
addresses can overlap between tenants.

PIM in a VRF enables PIM trees and multicast data traffic to run inside
a layer 3 virtualized network, with a separate tree per domain or
tenant. Each VRF has its own multicast tree with its own RP(s), sources,
and so on. Therefore, you can have one tenant per corporate division,
client, or product; for example.

VRFs on different switches typically connect or are peered over
subinterfaces, where each subinterface is in its own VRF, provided
MP-BGP VPN is not enabled or supported.

To configure PIM in a VRF, run the following commands. First, add the
VRFs and associate them with switch ports:

    cumulus@rp01:~$ net add vrf blue
    cumulus@rp01:~$ net add vrf purple
    cumulus@rp01:~$ net add interface swp1 vrf blue
    cumulus@rp01:~$ net add interface swp2 vrf purple

Then add the PIM configuration to FRR, review and commit the changes:

    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add interface swp1 pim sm
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add interface swp2 pim sm
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add bgp vrf blue auto 65001
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add bgp vrf purple auto 65000
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add bgp vrf blue router-id 10.1.1.1
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add bgp vrf purple router-id 10.1.1.2
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add bgp vrf blue neighbor swp1 interface remote-as external
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net add bgp vrf purple neighbor swp2 interface remote-as external
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net pending
    cumulus@fhr:~$ net commit

These commands create the following configuration in the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file and the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file:

## BFD for PIM Neighbors

You can use [bidirectional forward
detection](../Bidirectional-Forwarding-Detection-BFD/)
(BFD) for PIM neighbors to quickly detect link failures. When you
configure an interface, include the `pim bfd` option:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp31s3 pim bfd
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

## Troubleshooting

### FHR Stuck in Registering Process

When a multicast source starts, the FHR sends unicast PIM register
messages from the RPF interface towards the source. After the PIM
register is received by the RP, a `PIM register stop` message is sent
from the RP to the FHR to end the register process. If an issue occurs
with this communication, the FHR becomes stuck in the registering
process, which can result in high CPU, as PIM register packets are
generated by the FHR CPU and sent to the RP CPU.

To assess this issue:

  - Review the FHR. The output interface of `pimreg` can be seen here.
    If this does not change to an interface within a few seconds, the
    FHR is likely stuck.

        cumulus@fhr:~$ net show mroute
        Source          Group           Proto  Input      Output     TTL  Uptime
        172.16.5.105    239.2.2.3       PIM    br0        pimreg     1    00:03:59

To troubleshoot the issue:

1.  Validate that the FHR can reach the RP. If the RP and FHR can not
    communicate, the registration process fails:

        cumulus@fhr:~$ ping 10.0.0.21 -I br0
        PING 10.0.0.21 (10.0.0.21) from 172.16.5.1 br0: 56(84) bytes of data.
        ^C
        --- 10.0.0.21 ping statistics ---
        4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3000ms

2.  On the RP, use `tcpdump` to see if the PIM register packets are
    arriving:

        cumulus@rp01:~$ sudo tcpdump -i swp30
        tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
        listening on swp30, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
        23:33:17.524982 IP 172.16.5.1 > 10.0.0.21: PIMv2, Register, length 66

3.  If PIM registration packets are being received, verify that they are
    seen by PIM by issuing `debug pim packets` from within FRRouting:

        cumulus@fhr:~$ sudo vtysh -c "debug pim packets"
        PIM Packet debugging is on
        Â 
        cumulus@rp01:~$ sudo tail /var/log/frr/frr.log
        2016/10/19 23:46:51 PIM: Recv PIM REGISTER packet from 172.16.5.1 to 10.0.0.21 on swp30: ttl=255 pim_version=2 pim_msg_size=64 checksum=a681

4.  Repeat the process on the FHR to see if PIM register stop messages
    are being received on the FHR and passed to the PIM process:

        cumulus@fhr:~$ sudo tcpdump -i swp51
        23:58:59.841625 IP 172.16.5.1 > 10.0.0.21: PIMv2, Register, length 28
        23:58:59.842466 IP 10.0.0.21 > 172.16.5.1: PIMv2, Register Stop, length 18
        Â 
        cumulus@fhr:~$ sudo vtysh -c "debug pim packets"
        PIM Packet debugging is on
        Â 
        cumulus@fhr:~$ sudo tail -f /var/log/frr/frr.log
        2016/10/19 23:59:38 PIM: Recv PIM REGSTOP packet from 10.0.0.21 to 172.16.5.1 on swp51: ttl=255 pim_version=2 pim_msg_size=18 checksum=5a39

### No \*,G Is Built on LHR

The most common reason for a \*,G to not be built on an LHR is for if
both PIM **and** IGMP are not enabled on an interface facing a receiver.

    lhr# show run
    !
    interface br0
     ip igmp
     ip ospf area 0.0.0.0
     ip pim sm

To troubleshoot this issue, if both PIM and IGMP are enabled, ensure
that IGMPv3 joins are being sent by the receiver:

    cumulus@lhr:~$ sudo tcpdump -i br0 igmp
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on br0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
    00:03:55.789744 IP 172.16.1.101 > igmp.mcast.net: igmp v3 report, 1 group record(s)

### No mroute Created on FHR

To troubleshoot this issue:

1.  Verify that multicast traffic is being received:

        cumulus@fhr:~$ sudo tcpdump -i br0
        tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
        listening on br0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
        00:11:52.944745 IP 172.16.5.105.51570 > 239.2.2.9.1000: UDP, length 9

2.  Verify that PIM is configured on the interface facing the source:

        fhr# show run
        !
        interface br0
         ip ospf area 0.0.0.0
         ip pim sm

3.  If PIM is configured, verify that the RPF interface for the source
    matches the interface on which the multicast traffic is received:

        fhr# show ip rpf 172.16.5.105
        Routing entry for 172.16.5.0/24 using Multicast RIB
          Known via "connected", distance 0, metric 0, best
          * directly connected, br0

4.  Verify that an RP is configured for the multicast group:

        fhr# show ip pim rp-info
        RP address       group/prefix-list   OIF         I am RP
        10.0.0.21        224.0.0.0/4         swp51       no

### No S,G on RP for an Active Group

An RP does not build an mroute when there are no active receivers for a
multicast group, even though the mroute was created on the FHR:

    cumulus@rp01:~$ net show mroute
    Source          Group           Proto  Input      Output     TTL  Uptime
    spine01#

    cumulus@rp01:~$ net show mroute
    Source          Group           Proto  Input      Output     TTL  Uptime
    172.16.5.105    239.2.2.9       none   br0        none       0    --:--:--

This is expected behavior. You can see the active source on the RP with
the `show ip pim upstream` command:

    cumulus@rp01:~$ net show pim upstream
    Iif       Source          Group           State       Uptime   JoinTimer RSTimer   KATimer   RefCnt
    swp30     172.16.5.105    239.2.2.9       Prune       00:08:03 --:--:--  --:--:--  00:02:20       1
    !
    cumulus@rp01:~$ net show mroute
    Source          Group           Proto  Input      Output     TTL  Uptime

### No mroute Entry Present in Hardware

Use the `cl-resource-query` command to verify that the hardware IP
multicast entry is the maximum value:

    cumulus@switch:~$ cl-resource-query  | grep Mcast
       Total Mcast Routes:         450,   0% of maximum value    450

For Spectrum chipsets, refer to
[TCAM Resource Profiles for Spectrum Switches](../Routing/#tcam-resource-profiles-for-spectrum-switches).

### Verify MSDP Session State

Run the following commands to verify the state of MSDP sessions:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show msdp mesh-group
    Mesh group : pod1
      Source : 100.1.1.1
      Member                 State
      100.1.1.2        established
      100.1.1.3        established
    cumulus@switch:~$
    cumulus@switch:~$ net show msdp peer       
    Peer                       Local        State    Uptime   SaCnt
    100.1.1.2              100.1.1.1  established  00:07:21       0
    100.1.1.3              100.1.1.1  established  00:07:21       0

### View the Active Sources

Review the active sources learned locally (through PIM registers) and
from MSDP peers:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show msdp sa   
    Source                     Group               RP  Local  SPT    Uptime
    44.1.11.2              239.1.1.1        100.1.1.1      n    n  00:00:40
    44.1.11.2              239.1.1.2        100.1.1.1      n    n  00:00:25

## Caveats and Errata

  - Cumulus Linux only supports *PIM sparse mode* (PIM-SM), *any-source
    multicast* (PIM-SM ASM), and *source-specific multicast* (SSM).
    *Dense mode* and *bidirectional multicast* are not supported.
  - Non-native forwarding (register decapsulation) is not supported.
    Initial packet loss is expected while the PIM \*,G tree is built
    from the rendezvous point to the FHR to trigger native forwarding.
  - Cumulus Linux does not currently build an S,G mroute when forwarding
    over an \*,G tree.
