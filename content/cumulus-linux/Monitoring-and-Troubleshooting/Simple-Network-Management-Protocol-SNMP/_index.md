Cumulus Linux uses the open source Net-SNMP agent `snmpd`, version 5.7,
which provides support for most of the common industry+wide MIBs,
including interface counters and TCP/UDP IP stack data.

## History

SNMP is an IETF standards-based network management architecture and
protocol that traces its roots back to Carnegie-Mellon University in
1982. Since then, it has been modified by programmers at the University
of California. In 1995, this code was also made publicly available as
the UCD project. After that, `ucd-snmp` was extended by work done at the
University of Liverpool as well as later in Denmark. In late 2000, the
project name changed to `net-snmp` and became a fully-fledged
collaborative open source project. The version used by Cumulus Networks
is based on the latest `net-snmp` 5.7 branch with added custom MIBs and
pass-through and pass-persist scripts ([see below](#pass-persist-scripts)
for more information on pass persist scripts).

## Introduction to Simple Network Management Protocol

SNMP Management servers gather information from different systems in a
consistent manner and the paths to the relevant information are
standardized in IETF RFCs. SNMPs longevity is due to the fact that it
standardizes the objects collected from devices, the protocol used for
transport, and architecture of the management systems. The most widely
used, and most insecure, versions of SNMP are versions 1 and 2c and
their popularity is largely due to implementations that have been in use
for decades. SNMP version 3 is the recommended version because of its
advanced security features. In general, a network being profiled by SNMP
Management Stations mainly consist of devices containing SNMP agents.
The agent running on Cumulus Linux switches and routers is the `snmpd`
daemon.

### SNMP Managers

An SNMP Network Management System (NMS) is a computer that is configured
to poll SNMP agents (in this case, Cumulus Linux switches and routers)
to gather information and present it. This manager can be any machine
that can send query requests to SNMP agents with the correct
credentials. This NMS can be a large set of monitoring suite or as
simple as some scripts that collect and display data. The managers
generally poll the agents and the agents respond with the data. There
are a variety of polling command-line tools (snmpget, snmpgetnext,
snmpwalk, snmpbulkget, snmpbulkwalk, and so on). SNMP agents can also
send unsolicited Traps/Inform messages to the SNMP Manager based on
predefined criteria (like link changes).

### SNMP Agents

The SNMP agents (`snmpd`) running on the switches do the bulk of the
work and are responsible for gathering information about the local
system and storing data in a format that can be queried updating an
internal database called the *management information base*, or MIB. The
MIB is a standardized, hierarchical structure that stores information
that can be queried. Parts of the MIB tree are available and provided to
incoming requests originating from an NMS host that has authenticated
with the correct credentials. You can configure the Cumulus Linux switch
with usernames and credentials to provide authenticated and encrypted
responses to NMS requests. The `snmpd` agent can also proxy requests and
act as a *master agent* to sub-agents running on other daemons (FRR,
LLDP).

### Management Information Base (MIB)

The MIB is a database that is implemented on the daemon (or agent) and
follows IETF RFC standards to which the manager and agents adhere. It is
a hierarchical structure that, in many areas, is globally standardized,
but also flexible enough to allow vendor-specific additions. Cumulus
Networks implements a number of custom enterprise MIB tables and these
are defined in text files located on the switch and in files named
`/usr/share/snmp/mibs/Cumulus*`. The MIB structure is best understood as
a top-down hierarchical tree. Each branch that forks off is labeled with
both an identifying number (starting with 1) and an identifying string
that is unique for that level of the hierarchy. These strings and
numbers can be used interchangeably. A specific node of the tree can be
traced from the unnamed root of the tree to the node in question. The
parent IDs (numbers or strings) are strung together, starting with the
most general to form an address for the MIB Object. Each junction in the
hierarchy is represented by a dot in this notation so that the address
ends up being a series of ID strings or numbers separated by dots. This
entire address is known as an object identifier (OID).

Hardware vendors that embed SNMP agents in their devices sometimes
implement custom branches with their own fields and data points.
However, there are standard MIB branches that are well defined and can
be used by any device. The standard branches discussed here are all
under the same parent branch structure. This branch defines information
that adheres to the MIB-2 specification, which is a revised standard for
compliant devices. You can use various online and command-line tools to
translate between numbers and string and to also provide definitions for
the various MIB Objects. For example, you can view the `sysLocation`
object in the system table with either a string of numbers
**1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6** or the string representation
**iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysLocation.** You can view the
definition with the snmptranslate (1) command (found in the `snmp`
Debian package).

The section ` 1.3.6.1  `or `iso.org.dod.internet` is the OID that
defines internet resources. The`  2  `or`  mgmt  `that follows is for a
management subcategory. The `1` or `mib-2` under that defines the MIB-2
specification. And finally, the 1 or system is the parent for a number
of child objects (sysDescr, sysObjectID, sysUpTime, sysContact, sysName,
sysLocation, sysServices, and so on).

## Getting Started

The simplest use case for using SNMP consists of creating a readonly
community password and enabling a listening address for the loopback
address (this is the default listening-address provided). This allows
for testing functionality of `snmpd` before extending the listening
addresses to IP addresses reachable from outside the switch or router.
This first sample configuration adds a listening address on the loopback
interface (this is not a change from the default so we get a message
stating that the configuration has not changed), sets a simple community
password (SNMPv2) for testing, changes the system-name object in the
system table, commits the change, checks the status of `snmpd`, and gets
the first MIB object in the system table:

    cumulus@router1:~$ net add snmp-server listening-address localhost
    Configuration has not changed
    cumulus@router1:~$ net add snmp-server readonly-community mynotsosecretpassword access any
    cumulus@router1:~$ net add snmp-server system-name my little router
    cumulus@router1:~$ net commit

    cumulus@router1:~$ net show snmp-server status

## Configure SNMP

For external SNMP NMS systems to poll Cumulus Linux switches and
routers, you must configure the SNMP agent (snmpd) running on the switch
with one or more IP addresses (with `net add snmp-server
listening-address <ip>`) on which the agent listens. You must configure
these IP addresses on interfaces that have link state UP. By default,
the SNMP configuration has a listening address of localhost (or
127.0.0.1), which allows the daemon to respond to SNMP requests
originating on the switch itself. This is a useful method of checking
the configuration for SNMP without exposing the switch to attacks from
the outside. The only other required configuration is a readonly
community password (configured with `net add snmp-server
readonly-community <password> access <ip | any>``)`, that allows polling
of the various MIB objects on the device itself. SNMPv3 is recommended
since SNMPv2c (with a community string) exposes the password in the
`GetRequest` and `GetResponse` packets. SNMPv3 does not expose the
username passwords and has the option of encrypting the packet contents.

If you intend to run this service within a
[VRF](../../Layer-3/Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF/),
including the [management VRF](../../Layer-3/Management-VRF/), follow
[these steps](../../Layer-3/Management-VRF/#run-services-within-the-management-vrf)
for configuring the service.

Cumulus Linux 3.4 and later releases support configuring SNMP with NCLU.
While NCLU does not provide functionality to configure every single
`snmpd` feature, it is the recommended method of configuring `snmpd`.
You are not restricted to using NCLU for configuration and can edit the
`/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file and control `snmpd` with `systemctl`
commands. For Cumulus Linux versions earlier than 3.0, `snmpd` has a
default configuration that listens to incoming requests on all
interfaces.

{{%notice info%}}

Cumulus Linux 3.6 and later releases support configuring VRFs for
listening-addresses as well as Trap/Inform support. If management VRF is
enabled on the switch, this places the eth0 interface in the management
VRF. When configuring the listening-address for snmp-server, you must
specify an additional parameter to enable listening on the eth0
interface with the following command:

`cumulus@router1:~$ net add snmp-server listening-address 10.10.10.10
vrf mgmt`

These additional parameters are described in detail below.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice note%}}

You must add a default community string for v1 or v2c environments or
the `snmpd` daemon does not respond to any requests. For security
reasons, the default configuration configures `snmpd` to listen to SNMP
requests on the loopback interface so access to the switch is restricted
to requests originating from the switch itself. The only required
commands for `snmpd` to function are a `listening-address` and either a
`username` or a`  readonly-community ` string.

### Configure SNMP with NCLU

The table below highlights the structure of NCLU commands available for
configuring SNMP. An example command set is provided below the table.
NCLU restarts the `snmpd` daemon after configuration changes are made
and committed.

Users often specify a source IP address token to restrict access to only that host or network given. You can specify a view name to restrict the subset of the OID tree.</p>

## Configure SNMP Manually

If you need to manually edit the SNMP configuration; for example, if the
necessary option has not been implemented in NCLU, you need to edit the
configuration directly, which is stored in the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`
file.

Use caution when editing this file. The next time you use NCLU to update
your SNMP configuration, if NCLU is unable to correctly parse the
syntax, some of the options might be overwritten.

Make sure you do not delete the `snmpd.conf` file; this can cause issues
with the package manager the next time you update Cumulus Linux.

The SNMP daemon, `snmpd`, uses the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` configuration
file for most of its configuration. The syntax of the most important
keywords are defined in the following table.

<td><p><strong>agentaddress</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Required.</strong> This command sets the protocol, IP address, and the port for <code>snmpd</code> to listen for <strong>incoming</strong> requests. The IP address must exist on an interface that has link UP on the switch where <code>snmpd</code> is being used. By default, this is set to <em>udp:127.0.0.1:161</em>, which means <code>snmpd</code> listens on the loopback interface and only responds to requests (<code>snmpwalk</code>, <code>snmpget</code>, <code>snmpgetnext</code>) originating from the switch. A wildcard setting of <em>udp:161,udp6:161</em> forces <code>snmpd</code> to listen on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces for incoming SNMP requests. You can configure multiple IP addresses as comma-separated values; for example, <em>udp:66.66.66.66:161,udp:77.77.77.77:161,udp6:[2001::1]:161.</em> You can use multiple lines to define listening addresses. To bind to a particular IP address within a particular VRF table, follow the IP address with a <code>@</code> and the name of the VRF table (for example, <code>10.10.10.10@mgmt</code>).</p></td>

<td><p><strong>rocommunity</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Required.</strong> This command defines the password that is required for SNMP version 1 or 2c requests for GET or GETNEXT. By default, this provides access to the full OID tree for such requests, regardless of from where they were sent. There is no default password set, so <code>snmpd</code> does not respond to any requests that arrive. Specify a source IP address token to restrict access to only that host or network given. Specify a view name (as defined above) to restrict the subset of the OID tree.</p>
<p>Examples of <code>rocommunity</code> commands are shown below. The first command sets the read only community string to <code>simplepassword</code> for SNMP requests sourced from the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet and restricts viewing to the <em>systemonly</em> view name defined previously with the <code>view</code> command. The second example creates a read-only community password that allows access to the entire OID tree from any source IP address.</p>

### Start the SNMP Daemon

Use the recommended process described below to start `snmpd` and monitor
it using `systemctl`.

{{%notice note%}}

As mentioned above, if you intend to run this service within a
[VRF](../../Layer-3/Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF/),
including the [management VRF](../../Layer-3/Management-VRF/), follow
[these steps](../../Layer-3/Management-VRF/#run-services-within-the-management-vrf)
for configuring the service.

{{%/notice%}}

To start the SNMP daemon:

1.  Start the `snmpd` daemon:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl start snmpd.service

2.  Configure the `snmpd` daemon to start automatically after reboot:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl enable snmpd.service

3.  To enable `snmpd` to restart automatically after failure:

    1.  Create a file called
        `/etc/systemd/system/snmpd.service.d/restart.conf`.

    2.  Add the following lines:

            [Service]
            Restart=always
            RestartSec=60

    3.  Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

After the service starts, you can use SNMP to manage various components
on the switch.

### Configure SNMP with Management VRF (used prior to Cumulus Linux 3.6)

When you configure [Management
VRF](../../Layer-3/Management-VRF/), you need to be aware of the
interface IP addresses on which SNMP is listening. If you set
listening-address to all, the `snmpd` daemon responds to incoming
requests on all interfaces that are in the default VRF. If you prefer to
listen on a limited number of IP addresses, Cumulus Networks recommends
that you run only one instance of the `snmpd` daemon and specify the VRF
name along with the listening-address. You can configure IP addresses in
different VRFs and a single SNMP daemon listens on multiple IP addresses
each with its own VRF. Because SNMP has native VRF awareness, using
systemctl commands to manage snmpd in different VRFs is no longer
necessary.

SNMP configuration in NCLU is VRF aware so you can configure the `snmpd`
daemon to listen to incoming SNMP requests on a particular IP address
within particular VRFs. Because interfaces in a particular VRF (routing
table) are not aware of interfaces in a different VRF, the `snmpd`
daemon only responds to polling requests and sends traps on the
interfaces of the VRF on which it is configured.

When management VRF is configured, configure the listening-address with
a VRF name as shown above. This allows snmpd to receive and respond to
SNMP polling requests on eth0.

Prior to Cumulus Linux 3.6, you could not configure a VRF name in the
listening-address or the trap-destination commands. To manually handle
VRF functionality, you had to do the following:

1.  Configure all the required SNMP settings with NCLU. Pay particular
    attention to the listening-address configuration setting, which
    should contain one or more IP addresses that belong to interfaces
    within a single VRF (if management VRF is configured, this is
    typically the IP address of eth0 ). You can use IP addresses other
    than eth0, but the interfaces for these IP addresses must be in the
    same VRF (typically the management VRF).

2.  Commit the changes to start the `snmpd` daemon in the default VRF.

3.  Manually stop the `snmpd` daemon from running in the default VRF.

4.  Manually restart the `snmpd` daemon in the management VRF.

{{%notice info%}}

**Running Multiple Instances of snmpd**

Prior to Cumulus Linux 3.6, more complex configurations may have been
needed; for example, you can run more than one `snmpd` daemon (one in
each VRF designed to receive SNMP polling requests). Cumulus Networks
does not recommend this for memory and CPU resource reasons. However, if
this is required, you must use a separate configuration file with each
instance of the `snmpd` daemon. You can use a copy of the
`/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file. When you use this file, start an `snmpd`
daemon with the following command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/snmpd -y -LS 0-4 d -Lf /dev/null -u snmp -g snmp -I -smux -p /run/snmpd.pid -C -c <new snmp config filename> (edited)

{{%/notice%}}

To use management VRF, you need to configure the IP address of eth0 as
the listening-address. In the example below, eth0 IP address is
10.10.10.10. You can also add other `snmp-server` configurations, then
commit the changes.

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server listening-address 10.10.10.10
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server readonly-community tempPassword access any
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

This restarts the `snmpd` daemon in the default VRF. Then, to run
`snmpd` in the correct VRF, stop the daemon in the default VRF (or stop
any other `snmpd` daemons that happen to be running), then restart
`snmpd` in the management VRF so that it can respond to requests on
interfaces only in that VRF. Make sure that only one instance of the
`snmpd` daemon is running and that it is running in the desired VRF.
Assuming the Management VRF has been enabled, the following example
shows how to stop `snmpd` and restart it in the management VRF.

    cumulus@switch:mgmt-vrf:~$ systemctl stop snmpd.service
    cumulus@switch:mgmt-vrf:~$ systemctl disable snmpd.service
    cumulus@switch:mgmt-vrf:~$ ps aux | grep snmpd
    cumulus@switch:mgmt-vrf:~$
    cumulus@switch:mgmt-vrf:~$ systemctl start snmpd@mgmt.service
    cumulus@switch:mgmt-vrf:~$ systemctl enable snmpd.service

### Set up the Custom Cumulus Networks MIBs

No changes are required in the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file on the switch
to support the custom Cumulus Networks MIBs. The following lines are
already included by default and provide support for both the Cumulus
Counters and the Cumulus Resource Query MIBs.

    sysObjectID 1.3.6.1.4.1.40310
    pass_persist .1.3.6.1.4.1.40310.1 /usr/share/snmp/resq_pp.py
    pass_persist .1.3.6.1.4.1.40310.2 /usr/share/snmp/cl_drop_cntrs_pp.py

However, you need to copy several files to the NMS server for the custom
Cumulus MIB to be recognized on NMS server.

  - `/usr/share/snmp/mibs/Cumulus-Snmp-MIB.txt`

  - `/usr/share/snmp/mibs/Cumulus-Counters-MIB.txt`

  - `/usr/share/snmp/mibs/Cumulus-Resource-Query-MIB.txt`

### Set the Community String

The `snmpd` authentication for versions 1 and 2 is disabled by default
in Cumulus Linux. You can enable this password (called a community
string) by setting **rocommunity** (for read-only access) or
**rwcommunity** (for read-write access). Setting a community string is
required.

To enable read-only querying by a client:

1.  Open the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file in a text editor.

2.  To allow read-only access, uncomment the following line, then save
    the file:

        rocommunity public default -V systemonly

3.  Restart `snmpd`:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart snmpd.service

## Enable SNMP Support for FRRouting

SNMP supports Routing MIBs in
[FRRouting](../../Layer-3/FRRouting-Overview/). To enable SNMP
support for FRRouting, you need to:

  - Configure [AgentX](http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/README.agentx.html)
    (ASX) access in FRRouting

  - The default `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` configuration already enables
    agentx and sets the correct permissions

Enabling FRRouting includes support for BGP. However, if you plan on
using the BGP4 MIB, be sure to provide access to the MIB tree
1.3.6.1.2.1.15.

{{%notice note%}}

At this time, SNMP does not support monitoring BGP unnumbered neighbors.

{{%/notice%}}

If you plan on using the OSPFv2 MIB, provide access to 1.3.6.1.2.1.14
and to 1.3.6.1.2.1.191 for the OSPv3 MIB.

To enable SNMP support for FRRouting:

1.  Configure AgentX access in FRRouting:

        cumulus@switch:~$ net add routing agentx
        cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
        cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

2.  Update the SNMP configuration to enable FRRouting to respond to SNMP
    requests. Open the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file in a text editor and
    verify that the following configuration exists:

        agentxsocket /var/agentx/master
        agentxperms 777 777 snmp snmp
        master agentx

    {{%notice note%}}

Make sure that the `/var/agentx` directory is world-readable and
    world-searchable (octal mode 755).

    {{%/notice%}}

3.  Optionally, you might need to expose various MIBs:

      - For the BGP4 MIB, allow access to `1.3.6.1.2.1.15`

      - For the OSPF MIB, allow access to `1.3.6.1.2.1.14`

      - For the OSPFV3 MIB, allow access to `1.3.6.1.2.1.191`

To verify the configuration, run `snmpwalk`. For example, if you have a
running OSPF configuration with routes, you can check this OSPF-MIB
first from the switch itself with:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo snmpwalk -v2c -cpublic localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.14

### Enable the .1.3.6.1.2.1 Range

Some MIBs, including storage information, are not included by default in
`snmpd.conf` in Cumulus Linux. This results in some default views on
common network tools (like `librenms`) to return less than optimal data.
You can include more MIBs by enabling all the .1.3.6.1.2.1 range. This
simplifies the configuration file, removing concern that any required
MIBs will be missed by the monitoring system. Various MIBs were added to
version 3.0 and include the following: ENTITY and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB and
parts of the BRIDGE-MIB and Q-BRIDGE-MIBs. These are included in the
default configuration.

{{%notice warning%}}

This configuration grants access to a large number of MIBs, including
all SNMPv2-MIB, which might reveal more data than expected. In addition
to being a security vulnerability, it might consume more CPU resources.

{{%/notice%}}

To enable the .1.3.6.1.2.1 range, make sure the view name commands
include the required MIB objects.

### Configure SNMPv3

SNMPv3 is often used to enable authentication and encryption, as
community strings in versions 1 and 2c are sent in plaintext. SNMPv3
usernames are added to the `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file, along with
plaintext authentication and encryption pass phrases.

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Networks recommends that you configure SNMPv3 usernames and
passwords with NCLU. However, if you prefer to edit the
`/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` manually instead, be aware that `snmpd` caches
SNMPv3 usernames and passwords in the /`var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf` file.
Make sure you stop `snmpd` and remove the old entries when making
changes. Otherwise, Cumulus Linux uses the old usernames and passwords
in the `/var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf` file instead of the ones in the
`/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` file.

{{%/notice%}}

The NCLU command structures for configuring SNMP user passwords are:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username <username> [auth-none] | [(auth-md5 | auth-sha) <auth-password>]
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username <username> auth-(none | sha | md5)  (oid <OID> | view <view>)

The example below defines five users, each with a different combination
of authentication and encryption:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username user1 auth-none
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username user2 auth-md5 user2password
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username user3 auth-md5 user3password encrypt-des user3encryption
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username user666 auth-sha user666password encrypt-aes user666encryption
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username user999 auth-md5 user999password encrypt-des user999encryption

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add snmp-server username user3 auth-sha testshax encrypt-aes testaesx oid 1.3.6.1.2.1
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

    rwuser user3 priv 1.3.6.1.2.1
    rwuser user666
    rwuser user999

After configuring user passwords and restarting the `snmpd` daemon, you
can check user access with a client.

{{%notice note%}}

The `snmp` Debian package contains `snmpget`, `snmpwalk`, and other
programs that are useful for checking daemon functionality from the
switch itself or from another workstation.

{{%/notice%}}

The following commands check the access for each user defined above from
the localhost:

    # check user1 which has no authentication or encryption (NoauthNoPriv)
    snmpget -v 3 -u user1 -l NoauthNoPriv localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
    snmpwalk -v 3 -u user1 -l NoauthNoPriv localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1
    Â 
    # check user2 which has authentication but no encryption (authNoPriv)
    snmpget -v 3 -u user2 -l authNoPriv -a MD5 -A user2password localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
    snmpget -v 3 -u user2 -l authNoPriv -a MD5 -A user2password localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0
    snmpwalk -v 3 -u user2 -l authNoPriv -a MD5 -A user2password localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1

    # check user3 which has both authentication and encryption (authPriv)
    snmpget -v 3 -u user3 -l authPriv -a MD5 -A user3password -x DES -X user3encryption localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
    snmpwalk -v 3 -u user3 -l authPriv -a MD5 -A user3password -x DES -X user3encryption localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1
    snmpwalk -v 3 -u user666 -l authPriv -a SHA -x AES -A user666password -X user666encryption localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1
    snmpwalk -v 3 -u user999 -l authPriv -a MD5 -x DES -A user999password -X user999encryption localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1

The following procedure shows a slightly more secure method of
configuring SNMPv3 users without creating cleartext passwords:

1.  Install the `net-snmp-config` script that is in `libsnmp-dev`
    package:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install libsnmp-dev

2.  Stop the daemon:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl stop snmpd.service

3.  Use the `net-snmp-config` command to create two users, one with MD5
    and DES, and the next with SHA and AES.

    {{%notice note%}}

The minimum password length is eight characters and the arguments
    `-a` and `-x` have different meanings in `net-snmp-config` than
    `snmpwalk`.

    {{%/notice%}}

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user -a md5authpass -x desprivpass -A MD5 -X DES userMD5withDES
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user -a shaauthpass -x aesprivpass -A SHA -X AES userSHAwithAES
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl start snmpd.service

This adds a `createUser` command in `/var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf`. Do
**not** edit this file by hand unless you are removing usernames. You
can edit this file and restrict access to certain parts of the MIB by
adding *noauth*, *auth* or *priv* to allow unauthenticated access,
require authentication, or to enforce use of encryption.

The `snmpd` daemon reads the information from the
`/var/lib/snmp/snpmd.conf` file and then the line is removed
(eliminating the storage of the master password for that user) and
replaced with the key that is derived from it (using the EngineID). This
key is a localized key, so that if it is stolen, it cannot be used to
access other agents. To remove the two users `userMD5withDES` and
`userSHAwithAES`, stop the `snmpd` daemon and edit the
`/var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf` file. Remove the lines containing the
username, then restart the `snmpd` daemon as in step 3 above.

From a client, you access the MIB with the correct credentials. (The
roles of `-x`, `-a` and `-X` and `-A` are reversed on the client side as
compared with the `net-snmp-config` command used above.)

    snmpwalk -v 3 -u userMD5withDES -l authPriv -a MD5 -x DES -A md5authpass -X desprivpass localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1
    snmpwalk -v 3 -u userSHAwithAES -l authPriv -a SHA -x AES -A shaauthpass -X aesprivpass localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1

## Manually Configure SNMP Traps (Non-NCLU)

### Generate Event Notification Traps

The Net-SNMP agent provides a method to generate SNMP trap events using
the Distributed Management (DisMan) Event MIB for various system events,
including:

  - Link up/down.

  - Exceeding the temperature sensor threshold, CPU load, or memory
    threshold.

  - Other SNMP MIBs.

To enable specific types of traps, you need to create the following
configurations in `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`.

#### Define Access Credentials

An SNMPv3 username is required to authorize the DisMan service even
though you are not configuring SNMPv3 here. The example `snmpd.conf`
configuration shown below creates *trapusername* as the username using
the `createUser` command. `iquerySecName` defines the default SNMPv3
username to be used when making internal queries to retrieve monitored
expressions. `rouser` specifies which username to use for these SNMPv3
queries. All three are required for `snmpd` to retrieve information and
send traps (even with the `monitor` command shown below in the
examples). Add the following lines to your `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`
configuration file:

    createuser trapusername
    iquerysecname trapusername
    rouser trapusername

{{%notice note%}}

`iquerysecname` specifies the default SNMPv3 username to be used when
making internal queries to retrieve any necessary information â either
for evaluating the monitored expression or building a notification
payload. These internal queries always use SNMPv3, even if normal
querying of the agent is done using SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c. Note that this
user must also be explicitly created via `createUser` and given
appropriate access rights, for `rouser`, for example. The
`iquerysecname` directive is purely concerned with defining which user
should be used, not with actually setting this user up.

{{%/notice%}}

#### Define Trap Receivers

The following configuration defines the trap receiver IP address where
SNMPv2 traps are sent:

    trap2sink 192.168.1.1 public
    # For SNMPv1 Traps, use
    # trapsink  192.168.1.1  public

{{%notice note%}}

Although the traps are sent to an SNMPV2 receiver, the SNMPv3 user is
still required. Starting with Net-SNMP 5.3, `snmptrapd` no longer
accepts all traps by default. `snmptrapd` must be configured with
authorized SNMPv1/v2c community strings and/or SNMPv3 users.
Non-authorized traps/informs are dropped. Refer to the
[snmptrapd.conf(5) manual
page](http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmptrapd.conf.html) for details.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice note%}}

It is possible to define multiple trap receivers and to use the domain
name instead of an IP address in the `trap2sink` directive.

{{%/notice%}}

Restart the `snmpd` service to apply the changes.

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart snmpd.service

#### SNMP Version 3 Trap and Inform Messages

You can configure SNMPv3 trap and inform messages with the ` trapsess
 `configuration command. Inform messages are traps that are acknowledged
by the receiving trap daemon. You configure inform messages with the`
-Ci  `parameter. You must specify the EngineID of the receiving trap
server with the `-e` field.

    trapsess -Ci -e 0x80ccff112233445566778899 -v3 -l authPriv  -u trapuser1 -a MD5 -A trapuser1password -x DES -X trapuser1encryption 192.168.1.1

The SNMP trap receiving daemon must have usernames, authentication
passwords, and encryption passwords created with its own EngineID. You
must configure this trap server EngineID in the switch `snmpd` daemon
sending the trap and inform messages. You specify the level of
authentication and encryption for SNMPv3 trap and inform messages with
`-l` (`NoauthNoPriv, authNoPriv,` or `authPriv`).

{{%notice note%}}

You can define multiple trap receivers and use the domain name instead
of an IP address in the `trap2sink` directive.

{{%/notice%}}

After you complete the configuration, restart the `snmpd` service to
apply the changes:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart snmpd.service

#### Source Traps from a Different Source IP Address

When client SNMP programs (such as `snmpget`, `snmpwalk`, or `snmptrap`)
are run from the command line, or when `snmpd` is configured to send a
trap (based on `snmpd.conf`), you can configure a *clientaddr* in
`snmp.conf` that allows the SNMP client programs or `snmpd` (for traps)
to source requests from a different source IP address.

{{%notice note%}}

`snmptrap`, `snmpget`, `snmpwalk` and `snmpd` itself must be able to
bind to this address.

{{%/notice%}}

For more information, read the the `snmp.conf` man page:

    clientaddr [<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>
                  specifies the source address to be used by command-line applicaâ
                  tions when sending SNMP requests. See snmpcmd(1) for more inforâ
                  mation about the format of addresses.
                  This value is also used by snmpd when generating notifications.

#### Monitor Fans, Power Supplies, and Transformers

An SNMP agent (`snmpd`) waits for incoming SNMP requests and responds to
them. If no requests are received, an agent does not initiate any
actions. However, various commands can configure `snmpd` to send traps
based on preconfigured settings (`load`, `file`, `proc`, `disk`, or
`swap` commands), or customized `monitor` commands.

From the `snmpd.conf` man page, the `monitor` command is defined this
way:

    monitor [OPTIONS] NAME EXPRESSION
    Â 
                  defines  a  MIB  object to monitor.  If the EXPRESSION condition holds then
                  this will trigger the corresponding event, and either send a notification or
                  apply a SET assignment (or both).  Note that the event will only be triggered once,
                  when the expression first matches.  This monitor entry will not fire again until the
                  monitored condition first becomes false, and then matches again.  NAME is an administrative
                  name for this expression, and is used for indexing the mteTriggerTable (and related tables).
                  Note also that such monitors use an internal SNMPv3 request to retrieve the values
                  being monitored (even  if  normal  agent  queries  typically  use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c).
                  See the iquerySecName token described above.
    Â 
           EXPRESSION
                  There are three types of monitor expression supported by the Event MIB - existence, boolean and threshold tests.
    Â 
                  OID | ! OID | != OID
    Â 
                         defines  an  existence(0)  monitor  test.  A bare OID specifies a present(0) test,
                         which will fire when (an instance of) the monitored OID is created.  An expression
                         of the form ! OID specifies an absent(1) test, which will fire when the monitored
                         OID is delected.  An expression of the form != OID specifies a changed(2) test,
                         which will fire whenever the monitored value(s) change.  Note that there must be
                         whitespace before the OID token.
    Â 
                  OID OP VALUE
    Â 
                         defines a boolean(1) monitor test.  OP should be one of the defined comparison operators
                         (!=, ==, <, <=, >, >=) and VALUE should be an integer value to compare against.  Note that
                         there must be whitespace around the OP token.  A comparison such as OID !=0 will not be
                         handled correctly.
    Â 
                  OID MIN MAX [DMIN DMAX]
    Â 
                         defines a threshold(2) monitor test.  MIN and MAX are integer values, specifying
                         lower and upper thresholds.  If the value of the monitored OID falls below the lower
                         threshold (MIN) or rises above the upper threshold (MAX), then the monitor entry will
                         trigger the corresponding event.
    Â 
                         Note that the rising threshold event will only be re-armed when the monitored value
                         falls below the lower threshold (MIN).  Similarly, the falling threshold event will
                         be re-armed by the upper threshold (MAX).
    Â 
                         The optional parameters DMIN and DMAX configure a pair of similar threshold tests,
                         but working with the delta differences between successive sample values.
    Â 
           OPTIONS
    Â 
                  There are various options to control the behaviour of the monitored expression.  These include:
                  -D     indicates that the expression should be evaluated using delta differences between sample
                         values (rather than the values themselves).
                  -d OID  or  -di OID
                         specifies a discontinuity marker for validating delta differences.  A -di object instance
                         will be used exactly as given.  A -d object will have the instance subidentifiers from
                         the corresponding (wildcarded) expression object appended.  If the -I flag is specified,
                         then there is no difference between these two options. This option also implies -D.
                  -e EVENT
                         specifies the event to be invoked when this monitor entry is triggered.  If this option
                         is not given, the monitor entry will generate one of the standard notifications defined
                         in the DISMAN-EVENT-MIB.
                  -I     indicates that the monitored expression should be applied to the specified OID as a
                         single instance.  By default, the OID will be treated as a wildcarded object, and the
                         monitor expanded to cover all matching instances.
                  -i OID or -o OID
                         define additional varbinds to be added to the notification payload when this monitor
                         trigger fires.  For a wildcarded expression, the suffix of the matched instance will be
                         added to any OIDs specified using -o, while OIDs specified using -i will be treated
                         as exact instances.  If the -I flag is specified,  then  there  is  no difference between
                         these two options.
                         See strictDisman for details of the ordering of notification payloads.
                  -r FREQUENCY
                         monitors the given expression every FREQUENCY, where FREQUENCY is in seconds or optionally
                         suffixed by one of s (for seconds), m (for minutes), h (for hours), d (for days),
                         or w (for weeks).  By default, the expression will be evaluated every 600s (10 minutes).
                  -S     indicates that the monitor expression should not be evaluated when the agent first starts up.
                         The first evaluation will be done once the first repeat interval has expired.
                  -s     indicates that the monitor expression should be evaluated when the agent first starts up.
                         This is the default behaviour.
                         Note:  Notifications triggered by this initial evaluation will be sent before the coldStart trap.
                  -u SECNAME
                         specifies a security name to use for scanning the local host, instead of the default
                         iquerySecName.  Once again, this user must be explicitly created and given suitable access rights.

You can configure`  snmpd  `to monitor the operational status of an
Entity MIB or Entity-Sensor MIB. You can determine the operational
status, given as a value of *ok(1)*, *unavailable(2)* or
*nonoperational(3)*, by adding the following example configuration to
`/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` and adjusting the values:

  - Using the `entPhySensorOperStatus` integer:

        # without installing extra MIBS we can check the check Fan1 status
        # if the Fan1 index is 100011001, monitor this specific OID (-I) every 10 seconds (-r), and defines additional information to be included in the trap (-o).
        monitor -I -r 10  -o 1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7.100011001 "Fan1 Not OK"  1.3.6.1.2.1.99.1.1.1.5.100011001 > 1
        # Any Entity Status non OK (greater than 1)
        monitor  -r 10  -o 1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7  "Sensor Status Failure"  1.3.6.1.2.1.99.1.1.1.5 > 1

  - Using the OID name:

        # for a specific fan called Fan1 with an index 100011001
        monitor -I -r 10  -o entPhysicalName.100011001 "Fan1 Not OK"  entPhySensorOperStatus.100011001 > 1
        # for any Entity Status not OK ( greater than 1)
        monitor  -r 10  -o entPhysicalName  "Sensor Status Failure"  entPhySensorOperStatus > 1

    {{%notice note%}}

You can use the OID name if the `snmp-mibs-downloader` package is
    installed.

    {{%/notice%}}

    {{%notice note%}}

The `entPhySensorOperStatus` integer can be found by walking the
    `entPhysicalName` table.

    {{%/notice%}}

  - To get all sensor information, run `snmpwalk` on the
    `entPhysicalName` table. For example:

#### Enable MIB to OID Translation

MIB names can be used instead of OIDs, by installing the
`snmp-mibs-downloader`, to download SNMP MIBs to the switch prior to
enabling traps. This greatly improves the readability of the
`snmpd.conf` file.

1.  Open `/etc/apt/sources.list` in a text editor.

2.  Add the `non-free` repository, then save the file:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main non-free

3.  Update the switch:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update

4.  Install the `snmp-mibs-downloader`:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install snmp-mibs-downloader

5.  Open the `/etc/snmp/snmp.conf` file to verify that the `mibs :` line
    is commented out:

        #
        # As the snmp packages come without MIB files due to license reasons, loading
        # of MIBs is disabled by default. If you added the MIBs you can reenable
        # loading them by commenting out the following line.
        #mibs :

6.  Open the `/etc/default/snmpd` file to verify that the `export MIBS=`
    line is commented out:

        # This file controls the activity of snmpd and snmptrapd
        Â 
        # Don't load any MIBs by default.
        # You might comment this lines once you have the MIBs Downloaded.
        #export MIBS=

7.  After you confirm the configuration, remove or comment out the
    `non-free` repository in `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

        #deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main non-free

#### Configure Link Up/Down Notifications

The `linkUpDownNotifications` directive is used to configure link
up/down notifications when the operational status of the link changes.

    linkUpDownNotifications yes

{{%notice note%}}

The default frequency for checking link up/down is 60 seconds. You can
change the default frequency using the `monitor` directive directly
instead of the `linkUpDownNotifications` directive. See `man snmpd.conf`
for details.

{{%/notice%}}

#### Configure Temperature Notifications

Temperature sensor information for each available sensor is maintained
in the the lmSensors MIB. Each platform can contain a different number
of temperature sensors. The example below generates a trap event when
any temperature sensor exceeds a threshold of 68 degrees (centigrade).
It monitors each `lmTempSensorsValue`. When the threshold value is
checked and exceeds the `lmTempSensorsValue`, a trap is generated. The
`-o lmTempSenesorsDevice` option is used to instruct SNMP to also
include the lmTempSensorsDevice MIB in the generated trap. The default
frequency for the `monitor` directive is 600 seconds. You can change the
default frequency with the `-r` option.:

    monitor lmTemSensor -o lmTempSensorsDevice lmTempSensorsValue > 68000

To monitor the sensors individually, first use the `sensors` command to
determine which sensors are available to be monitored on the platform.

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo sensors

    CY8C3245-i2c-4-2e
    Adapter: i2c-0-mux (chan_id 2)
    fan5: 7006 RPM (min = 2500 RPM, max = 23000 RPM)
    fan6: 6955 RPM (min = 2500 RPM, max = 23000 RPM)
    fan7: 6799 RPM (min = 2500 RPM, max = 23000 RPM)
    fan8: 6750 RPM (min = 2500 RPM, max = 23000 RPM)
    temp1: +34.0 C (high = +68.0 C)
    temp2: +28.0 C (high = +68.0 C)
    temp3: +33.0 C (high = +68.0 C)
    temp4: +31.0 C (high = +68.0 C)
    temp5: +23.0 C (high = +68.0 C)

Configure a `monitor` command for the specific sensor using the `-I`
option. The `-I` option indicates that the monitored expression is
applied to a single instance. In this example, there are five
temperature sensors available. Use the following directive to monitor
only temperature sensor 3 at 5 minute intervals.

    monitor -I -r 300 lmTemSensor3 -o lmTempSensorsDevice.3 lmTempSensorsValue.3 > 68000

#### Configure Free Memory Notifications

You can monitor free memory using the following directives. The example
below generates a trap when free memory drops below 1,000,000KB. The
free memory trap also includes the amount of total real memory:

    monitor MemFreeTotal -o memTotalReal memTotalFree <  1000000

#### Configure Processor Load Notifications

To monitor CPU load for 1, 5, or 15 minute intervals, use the `load`
directive with the `monitor` directive. The following example generates
a trap when the 1 minute interval reaches 12%, the 5 minute interval
reaches 10%, or the 15 minute interval reaches 5%.

    load 12 10 5

#### Configure Disk Utilization Notifications

To monitor disk utilization for all disks, use the `includeAllDisks`
directive together with the `monitor` directive. The example code below
generates a trap when a disk is 99% full:

    includeAllDisks 1%
    monitor -r 60 -o dskPath -o DiskErrMsg "dskTable" diskErrorFlag !=0

#### Configure Authentication Notifications

To generate authentication failure traps, use the `authtrapenable`
directive:

    authtrapenable 1

### snmptrapd.conf

Use the Net-SNMP trap daemon to **receive** SNMP traps. The
`/etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf` file is used to configure how **incoming**
traps are processed. Starting with Net-SNMP release 5.3, you must
specify who is authorized to send traps and informs to the notification
receiver (and what types of processing these are allowed to trigger).
You can specify three processing types:

  - *log* logs the details of the notification in a specified file to
    standard output (or stderr), or through syslog (or similar).

  - *execute* passes the details of the trap to a specified handler
    program, including embedded Perl.

  - *net* forwards the trap to another notification receiver.

Typically, this configuration is *log,execute,net* to cover any style of
processing for a particular category of notification. But it is possible
(even desirable) to limit certain notification sources to selected
processing only.

`authCommunity TYPES COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -v VIEW ]]` authorizes
traps and SNMPv2c INFORM requests with the specified community to
trigger the types of processing listed. By default, this allows any
notification using this community to be processed. You can use the
SOURCE field to specify that the configuration only applies to
notifications received from particular sources. For more information
about specific configuration options within the file, look at the
`snmpd.conf(5)` man page with the following command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ man 5 snmptrapd.conf

    ###############################################################################

## Pass Persist Scripts

The pass persist scripts in Cumulus Linux use the [pass\_persist
extension](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Tut:Extending_snmpd_using_shell_scripts#Pass_persist)
to Net-SNMP. The scripts are stored in `/usr/share/snmp` and include:

  - bgp4\_pp.py
  - bridge\_pp.py
  - cl\_drop\_cntrs\_pp.py
  - cl\_poe\_pp.py
  - entity\_pp.py
  - entity\_sensor\_pp.py
  - ieee8023\_lag\_pp.py
  - resq\_pp.py
  - snmpifAlias\_pp.py
  - sysDescr\_pass.py

All the scripts are enabled by default in Cumulus Linux, except for:

  - `bgp4_pp.py`, which is now handled by
    [FRRouting](../../Layer-3/FRRouting-Overview/) instead of
    Quagga, so monitoring has changed accordingly.
  - `cl_poe_pp.py`, which is disabled by default as only certain
    platforms that Cumulus Linux supports are capable of doing [Power over Ethernet](../../System-Configuration/Power-over-Ethernet-PoE/).

## Troubleshooting

Use the following commands to troubleshoot potential SNMP issues:
