You can generate authentication keys to access a Cumulus Linux switch securely with the `ssh-keygen` component of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. Cumulus Linux uses the OpenSSH package to provide this functionality. This section describes how to generate an SSH key pair.

## Generate an SSH Key Pair

1. To generate the SSH key pair, run the `ssh-keygen` command and follow the prompts:

    {{%notice info%}}

To configure a completely passwordless system, do not enter a passphrase when prompted in the following step.

    {{%/notice%}}

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
5a:b4:16:a0:f9:14:6b:51:f6:f6:c0:76:1a:35:2b:bb cumulus@leaf04
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|      +.o   o    |
|     o * o . o   |
|    o + o O o    |
|     + . = O     |
|      . S o .    |
|       +   .     |
|      .   E      |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+
```

2. To copy the generated public key to the desired location, run the `ssh-copy-id` command and follow the prompts:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ ssh-copy-id -i /home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cumulus@leaf02
The authenticity of host 'leaf02 (192.168.0.11)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is b1:ce:b7:6a:20:f4:06:3a:09:3c:d9:42:de:99:66:6e.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
cumulus@leaf01's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1
```

    `ssh-copy-id` does not work if the username on the remote switch is different from the username on the local switch. To work around this issue, use the `scp` command instead:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub cumulus@leaf02:.ssh/authorized_keys
Enter passphrase for key '/home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa':
id_rsa.pub
```

3. Connect to the remote switch to confirm that the authentication keys are in place:

```
cumulus@leaf01:~$ ssh cumulus@leaf02
