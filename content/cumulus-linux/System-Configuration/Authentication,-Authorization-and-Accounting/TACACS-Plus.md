Cumulus Linux implements TACACS+ client AAA (Accounting, Authentication,
and Authorization) in a transparent way with minimal configuration. The
client implements the TACACS+ protocol as described in
[this IETF document](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grant-tacacs-02).
There is no need to create accounts or directories on the switch. Accounting
records are sent to all configured TACACS+ servers by default. Use of
per-command authorization requires additional setup on the switch.

## Supported Features

  - Authentication using PAM; includes `login`, `ssh`, `sudo` and `su`
  - Runs over the eth0 management interface
  - Ability to run in the [management VRF](../../../Layer-3/Management-VRF/)
  - TACACS+ privilege 15 users can run any command with sudo using the
    `/etc/sudoers.d/tacplus` file that is installed by the
    `libtacplus-map1` package
  - Up to seven TACACS+ servers

## Install the TACACS+ Client Packages

TACACS+ requires the following packages to be installed on Cumulus
Linux. These packages are not part of the base Cumulus Linux image
installation.

To install all required packages, run these commands:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install tacplus-client

## Configure the TACACS+ Client

After installing TACACS+, edit the `/etc/tacplus_servers` file to add at
least one server and one shared secret (key). You can specify the
`server` and secret parameters in any order anywhere in the file.
Whitespace (spaces or tabs) are not allowed. For example, if your
TACACS+ server IP address is `192.168.0.30` and your shared secret is
`tacacskey`, add these parameters to the `/etc/tacplus_servers` file:

    secret=tacacskey
    server=192.168.0.30

Cumulus Linux supports a maximum of seven TACACS+ servers.

{{%notice note%}}

To specify multiple servers, they can be added, one per line, to the
`/etc/tacplus_servers` file.

{{%/notice%}}

Connections are made in the order in which they are listed in this file.
In most cases, you do not need to change any other parameters. You can
add parameters used by any of the packages to this file, which affects
all the TACACS+ client software. For example, the timeout value for NSS
lookups (see description below) is set to 5 seconds by default in the
`/etc/tacplus_nss.conf` file, whereas the timeout value for other
packages is 10 seconds and is set in the `/etc/tacplus_servers` file.
The timeout value is per connection to the TACACS+ servers. (If
authorization is configured per command, the timeout occurs for *each*
command.) There are several (typically four) connections to the server
per login attempt from PAM, as well as two or more through NSS.
Therefore, with the default timeout values, a TACACS+ server that is not
reachable can delay logins by a minute or more per unreachable server.
If you must list unreachable TACACS+ servers, place them at the end of
the server list and consider reducing the timeout values.

When you add or remove TACACS+ servers, you must restart `auditd` (with
the `systemctl restart auditd` command) or you must send a signal (with
`killall -HUP audisp-tacplus`) before `audisp-tacplus` rereads the
configuration to see the changed server list.

You can also configure the IP address used as the source IP address when
communicating with the TACACS+ server. See
[TACACS Configuration Parameters](#tacacs-configuration-parameters) below for the
full list of TACACS+ parameters.

Following is the complete list of the TACACS+ client configuration
files, and their use.

| Filename                                | Description      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| /etc/tacplus\_servers                   | This is the primary file that requires configuration after installation. The file is used by all packages with `include=/etc/tacplus_servers` parameters in the other configuration files that are installed. Typically, this file contains the shared secrets; make sure that the Linux file mode is 600.      |
| /etc/nsswitch.conf                      | When the `libnss_tacplus` package is installed, this file is configured to enable tacplus lookups via `libnss_tacplus`. If you replace this file by automation or other means, you need to add tacplus as the first lookup method for the *passwd* database line.  |
| /etc/tacplus\_nss.conf                  | This file sets the basic parameters for `libnss_tacplus`. It includes a debug variable for debugging NSS lookups separately from other client packages.             |
| /usr/share/pam-configs/tacplus          | This is the configuration file for `pam-auth-update` to generate the files in the next row. These configurations are used at `login`, by `su`, and by `ssh`.  |
| /etc/pam.d/common-\*                    | The `/etc/pam.d/common-*` files are updated for `tacplus` authentication. The files are updated with `pam-auth-update`, when `libpam-tacplus` is installed or removed.             |
| /etc/sudoers.d/tacplus                  | This file allows TACACS+ privilege level 15 users to run commands with `sudo`. The file includes an example (commented out) of how to enable privilege level 15 TACACS users to use `sudo` without having to enter a password and provides an example of how to enable all TACACS users to run specific commands with sudo. You can edit this file only with this command: `visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/tacplus`. |
| audisp-tacplus.conf                     | This is the `audisp` plugin configuration file. Typically, no modifications are required. |
| /etc/audisp/audisp-tac\_plus.conf       | This is the TACACS+ server configuration file for accounting. Typically, no modifications are required. You can use this configuration file when you only want to debug TACACS+ accounting issues, not all TACACS+ users.  |
| /etc/audit/rules.d/audisp-tacplus.rules | The `auditd` rules for TACACS+ accounting. The `augenrules` command uses all rule files to generate the rules file (described below).         |
| /etc/audit/audit.rules                  | This is the audit rules file generated when `auditd` is installed.   |

{{%notice warning%}}

You can edit the `/etc/pam.d/common-*` files manually. However, if you
run `pam-auth-update` again after making the changes, the update fails.
Only perform configuration in `/usr/share/pam-configs/tacplus`, then run
`pam-auth-update`.

{{%/notice%}}

## TACACS+ Authentication (login)

The initial authentication configuration is done through the PAM modules
and an updated version of the `libpam-tacplus` package. When the package
is installed, the PAM configuration is updated in `/etc/pam.d` with the
`pam-auth-update` command. If you have made changes to your PAM
configuration, you need to integrate these changes yourself. If you are
also using LDAP with the ` libpam-ldap  `package, you might need to edit
the PAM configuration to ensure the LDAP and TACACS ordering that you
prefer. The `libpam-tacplus` are configured to skip over rules and the
values in the ` success=2  `might require adjustments to skip over LDAP
rules.

A user privilege level is determined by the TACACS+ privilege attribute
`priv_lvl` for the user that is returned by the TACACS+ server during
the user authorization exchange. The client accepts the attribute in
either the mandatory or optional forms and also accepts `priv-lvl` as
the attribute name. The attribute value must be a numeric string in the
range 0 to 15, with 15 the most privileged level.

{{%notice note%}}

By default, TACACS+ users at privilege levels other than 15 are not
allowed to run `sudo` commands and are limited to commands that can be
run with standard Linux user permissions.

{{%/notice%}}

## Local Fallback Authentication

If a site wants to allow local fallback authentication for a user when
none of the TACACS servers can be reached, you can add a privileged user
account as a local account on the switch.

To configure local fallback authentication:

1.  Edit the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file to remove the keyword `tacplus`
    from the line starting with `passwd`. (You need to add the keyword
    back in step 3.)

    An example of the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file with the keyword
    `tacplus` removed from the line starting with `passwd` is shown
    below.

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vi /etc/nsswitch.conf
        #
        # Example configuration of GNU Name Service Switch functionality.
        # If you have the `glibc-doc-reference' and `info' packages installed, try:
        # `info libc "Name Service Switch"' for information about this file.
        passwd:         compat
        group:          compat
        shadow:         compat
        gshadow:        files
        ...

2.  To enable the local privileged user to run `sudo` and NCLU commands,
    run the `adduser` commands shown below. In the example commands, the
    TACACS account name is tacadmin.

    {{%notice note%}}

The first `adduser` command prompts for information and a password.
    You can skip most of the requested information by pressing ENTER.

    {{%/notice%}}

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo adduser --ingroup tacacs tacadmin
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo adduser tacadmin netedit
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo adduser tacadmin sudo

3.  Edit the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file to add the keyword `tacplus` back
    to the line starting with `passwd` (the keyword you removed in the
    first step).

4.  Restart the `netd` service with the following command:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart netd

## TACACS+ Accounting

TACACS+ accounting is implemented with the `audisp` module, with an
additional plugin for `auditd`/`audisp`. The plugin maps the auid in the
accounting record to a TACACS login, based on the `auid` and
`sessionid`. The `audisp` module requires `libnss_tacplus` and uses the
`libtacplus_map.so` library interfaces as part of the modified
`lipam_tacplus` package.

Communication with the TACACS+ servers is done with the
`libsimple-tacact1` library, through `dlopen()`. A maximum of 240 bytes
of command name and arguments are sent in the accounting record, due to
the TACACS+ field length limitation of 255 bytes.

{{%notice note%}}

All Linux commands result in an accounting record, including commands
run as part of the login process or as sub-processes of other commands.
This can sometimes generate a large number of accounting records.

{{%/notice%}}

Configure the IP address and encryption key of the server in the
`/etc/tacplus_servers` file. Minimal configuration to `auditd` and
`audisp` is necessary to enable the audit records necessary for
accounting. These records are installed as part of the package.

`audisp-tacplus` installs the audit rules for command accounting.
Modifying the configuration files is not usually necessary. However,
when a [management VRF](../../../Layer-3/Management-VRF/) is
configured, the accounting configuration does need special modification
because the `auditd` service starts prior to networking. It is necessary
to add the *vrf* parameter and to signal the `audisp-tacplus` process to
reread the configuration. The example below shows that the management
VRF is named *mgmt*. You can place the *vrf* parameter in either the
`/etc/tacplus_servers` file or in the `/etc/audisp/audisp-tac_plus.conf`
file.

    vrf=mgmt

After editing the configuration file, send the **HUP** signal `killall
-HUP audisp-tacplus` to notify the accounting process to reread the
file.

{{%notice note%}}

All `sudo` commands run by TACACS+ users generate accounting records
against the original TACACS+ login name.

{{%/notice%}}

For more information, refer to the `audisp.8` and `auditd.8` man pages.

## Configure NCLU for TACACS Plus Users

When you install or upgrade TACACS+ packages, mapped user accounts are
created automatically. All *tacacs0* through *tacacs15* users are added
to the *netshow* group.

In order for any TACACS+ users to execute `net add`, `net del`, and `net
commit` commands and to restart services with NCLU, you need to add
those users to the `users_with_edit` variable in the `/etc/netd.conf`
file. Cumulus Networks recommends you add the *tacacs15* user and,
depending upon your policies, other users (*tacacs1* through *tacacs14*)
to this variable.

To give a TACACS+ user access to the show commands, add the *tacacs*
group to the `groups_with_show` variable.

{{%notice warning%}}

Do not add the *tacacs* group to the `groups_with_edit` variable; this
is dangerous and can potentially enable any user to log into the switch
as the root user.

{{%/notice%}}

To add the users, edit the `/etc/netd.conf` file:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/netd.conf

    ...

    # Control which users/groups are allowed to run "add", "del",
    # "clear", "abort", and "commit" commands.
    users_with_edit = root, cumulus, tacacs15
    groups_with_edit = netedit

    # Control which users/groups are allowed to run "show" commands
    users_with_show = root, cumulus
    groups_with_show = netshow, netedit, tacacs

    ...

After you save and exit the `netd.conf` file, restart the `netd`
service. Run:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart netd

## TACACS+ Per-command Authorization

The `tacplus-auth` command handles the per-command authorization. To
make this an enforced authorization, you must change the TACACS+ login
to use a restricted shell, with a very limited executable search path.
Otherwise, the user can bypass the authorization. The `tacplus-restrict`
utility simplifies the setup of the restricted environment. The example
below initializes the environment for the *tacacs0* user account. This
is the account used for TACACS+ users at privilege level `0`.

    tacuser0@switch:~$ sudo tacplus-restrict -i -u tacacs0 -a command1 command2 ... commandN

If the user/command combination is not authorized by the TACACS+ server,
a message similar to the following displays:

    tacuser0@switch:~$ net show version
    net not authorized by TACACS+ with given arguments, not executing

The following table provides the command options:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Option</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>

<td><p>Initializes the environment. You only need to issue this option once per username.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>-a</p></td>
<td><p>You can invoke the utility with the <code>-a</code> option as many times as desired. For each command in the <code>-a</code> list, a symbolic link is created from <code>tacplus-auth</code> to the relative portion of the command name in the local <code>bin</code> subdirectory. You also need to enable these commands on the TACACS+ server (refer to the TACACS+ server documentation). It is common to have the server allow some options to a command, but not others.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>-f</p></td>
<td><p>Re-initializes the environment. If you need to restart, issue the <code>-f</code> option with <code>-i</code> to force the re-initialization; otherwise, repeated use of <code>-i</code> is ignored.</p>
<p>As part of the initialization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The user's shell is changed to <code>/bin/rbash</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Any existing dot files are saved.</p></li>
<li><p>A limited environment is set up that does not allow general command execution, but instead allows only commands from the user's local <code>bin</code> subdirectory.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For example, if you want to allow the user to be able to run the `net`
and `ip` commands (if authorized by the TACACS+ server), use the
command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo tacplus-restrict -i -u tacacs0 -a ip net

After running this command, examine the `tacacs0` directory::

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ls -lR ~tacacs0
    total 12
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Nov 21 22:07 ip -> /usr/sbin/tacplus-auth
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Nov 21 22:07 net -> /usr/sbin/tacplus-auth

Other than shell built-ins, the only two commands the privilege level 0
TACACS users can run are the `ip` and `net` commands.

If you mistakenly add potential commands with the `-a` option, you can
remove them. The example below shows how to remove the `net` command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo rm ~tacacs0/bin/net

You can remove all commands as follows:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo rm ~tacacs0/bin/*

Use the `man` command on the switch for more information on
`tacplus-auth` and `tacplus-restrict`.

    cumulus@switch:~$ man tacplus-auth tacplus-restrict

## NSS Plugin

When used with `pam_tacplus`, TACACS+ authenticated users can log in
without a local account on the system using the NSS plugin that comes
with the `tacplus_nss` package. The plugin uses the mapped `tacplus`
information if the user is not found in the local password file,
provides the `getpwnam()` and `getpwuid()`entry point,s and uses the
TACACS+ authentication functions.

The plugin asks the TACACS+ server if the user is known, and then for
relevant attributes to determine the privilege level of the user. When
the `libnss_tacplus` package is installed, `nsswitch.conf` is modified
to set `tacplus` as the first lookup method for `passwd`. If the order
is changed, lookups return the local accounts, such as `tacacs0`

If the user is not found, a mapped lookup is performed using the
`libtacplus.so` exported functions. The privilege level is appended to
`tacacs` and the lookup searches for the name in the local password
file. For example, privilege level 15 searches for the tacacs15 user. If
the user is found, the password structure is filled in with information
for the user.

If the user is not found, the privilege level is decremented and checked
again until privilege level 0 (user t`acacs0`) is reached. This allows
use of only the two local users `tacacs0` and `tacacs15`, if minimal
configuration is desired.

## TACACS Configuration Parameters

The recognized configuration options are the same as the
`libpam_tacplus` command line arguments; however, not all `pam_tacplus`
options are supported. These configuration parameters are documented in
the `tacplus_servers.5` man page, which is part of the `libpam-tacplus`
package.

## Remove the TACACS+ Client Packages

To remove all of the TACACS+ client packages, use the following
commands:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get remove tacplus-client
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get autoremove

To remove the TACACS+ client configuration files as well as the packages
(recommended), use this command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get autoremove --purge

## Troubleshooting

### Basic Server Connectivity or NSS Issues

You can use the `getent` command to determine if TACACS+ is configured
correctly and if the local password is stored in the configuration
files. In the example commands below, the cumulus user represents the
local user, while cumulusTAC represents the TACACS user.

To look up the username within all NSS methods:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo getent passwd cumulusTAC
    cumulusTAC:x:1016:1001:TACACS+ mapped user at privilege level 15,,,:/home/tacacs15:/bin/bash

To look up the user within the local database only:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo getent -s compat passwd cumulus
    cumulus:x:1000:1000:cumulus,,,:/home/cumulus:/bin/bash

To look up the user within the TACACS+ database only:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo getent -s tacplus passwd cumulusTAC
    cumulusTAC:x:1016:1001:TACACS+ mapped user at privilege level 15,,,:/home/tacacs15:/bin/bash

If TACACS does not appear to be working correctly, debug the following
configuration files by adding the *debug=1* parameter to one or more of
these files:

  - /etc/tacplus\_servers

  - /etc/tacplus\_nss.conf

{{%notice note%}}

*`You can also add` debug=1* to individual `pam_tacplus` lines in
`/etc/pam.d/common*`.

{{%/notice%}}

All log messages are stored in `/var/log/syslog`.

#### Incorrect Shared Key

The TACACS client on the switch and the TACACS server should have the
same shared secret key. If this key is incorrect, the following message
is printed to `syslog`:

    2017-09-05T19:57:00.356520+00:00 leaf01 sshd[3176]: nss_tacplus: TACACS+ server 192.168.0.254:49 read failed with protocol error (incorrect shared secret?) user cumulus 

### Issues with Per-command Authorization

To debug TACACS user command authorization, have the TACACS+ user enter
the following command at a shell prompt, then try the command again:

    tacuser0@switch:~$ export TACACSAUTHDEBUG=1

When this debugging is enabled, additional information is shown for the
command authorization conversation with the TACACS+ server:

    tacuser0@switch:~$ net pending
    tacplus-auth: found matching command (/usr/bin/net) request authorization
    tacplus-auth: error connecting to 10.0.3.195:49 to request authorization for net: Transport endpoint is not connected
    tacplus-auth: cmd not authorized (16)
    tacplus-auth: net not authorized from 192.168.3.189:49

### Debug Issues with Accounting Records

If you have added or deleted TACACS+ servers from the configuration
files, make sure you notify the `audisp` plugin with this command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo killall -HUP audisp-tacplus

If accounting records are still not being sent, add *debug=1* to the
` /etc/audisp/audisp-tac_plus.conf  `file, then issue the command above
to notify the plugin. Ask the TACACS+ user to run a command and examine
the end of `/var/log/syslog` for messages from the plugin. You can also
check the auditing log file `/var/log/audit/audit.log` to be sure the
auditing records are being written. If they are not, restart the audit
daemon with:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart auditd.service

## Limitations

### TACACS+ Client Is only Supported through the Management Interface

The TACACS+ client is only supported through the management interface on
the switch: eth0, eth1, or the VRF management interface. The TACACS+
client is not supported through bonds, switch virtual interfaces (SVIs),
or switch port interfaces (swp).

### Multiple TACACS+ Users

If two or more TACACS+ users are logged in simultaneously with the same
privilege level, while the accounting records are maintained correctly,
a lookup on either name will match both users, while a UID lookup will
only return the user that logged in first.

This means that any processes run by either user will be attributed to
both, and all files created by either user will be attributed to the
first name matched. This is similar to adding two local users to the
password file with the same UID and GID, and is an inherent limitation
of using the UID for the base user from the password file.

{{%notice note%}}

The current algorithm returns the first name matching the UID from the
mapping file; this can be the first or the second user that logged in.

{{%/notice%}}

To work around this issue, you can use the switch audit log or the
TACACS server accounting logs to determine which processes and files are
created by each user.

  - For commands that do not execute other commands (for example,
    changes to configurations in an editor, or actions with tools like
    `clagctl` and `vtysh`), no additional accounting is done.

  - Per-command authorization is implemented at the most basic level
    (commands are permitted or denied based on the standard Linux user
    permissions for the local TACACS users and only privilege level 15
    users can run `sudo` commands by default).

The Linux `auditd` system does not always generate audit events for
processes when terminated with a signal (with the `kill` system call or
internal errors such as SIGSEGV). As a result, processes that exit on a
signal that is not caught and handled, might not generate a STOP
accounting record.

### Issues with deluser Command

TACACS+ and other non-local users that run the `deluser` command with
the `--remove-home` option will see an error about not finding the user
in `/etc/passwd`:

    tacuser0@switch: deluser --remove-home USERNAME
    userdel: cannot remove entry ‘USERNAME’ from /etc/passwd
    /usr/sbin/deluser: `/usr/sbin/userdel USERNAME' returned error code 1. Exiting

However, the command does remove the home directory. The user can still
log in on that account, but will not have a valid home directory. This
is a known upstream issue with the `deluser` command for all non-local
users.

Only use the `--remove-home` option when the `user_homedir=1`
configuration command is in use.

### When Both TACACS+ and RADIUS AAA Clients are Installed

When you have both the TACACS+ and the RADIUS AAA client installed, RADIUS login is not attempted. As a workaround, do not install both the TACACS+ and the RADIUS AAA client on the same switch.
