On Broadcom switches, a MAC address is learned on a bridge regardless of whether or not a received packet is dropped by an [ACL](../../Netfilter-ACLs/). This is due to how the hardware learns MAC addresses and occurs before the ACL lookup. This can be a security or resource problem as the MAC address table has the potential to get filled with bogus MAC addresses; a malfunctioning host, network error, loop, or malicious attack on a shared layer 2 platform can create an outage for other hosts if the same MAC address is learned on another port.

To prevent this from happening, Cumulus Linux filters frames before MAC learning occurs. Because MAC addresses and their port/VLAN associations are known at configuration time, you can create static MAC addresses, then create ingress ACLs to whitelist traffic from these MAC addresses and drop traffic otherwise.

This feature is specific to switches on the Broadcom platform only; on switches with Mellanox Spectrum ASICs, the input port ACL does not have these issues when learning MAC addresses.

Create a configuration similar to the following, where you associate a port and VLAN with a given MAC address, adding each one to the bridge:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge vids 100,200,300
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge pvid 1
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge ports swp1-3
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:11 dev swp1 master static vlan 100
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:22 dev swp2 master static vlan 200
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:33 dev swp3 master static vlan 300
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

These commands create the following configuration in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

```
auto swp1
iface swp1

auto swp2
iface swp2

auto swp3
iface swp3

auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3
    bridge-pvid 1
    bridge-vids 100 200 300
    bridge-vlan-aware yes
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:11 dev swp1 master static vlan 100
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:22 dev swp2 master static vlan 200
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:33 dev swp3 master static vlan 300
```

If you need to list many MAC addresses, you can run a script to create the same configuration. For example, create a script called `macs.txt` and put in the `bridge fdb add` commands for each MAC address you need to configure:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/networks/macs.txt
#!/bin/bash
bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:11 dev swp1 master static vlan 100
bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:22 dev swp2 master static vlan 200
bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:33 dev swp3 master static vlan 300
bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:44 dev swp4 master static vlan 400
bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:55 dev swp5 master static vlan 500
bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:66 dev swp6 master static vlan 600
```

Then create the configuration using [NCLU](../../Network-Command-Line-Utility-NCLU/):

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge vids 100,200,300
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge pvid 1
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge ports swp1-3
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge pre-up /etc/networks/macs.txt
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

These commands create the following configuration in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

```
auto swp1
iface swp1

auto swp2
iface swp2

auto swp3
iface swp3

auto swp4
iface swp4

auto swp5
iface swp5

auto swp6
iface swp6

auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3 swp4 swp5 swp6
    bridge-pvid 1
    bridge-vids 100 200 300
    bridge-vlan-aware yes
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:11 dev swp1 master static vlan 100
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:22 dev swp2 master static vlan 200
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:33 dev swp3 master static vlan 300
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:44 dev swp4 master static vlan 400
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:55 dev swp5 master static vlan 500
    pre-up bridge fdb add 00:00:00:00:00:66 dev swp6 master static vlan 600
```

## Interactions with EVPN

If you are using [EVPN](../../../Network-Virtualization/Ethernet-Virtual-Private-Network-EVPN/), local static MAC addresses added to the local FDB are exported as static MAC addresses to remote switches. Remote MAC addresses are added as MAC addresses to the remote FDB.
