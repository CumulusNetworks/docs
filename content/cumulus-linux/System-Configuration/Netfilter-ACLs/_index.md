[Netfilter](http://www.netfilter.org/) is the packet filtering framework
in Cumulus Linux as well as most other Linux distributions. There are a
number of tools available for configuring ACLs in Cumulus Linux:

  - `iptables`, `ip6tables`, and `ebtables` are Linux userspace tools
    used to administer filtering rules for IPv4 packets, IPv6 packets,
    and Ethernet frames (layer 2 using MAC addresses).
  - [NCLU](../Network-Command-Line-Utility-NCLU)
    is a Cumulus Linux-specific userspace tool used to configure custom
    ACLs.
  - `cl-acltool` is a Cumulus Linux-specific userspace tool used to
    administer filtering rules and configure default ACLs.

NCLU and `cl-acltool` operate on various configuration files and use
`iptables`, `ip6tables`, and `ebtables` to install rules into the
kernel. In addition, NCLU and `cl-acltool` program rules in hardware for
interfaces involving switch port interfaces, which `iptables`,
`ip6tables` and `ebtables` cannot do on their own.

{{%notice note%}}

In many instances, you can use NCLU to configure ACLs; however, in some
cases, you must use `cl-acltool`. The examples below specify when to use
which tool.

    cumulus@leaf01:~$ net example acl

    Scenario
    ========
    We would like to use access-lists on 'switch' to
    - Restrict inbound traffic on swp1 to traffic from 10.1.1.0/24 destined for 10.1.2.0/24
    - Restrict outbound traffic on swp2 to http, https, or ssh


         \*switch
            /\
      swp1 /  \ swp2
          /    \
         /      \
     host-11   host-12



    switch net commands
    ====================

    Create an ACL that accepts traffic from 10.1.1.0/24 destined for 10.1.2.0/24
    and drops all other traffic

    switch# net add acl ipv4 MYACL accept source-ip 10.1.1.0/24 dest-ip 10.1.2.0/24
    switch# net add acl ipv4 MYACL drop source-ip any dest-ip any

    Apply MYACL inbound on swp1

    switch# net add interface swp1 acl ipv4 MYACL inbound

    Create an ACL that accepts http, https, or ssh traffic and drops all
    other traffic.

    switch# net add acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH accept tcp source-ip any source-port any dest-ip any dest-port http
    switch# net add acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH accept tcp source-ip any source-port http dest-ip any dest-port any
    switch# net add acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH accept tcp source-ip any source-port any dest-ip any dest-port https
    switch# net add acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH accept tcp source-ip any source-port https dest-ip any dest-port any
    switch# net add acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH accept tcp source-ip any source-port any dest-ip any dest-port ssh
    switch# net add acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH accept tcp source-ip any source-port ssh dest-ip any dest-port any
    switch# net add acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH drop source-ip any dest-ip any

    Apply WEB_OR_SSH outbound on swp2
    switch# net add interface swp2 acl ipv4 WEB_OR_SSH outbound

    commit the staged changes
    switch# net commit

    Verification
    ============
    switch# net show configuration acl

## Traffic Rules In Cumulus Linux

### Chains

Netfilter describes the mechanism for which packets are classified and
controlled in the Linux kernel. Cumulus Linux uses the Netfilter
framework to control the flow of traffic to, from, and across the
switch. Netfilter does not require a separate software daemon to run; it
is part of the Linux kernel itself. Netfilter asserts policies at layers
2, 3 and 4 of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
by inspecting packet and frame headers based on a list of rules. Rules
are defined using syntax provided by the `iptables`, `ip6tables` and
`ebtables` userspace applications.

The rules created by these programs inspect or operate on packets at
several points in the life of the packet through the system. These five
points are known as *chains* and are shown here:

{{% imgOld 0 %}}

The chains and their uses are:

- **PREROUTING** touches packets before they are routed
- **INPUT** touches packets after they are determined to be destined
  for the local system but before they are received by the control
  plane software
- **FORWARD** touches transit traffic as it moves through the box
- **OUTPUT** touches packets that are sourced by the control plane
  software before they are put on the wire
- **POSTROUTING** touches packets immediately before they are put on
  the wire but after the routing decision has been made

### Tables

When building rules to affect the flow of traffic, the individual chains
can be accessed by *tables*. Linux provides three tables by default:

- **Filter** classifies traffic or filters traffic
- **NAT** applies Network Address Translation rules

    {{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux does not support NAT.

    {{%/notice%}}

- **Mangle** alters packets as they move through the switch

Each table has a set of default chains that can be used to modify or
inspect packets at different points of the path through the switch.
Chains contain the individual rules to influence traffic. Each table and
the default chains they support are shown below. Tables and chains in
green are supported by Cumulus Linux, those in red are not supported
(that is, they are not hardware accelerated) at this time.

{{% imgOld 1 %}}

{{% imgOld 2 %}}

{{% imgOld 3 %}}

### Rules

Rules are the items that actually classify traffic to be acted upon.
Rules are applied to chains, which are attached to tables, similar to
the graphic below.

{{% imgOld 4 %}}

Rules have several different components; the examples below highlight
those different components.

{{% imgOld 5 %}}

  - **Table:** The first argument is the *table*. Notice the second
    example does not specify a table, that is because the filter table
    is implied if a table is not specified.
  - **Chain:** The second argument is the *chain*. Each table supports
    several different chains. See Understanding Tables above.
  - **Matches:** The third argument(s) are called the *matches*. You can
    specify multiple matches in a single rule. However, the more matches
    you use in a rule, the more memory that rule consumes.
  - **Jump:** The *jump* specifies the target of the rule; that is, what
    action to take if the packet matches the rule. If this option is
    omitted in a rule, then matching the rule will have no effect on the
    packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented.
  - **Target(s):** The *target* can be a user-defined chain (other than
    the one this rule is in), one of the special built-in targets that
    decides the fate of the packet immediately (like DROP), or an
    extended target. See the
    [Supported Rule Types and Common Usages](#supported-rule-types) section 
    below for examples of different targets.

### How Rules Are Parsed and Applied

All the rules from each chain are read from `iptables`, `ip6tables`, and
`ebtables` and entered in order into either the filter table or the
mangle table. The rules are read from the kernel in the following order:

- IPv6 (`ip6tables`)
- IPv4 (`iptables`)
- `ebtables`

When rules are combined and put into one table, the order determines the
relative priority of the rules; `iptables` and `ip6tables` have the
highest precedence and `ebtables` has the lowest.

The Linux packet forwarding construct is an overlay for how the silicon
underneath processes packets. Be aware of the following:

- The order of operations for how rules are processed is not perfectly
    maintained when you compare how `iptables` and the switch silicon
    process packets. The switch silicon reorders rules when `switchd`
    writes to the ASIC, whereas traditional `iptables` execute the list
    of rules in order.
- All rules are terminating; after a rule matches, the action is
    carried out and no more rules are processed. The exception to this
    is when a SETCLASS rule is placed immediately before another rule;
    this exists multiple times in the default ACL configuration.  
    In the example below, the SETCLASS action applied with the
    `--in-interface` option, creates the internal ASIC classification,
    and **continues to process** the next rule, which does the
    rate-limiting for the matched protocol:

        -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p udp --dport $BFD_ECHO_PORT -j SETCLASS --class 7
        -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_ECHO_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000

    {{%notice warning%}}

  If multiple contiguous rules with the same match criteria are
  applied to `--in-interface`, **only** the first rule gets processed
  and then terminates processing. This is a misconfiguration; there is
  no reason to have duplicate rules with different actions.

    {{%/notice%}}

- When processing traffic, rules affecting the FORWARD chain that
    specify an ingress interface are performed prior to rules that match
    on an egress interface. As a workaround, rules that only affect the
    egress interface can have an ingress interface wildcard (currently,
    only *swp+* and *bond+* are supported as wildcard names; see below)
    that matches any interface applied so that you can maintain order of
    operations with other input interface rules. For example, with the
    following rules:

        -A FORWARD -i $PORTA -j ACCEPT
        -A FORWARD -o $PORTA -j ACCEPT   <-- This rule is performed LAST (because of egress interface matching)
        -A FORWARD -i $PORTB -j DROP

    If you modify the rules like this, they are performed in order:

        -A FORWARD -i $PORTA -j ACCEPT
        -A FORWARD -i swp+ -o $PORTA -j ACCEPT   <-- These rules are performed in order (because of wildcard match on ingress interface)
        -A FORWARD -i $PORTB -j DROP

- When using rules that do a mangle and a filter lookup for a packet,
    Cumulus Linux processes them in parallel and combines the action.
- If a switch port is assigned to a bond, any egress rules must be
    assigned to the bond.
- When using the OUTPUT chain, rules must be assigned to the source.
    For example, if a rule is assigned to the switch port in the
    direction of traffic but the source is a bridge (VLAN), the traffic
    is not affected by the rule and must be applied to the bridge.
- If all transit traffic needs to have a rule applied, use the FORWARD
    chain, not the OUTPUT chain.
- `ebtable` rules are put into either the IPv4 or IPv6 memory space
    depending on whether the rule utilizes IPv4 or IPv6 to make a
    decision. Layer 2-only rules that match the MAC address are put into
    the IPv4 memory space.

{{%notice note%}}

On Broadcom switches, the ingress INPUT chain rules match layer 2 and
layer 3 multicast packets **before** multicast packet replication has
occurred; therefore, a DROP rule affects all copies.

{{%/notice%}}

### Rule Placement in Memory

INPUT and ingress (`FORWARD -i`) rules occupy the same memory space. A
rule counts as ingress if the `-i` option is set. If both input and
output options (`-i` and `-o`) are set, the rule is considered as
ingress and occupies that memory space. For example:

    -A FORWARD -i swp1 -o swp2 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT

{{%notice note%}}

If you set an output flag with the INPUT chain, you see an error. For
example, running `cl-acltool -i` on the following rule:

    -A FORWARD,INPUT -i swp1 -o swp2 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT

generates the following error:

    error: line 2 : output interface specified with INPUT chain error processing rule '-A FORWARD,INPUT -i swp1 -o swp2 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT'

However, removing the `-o` option and interface make it a valid rule.

{{%/notice%}}

### Nonatomic Update Mode and Update Mode

In Cumulus Linux, *update mode* is enabled by default. However, this
mode limits the number of ACL rules that you can configure.

{{% imgOld 6 %}}

To increase the number of ACL rules that can be configured, configure
the switch to operate in *nonatomic mode*.

{{% imgOld 7 %}}

Instead of reserving 50% of your TCAM space for atomic updates,
incremental update uses the available free space to write the new TCAM
rules and swap over to the new rules after this is complete. Cumulus
Linux then deletes the old rules and frees up the original TCAM space.
If there is insufficient free space to complete this task, the original
nonatomic update is performed, which interrupts traffic.

{{% imgOld 8 %}}

{{% imgOld 9 %}}

#### Enable Nonatomic Update Mode

You can enable nonatomic updates for `switchd`, which offer better
scaling because all TCAM resources are used to actively impact traffic.
With atomic updates, half of the hardware resources are on standby and
do not actively impact traffic.

*Incremental nonatomic updates* are table based, so they do not
interrupt network traffic when new rules are installed. The rules are
mapped into the following tables and are updated in this order:

  - mirror (ingress only)
  - ipv4-mac (can be both ingress and egress)
  - ipv6 (ingress only)

{{%notice warning%}}

Only Broadcom-based switches support incremental nonatomic updates.
Mellanox-based switches do **not** support incremental updates;
therefore traffic **is** affected and gets stopped.

{{%/notice%}}

The incremental nonatomic update operation follows this order:

1.  Updates are performed incrementally, one table at a time without
    stopping traffic.

2.  Cumulus Linux checks if the rules in a table have changed since the
    last time they were installed; if a table does not have any changes,
    it is not reinstalled.

3.  If there are changes in a table, the new rules are populated in new
    groups or slices in hardware, then that table is switched over to
    the new groups or slices.

4.  Finally, old resources for that table are freed. This process is
    repeated for each of the tables listed above.

5.  If sufficient resources do not exist to hold both the new rule set
    and old rule set, the regular nonatomic mode is attempted. This
    interrupts network traffic.

6.  If the regular nonatomic update fails, Cumulus Linux reverts back to
    the previous rules.

To always start `switchd` with nonatomic updates:

1.  Edit `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf`.

2.  Add the following line to the file:

        acl.non_atomic_update_mode = TRUE

3.  Restart `switchd`:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart switchd.service

{{%notice note%}}

During regular *non-incremental nonatomic updates*, traffic is stopped
first, then enabled after the new configuration is written into the
hardware completely.

{{%/notice%}}

### Use iptables, ip6tables, and ebtables Directly

Using `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `ebtables` directly is not
recommended because any rules installed in these cases only are applied
to the Linux kernel and are not hardware accelerated using
synchronization to the switch silicon. Running `cl-acltool -i` (the
installation command) resets all rules and deletes anything that is not
stored in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`.

For example, performing:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP

Appears to work, and the rule appears when you run `cl-acltool -L`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -L ip
    -------------------------------
    Listing rules of type iptables:
    -------------------------------
     
    TABLE filter :
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 72 packets, 5236 bytes)
    pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
    0 0 DROP icmp -- any any anywhere anywhere icmp echo-request

However, the rule is not synced to hardware when applied in this way and
running `cl-acltool -i` or `reboot` removes the rule without replacing
it. To ensure all rules that can be in hardware are hardware
accelerated, place them in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf` and install
them by running `cl-acltool -i`.

### Estimate the Number of Rules

To estimate the number of rules you can create from an ACL entry, first
determine if that entry is an ingress or an egress. Then, determine if
it is an IPv4-mac or IPv6 type rule. This determines the slice to which
the rule belongs. Use the following to determine how many entries are
used up for each type.

By default, each entry occupies one double wide entry, except if the
entry is one of the following:

  - An entry with multiple comma-separated input interfaces is split
    into one rule for each input interface (listed after
    `--in-interface` below). For example, this entry splits into two
    rules:

        -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1s0,swp1s1 -p icmp -j ACCEPT

  - An entry with multiple comma-separated output interfaces is split
    into one rule for each output interface (listed after
    `--out-interface` below). This entry splits into two rules:

        -A FORWARD --in-interface swp+ --out-interface swp1s0,swp1s1 -p icmp -j ACCEPT

  - An entry with both input and output comma-separated interfaces is
    split into one rule for each combination of input and output
    interface (listed after `--in-interface` and `--out-interface`
    below). This entry splits into four rules:

        -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1s0,swp1s1 --out-interface swp1s2,swp1s3 -p icmp -j ACCEPT

  - An entry with multiple layer 4 port ranges is split into one rule
    for each range (listed after `--dport` below). For example, this
    entry splits into two rules:

        -A FORWARD --in-interface swp+ -p tcp -m multiport --dport 1050:1051,1055:1056 -j ACCEPT

    {{%notice note%}}

  Port ranges are only allowed for ingress rules.

    {{%/notice%}}

### Match SVI and Bridged Interfaces in Rules

Cumulus Linux supports matching ACL rules for both ingress and egress
interfaces on both
[VLAN-aware](../../Layer-2/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode)
and [traditional
mode](../../Layer-2/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/Traditional-Bridge-Mode)
bridges, including bridge SVIs ([switch VLAN
interfaces](../../Layer-2/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/#configure-an-svi-(switch-vlan-interface))
for input and output. However, keep the following in mind:

  - If a traditional mode bridge has a mix of different VLANs, or has
    both access and trunk members, output interface matching is not
    supported.
  - For `iptables` rules, all IP packets in a bridge are matched, not
    just routed packets.
  - You cannot match both input and output interfaces in a rule.
  - For routed packets, Cumulus Linux cannot match the output bridge for
    SPAN/ERSPAN.
  - Matching SVI interfaces in `ebtable` rules is supported on switches
    based on Broadcom ASICs. This feature is not currently supported on
    switches with Mellanox Spectrum ASICs.

Following are example rules for a VLAN-aware bridge:

    [ebtables]
    -A FORWARD -i br0.100 -p IPv4 --ip-protocol icmp -j DROP
    -A FORWARD -o br0.100 -p IPv4 --ip-protocol icmp -j ACCEPT
     
    [iptables]
    -A FORWARD -i br0.100 -p icmp -j DROP
    -A FORWARD --out-interface br0.100 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD --in-interface br0.100 -j POLICE --set-mode  pkt  --set-rate  1 --set-burst 1 --set-class 0

And here are example rules for a traditional mode bridge:

    [ebtables]
    -A FORWARD -i br0 -p IPv4 --ip-protocol icmp -j DROP
    -A FORWARD -o br0 -p IPv4 --ip-protocol icmp -j ACCEPT
     
     
    [iptables]
    -A FORWARD -i br0 -p icmp -j DROP
    -A FORWARD --out-interface br0 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD --in-interface br0 -j POLICE --set-mode  pkt  --set-rate  1 --set-burst 1 --set-class 0

### Match on VLAN IDs on Layer 2 Interfaces

Cumulus Linux 3.7.9 and later enables you to match on VLAN IDs on layer 2 interfaces for ingress rules.

{{%notice note%}}

Matching VLAN IDs on layer 2 interfaces is supported on switches with
[Spectrum ASICs](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?asic%5B0%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum&asic%5B1%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum_A1) only.

{{%/notice%}}

The following example matches on a VLAN and DSCP class, and sets the internal class of the packet:

This can be combined with ingress iptable rules for extended matching on IP fields.

```
[ebtables]
-A FORWARD -p 802_1Q --vlan-id 100 -j mark --mark-set 0x66

[iptables]
-A FORWARD -i swp31 -m mark --mark 0x66 -m dscp --dscp-class CS1 -j SETCLASS --class 2
```

## Install and Manage ACL Rules with NCLU

NCLU provides an easy way to create custom ACLs in Cumulus Linux. The
rules you create live in the `/var/lib/cumulus/nclu/nclu_acl.conf` file,
which gets converted to a rules file,
`/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/50_nclu_acl.rules`. This way, the rules you
create with NCLU are independent of the two default files in
`/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/``00control_plane.rules` and
`99control_plane_catch_all.rules`, as the content in these files might
get updated after you upgrade Cumulus Linux.

Instead of crafting a rule by hand then installing it using
`cl-acltool`, NCLU handles many of the options automatically. For
example, consider the following `iptables` rule:

    -A FORWARD -i swp1 -o swp2 -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT

You create this rule, called *EXAMPLE1*, using NCLU like this:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 accept tcp source-ip 10.0.14.2/32 source-port any dest-ip 10.0.15.8/32 dest-port any
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

All options, such as the `-j` and `-p`, even `FORWARD` in the above
rule, are added automatically when you apply the rule to the control
plane; NCLU figures it all out for you.

You can also set a priority value, which specifies the order in which
the rules get executed and the order in which they appear in the rules
file. Lower numbers are executed first. To add a new rule in the middle,
first run `net show config acl`, which displays the priority numbers.
Otherwise, new rules get appended to the end of the list of rules in the
`nclu_acl.conf` and `50_nclu_acl.rules` files.

{{%notice note%}}

If you need to hand edit a rule, do not edit the `50_nclu_acl.rules`
file. Instead, edit the `nclu_acl.conf` file.

{{%/notice%}}

After you add the rule, you need to apply it to an inbound or outbound
interface using `net add int acl`. The inbound interface in our example
is swp1:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add int swp1 acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

After you commit your changes, you can verify the rule you created with
NCLU by running `net show configuration acl`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show configuration acl
    acl ipv4 EXAMPLEv4 priority 10 accept tcp source-ip 10.0.14.2/32 source-port any dest-ip 10.0.15.8/32 dest-port any
     
    interface swp1
      acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound

Or you can see all of the rules installed by running `cat` on the
`50_nclu_acl.rules` file:

    cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/50_nclu_acl.rules
    [iptables]
    # swp1: acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound
    -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 --out-interface swp2 -j ACCEPT -p tcp -s 10.0.14.2/32 -d 10.0.15.8/32 --dport 110

For INPUT and FORWARD rules, apply the rule to a control plane interface
using `net add control-plane`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add control-plane acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1 inbound
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

To remove a rule, use `net del acl ipv4|ipv6|mac RULENAME`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net del acl ipv4 EXAMPLE1
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

This deletes all rules from the `50_nclu_acl.rules` file with that name.
It also deletes the interfaces referenced in the `nclu_acl.conf` file.

## Install and Manage ACL Rules with cl-acltool

You can manage Cumulus Linux ACLs with `cl-acltool`. Rules are first
written to the `iptables` chains, as described above, and then synced to
hardware via `switchd`.

{{%notice note%}}

Use `iptables`/`ip6tables`/`ebtables` and `cl-acltool` to manage rules
in the default files, `00control_plane.rules` and
`99control_plane_catch_all.rules`; they are not aware of rules created
using NCLU.

{{%/notice%}}

To examine the current state of chains and list all installed rules,
run:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -L all
    -------------------------------
    Listing rules of type iptables:
    -------------------------------
     
    TABLE filter :
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 90 packets, 14456 bytes)
    pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
    0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any 240.0.0.0/5 anywhere
    0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any loopback/8 anywhere
    0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any base-address.mcast.net/8 anywhere
    0 0 DROP all -- swp+ any 255.255.255.255 anywhere ...

To list installed rules using native `iptables`, `ip6tables` and
`ebtables`, use the `-L` option with the respective commands:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo iptables -L
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ip6tables -L
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ebtables -L

To flush all installed rules, run:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -F all

To flush only the IPv4 `iptables` rules, run:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -F ip

If the install fails, ACL rules in the kernel and hardware are rolled
back to the previous state. Errors from programming rules in the kernel
or ASIC are reported appropriately.

## Install Packet Filtering (ACL) Rules

`cl-acltool` takes access control list (ACL) rules input in files. Each
ACL policy file contains `iptables`, `ip6tables` and `ebtables`
categories under the tags `[iptables]`, `[ip6tables]` and `[ebtables]`
respectively.

Each rule in an ACL policy must be assigned to one of the rule
categories above.

See `man cl-acltool(5)` for ACL rule details. For `iptables` rule
syntax, see `man iptables(8)`. For `ip6tables` rule syntax, see `man
ip6tables(8)`. For `ebtables` rule syntax, see `man ebtables(8)`.

See `man cl-acltool(5)` and `man cl-acltool(8)` for further details on
using `cl-acltool`. Some examples are listed here and more are listed
later in this chapter.

{{%notice note%}}

By default:

  - ACL policy files are located in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/`.
  - All `*.rules` files in this directory are included in
    `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`.
  - All files included in this `policy.conf` file are installed when the
    switch boots up.
  - The `policy.conf` file expects rules files to have a `.rules` suffix
    as part of the file name.

{{%/notice%}}

Here is an example ACL policy file:

    [iptables]
    -A INPUT --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
     
    [ip6tables]
    -A INPUT --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

    [ebtables]
    -A INPUT -p IPv4 -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD -p IPv4 -j ACCEPT

You can use wildcards or variables to specify chain and interface lists
to ease administration of rules.

{{%notice note%}}

**Interface Wildcards**

Currently only *swp+* and *bond+* are supported as wildcard names. There
might be kernel restrictions in supporting more complex wildcards likes
*swp1+ etc*.

swp+ rules are applied as an aggregate, *not* per port. If you want to apply per port policing, specify a specific port instead of a wildcard.

{{%/notice%}}

    INGRESS = swp+
    INPUT_PORT_CHAIN = INPUT,FORWARD
     
    [iptables]
    -A $INPUT_PORT_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

    [ip6tables]
    -A $INPUT_PORT_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
     
    [ebtables]
    -A INPUT -p IPv4 -j ACCEPT

You can write ACL rules for the system into multiple files under the
default `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/` directory. The ordering of rules
during installation follows the sort order of the files based on their
file names.

Use multiple files to stack rules. The example below shows two rules
files separating rules for management and datapath traffic:

    cumulus@switch:~$ ls /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/ 
    00sample_mgmt.rules 01sample_datapath.rules
    cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/00sample_mgmt.rules

    INGRESS_INTF = swp+
    INGRESS_CHAIN = INPUT

    [iptables]
    # protect the switch management
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 10.0.14.2 -d 10.0.15.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 10.0.11.2 -d 10.0.12.8 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -d 10.0.16.8 -p udp -j DROP
     
    cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01sample_datapath.rules
    INGRESS_INTF = swp+
    INGRESS_CHAIN = INPUT, FORWARD
     
    [iptables]
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 192.0.2.5 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 192.0.2.6 -d 192.0.2.4 -j DROP
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -s 192.0.2.2 -d 192.0.2.8 -j DROP

Install all ACL policies under a directory:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -i -P ./rules
    Reading files under rules
    Reading rule file ./rules/01_http_rules.txt ...
    Processing rules in file ./rules/01_http_rules.txt ...
    Installing acl policy ...
    Done.

Install all rules and policies included in
`/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -i

## Specify the Policy Files to Install

By default, Cumulus Linux installs any `.rules` file you configure in
`/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/`. To add other policy files to an ACL, you
need to include them in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`. For example, for
Cumulus Linux to install a rule in a policy file called
`01_new.datapathacl`, add `include
/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01_new.rules` to `policy.conf`, as in this
example:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf
     
    #
    # This file is a master file for acl policy file inclusion
    #
    # Note: This is not a file where you list acl rules.
    #
    # This file can contain:
    # - include lines with acl policy files
    #   example:
    #     include <filepath>
    #
    # see manpage cl-acltool(5) and cl-acltool(8) for how to write policy files
    #
     
    include /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01_new.datapathacl

## Hardware Limitations on Number of Rules

The maximum number of rules that can be handled in hardware is a
function of the following factors:

  - The platform type (switch silicon, like Tomahawk or Spectrum — see
    the [HCL](http://cumulusnetworks.com/support/hcl) to determine which
    platform type applies to a particular switch).
  - The mix of IPv4 and IPv6 rules; Cumulus Linux does not support the
    maximum number of rules for both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
  - The number of default rules provided by Cumulus Linux.
  - Whether the rules are applied on ingress or egress.
  - Whether the rules are in atomic or nonatomic mode; nonatomic mode
    rules are used when nonatomic updates are enabled ([see
    above](#nonatomic-update-mode-and-update-mode)).

If the maximum number of rules for a particular table is exceeded,
`cl-acltool -i` generates the following error:

    error: hw sync failed (sync_acl hardware installation failed) Rolling back .. failed.

In the tables below, the default rules count toward the limits listed.
The raw limits below assume only one ingress and one egress table are
present.

### Mellanox Spectrum Limits

The Mellanox Spectrum ASIC has one common
[TCAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_memory#Ternary_CAMs)
for both ingress and egress, which can be used for other non-ACL-related
resources. However, the number of supported rules varies with the [TCAM
profile](../../Layer-3/Routing#tcam-resource-profiles-for -spectrum-switches) specified for the
switch.

| Profile      | Atomic Mode IPv4 Rules | Atomic Mode IPv6 Rules | Nonatomic Mode IPv4 Rules | Nonatomic Mode IPv6 Rules |

{{%notice note%}}

Even though the table above specifies that zero IPv6 rules are supported
with the ip-acl-heavy profile, Cumulus Networks does not prevent you
from configuring IPv6 rules. However, there is no guarantee that IPv6
rules work under the ip-acl-heavy profile.

{{%/notice%}}

## Supported Rule Types

The `iptables`/`ip6tables`/`ebtables` construct tries to layer the Linux
implementation on top of the underlying hardware but they are not always
directly compatible. Here are the supported rules for chains in
`iptables`, `ip6tables` and `ebtables`.

### Other Unsupported Rules

  - Rules that have no matches and accept all packets in a chain are
    currently ignored.

  - Chain default rules (that are ACCEPT) are also ignored.

### IPv6 Egress Rules on Broadcom Switches

Cumulus Linux 3.7.2 and later supports IPv6 egress rules in `ip6tables`
on Broadcom switches. Because there are no slices to allocate in the
egress TCAM for IPv6, the matches are implemented using a combination of
the ingress IPv6 slice and the existing egress IPv4 MAC slice:

- Cumulus Linux compares all the match fields in the IPv6 ingress
    slice, except the `--out-interface` field, and marks the packet with
    a `classid.`
- The egress IPv4 MAC slice matches on the `classid` and the
    `out-interface`, and performs the actions.

    For example, the `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan100 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`
rule is split into the following:
- IPv6 ingress: `-A FORWARD -p icmp6` → action mark (for example,
    `classid 4`)
- IPv4 MAC egress: `<match mark 4>` and `--out-interface vlan100 -j
    ACCEPT`

{{%notice note%}}

  - IPv6 egress rules in `ip6tables` are not supported on Hurricane2
    switches.
  - You cannot match both input and output interfaces in the same rule.
  - The egress TCAM IPv4 MAC slice is shared with other rules, which
    constrains the scale to a much lower limit.

{{%/notice%}}

#### Caveats

Splitting rules across the ingress TCAM and the egress TCAM causes the
ingress IPv6 part of the rule to match packets going to all
destinations, which can interfere with the regular expected linear rule
match in a sequence.

A higher rule can prevent a lower rule from being matched unexpectedly:</p>

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan100 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 2: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan101 -p icmp6 -s 01::02 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 1 matches all icmp6 packets from to all out interfaces in the ingress TCAM. This
prevents rule 2 from getting matched, which is more specific but with a different out interface.

Make sure to put more specific matches above more general matches even if the output interfaces are different.

When you have two rules with the same output interface, the lower rule might match unexpectedly depending on the presence of the previous rules.

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan100 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`
Rule 2: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan101 -s 00::01 -j DROP`
Rule 3: `-A FORWARD --out -interface vlan101 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 3 still matches for an icmp6 packet with sip 00:01 going out of vlan101. Rule 1 interferes with the normal function of rule 2 and/or rule 3.

When you have two adjacent rules with the same match and different output interfaces, such as:

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan100 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 2: `-A FORWARD --out-interface vlan101 -p icmp6 -j DROP`

Rule 2 will never be match on ingress. Both rules share the same mark.

#### Matching Untagged Packets (Trident3 Switches)

Untagged packets do not have an associated VLAN to match on egress;
therefore, the match must be on the underlying layer 2 port. For
example, for a bridge configured with pvid 100, member port swp1s0 and
swp1s1, and SVI vlan100, the output interface match on vlan100 has to be
expanded into each member port. The `-A FORWARD -o vlan100 -p icmp6 -j
ACCEPT` rule must be specified as two rules:

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD -o swp1s0 -p icmp6 -J ACCEPT`

Rule 2: `-A FORWARD -o swp1s1 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Matching on an egress port matches all packets egressing the port,
tagged as well as untagged. Therefore, to match only untagged traffic on
the port, you must specify additional rules above this rule to prevent
tagged packets matching the rule. This is true for bridge member ports
as well as regular layer 2 ports. In the example rule above, if vlan101
is also present on the bridge, add a rule above rule 1 and rule 2 to
protect vlan101 tagged traffic:

Rule 0: `-A FORWARD -o vlan101 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD -o swp1s0 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 2: `-A FORWARD -o swp1s1 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

For a standalone port or subinterface on swp1s2:

Rule 0: `-A FORWARD -o swp1s2.101 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

Rule 1: `-A FORWARD -o swp1s2 -p icmp6 -j ACCEPT`

## Common Examples

### Control Plane and Data Plane Traffic

You can configure quality of service for traffic on both the control
plane and the data plane. By using QoS policers, you can rate limit
traffic so incoming packets get dropped if they exceed specified
thresholds.

{{%notice note%}}

Counters on POLICE ACL rules in `iptables` do not currently show the
packets that are dropped due to those rules.

{{%/notice%}}

Use the `POLICE` target with `iptables`. `POLICE` takes these arguments:

- `--set-class value` sets the system internal class of service queue
    configuration to *value*.
- `--set-rate value` specifies the maximum rate in kilobytes (KB) or
    packets.
- `--set-burst value` specifies the number of packets or kilobytes
    (KB) allowed to arrive sequentially.
- `--set-mode string` sets the mode in *KB* (kilobytes) or *pkt*
    (packets) for rate and burst size.

For example, to rate limit the incoming traffic on swp1 to 400 packets
per second with a burst of 100 packets per second and set the class of
the queue for the policed traffic as 0, set this rule in your
appropriate `.rules` file:

    -A INPUT --in-interface swp1 -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 400 --set-burst 100 --set-class 0

Here is another example of control plane ACL rules to lock down the switch.
You specify them in `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/00control_plane.rules`:

### Set DSCP on Transit Traffic

The examples here use the *mangle* table to modify the packet as it
transits the switch. DSCP is expressed in 
[decimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services#Commonly_used_DSCP_values)
in the examples below.

    [iptables]
     
    #Set SSH as high priority traffic.
    -t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 22  -j DSCP --set-dscp 46
     
    #Set everything coming in SWP1 as AF13
    -t mangle -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -j DSCP --set-dscp 14
     
    #Set Packets destined for 10.0.100.27 as best effort
    -t mangle -A FORWARD -d 10.0.100.27/32 -j DSCP --set-dscp 0
     
    #Example using a range of ports for TCP traffic
    -t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 10.0.0.17/32 --sport 10000:20000 -d 10.0.100.27/32 --dport 10000:20000 -j DSCP --set-dscp 34

### Verify DSCP Values on Transit Traffic

The examples here use the DSCP match criteria in combination with other
IP, TCP, and interface matches to identify traffic and count the number
of packets.

    [iptables]
     
    #Match and count the packets that match SSH traffic with DSCP EF
    -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 22 -m dscp --dscp 46 -j ACCEPT
     
    #Match and count the packets coming in SWP1 as AF13
    -A FORWARD --in-interface swp1 -m dscp --dscp 14 -j ACCEPT
    #Match and count the packets with a destination 10.0.0.17 marked best effort
    -A FORWARD -d 10.0.100.27/32 -m dscp --dscp 0 -j ACCEPT
     
    #Match and count the packets in a port range with DSCP AF41
    -A FORWARD -p tcp -s 10.0.0.17/32 --sport 10000:20000 -d 10.0.100.27/32 --dport 10000:20000 -m dscp --dscp 34 -j ACCEPT

### Check the Packet and Byte Counters for ACL Rules

To verify the counters using the above example rules, first send test
traffic matching the patterns through the network. The following example
generates traffic with [mz](http://www.perihel.at/sec/mz/), which can be
installed on host servers or even on Cumulus Linux switches. After
traffic is sent to validate the counters, they are matched on switch1
use `cl-acltool`.

{{%notice note%}}

Policing counters do not increment on switches with the Spectrum ASIC.

### Filter Specific TCP Flags

The example solution below creates rules on the INPUT and FORWARD chains
to drop ingress IPv4 and IPv6 TCP packets when the SYN bit is set and
the RST, ACK, and FIN bits are reset. The default for the INPUT and
FORWARD chains allows all other packets. The ACL is applied to ports
swp20 and swp21. After configuring this ACL, new TCP sessions that
originate from ingress ports swp20 and swp21 are not allowed. TCP
sessions that originate from any other port are allowed.

    INGRESS_INTF = swp20,swp21
     
    [iptables]
    -A INPUT,FORWARD --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --syn -j DROP
    [ip6tables]
    -A INPUT,FORWARD --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --syn -j DROP

The `--syn` flag in the above rule matches packets with the SYN bit set
and the ACK, RST, and FIN bits are cleared. It is equivalent to using
`-tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK,FIN SYN`. For example, you can write the above
rule as:

    -A INPUT,FORWARD --in-interface $INGRESS_INTF -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK,FIN SYN -j DROP

### Control Who Can SSH into the Switch

Run the following NCLU commands to control who can SSH into the switch.
In the following example, 10.0.0.11/32 is the interface IP address (or loopback IP address) of the switch and 10.255.4.0/24 can SSH into the switch.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 test priority 10 accept source-ip 10.255.4.0/24 dest-ip 10.0.0.11/32
cumulus@switch:~$ net add acl ipv4 test priority 20 drop source-ip any dest-ip 10.0.0.11/32
cumulus@switch:~$ net add control-plane acl ipv4 test inbound
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux does not support the keyword `iprouter` (typically used for traffic sent to the CPU, where the destination MAC address is that of the router but the destination IP address is not the router).

## Example Scenario

The following
example scenario demonstrates how several different rules are applied.

{{% imgOld 10 %}}

Following are the configurations for the two switches used in these
examples. The configuration for each switch appears in
`/etc/network/interfaces` on that switch.

### Switch 1 Configuration

    cumulus@switch1:~$ net show configuration files
     
    ...
     
    /etc/network/interfaces
    =======================
     
     
    auto swp1 
    iface swp1 
     
    auto swp2 
    iface swp2 
     
    auto swp3 
    iface swp3 
     
    auto swp4 
    iface swp4 
     
    auto bond2 
    iface bond2 
        bond-slaves swp3 swp4 
     
    auto br-untagged 
    iface br-untagged 
        address 10.0.0.1/24

        bridge_stp on
     
    ...

### Switch 2 Configuration

    cumulus@switch2:~$ net show configuration files
     
    ...
     
    /etc/network/interfaces
    =======================
     
    auto swp3 
    iface swp3 
     
    auto swp4 
    iface swp4

    auto bond2 
    iface bond2 
        bond-slaves swp3 swp4 
     
    ...

### Egress Rule

The following rule blocks any TCP traffic with destination port 200
going from host1 or host2 through the switch (corresponding to rule 1 in
the diagram above).

    [iptables] -A FORWARD -o bond2 -p tcp --dport 200 -j DROP

### Ingress Rule

The following rule blocks any UDP traffic with source port 200 going
from host1 through the switch (corresponding to rule 2 in the diagram
above).

    [iptables] -A FORWARD -i swp2 -p udp --sport 200 -j DROP

### Input Rule

The following rule blocks any UDP traffic with source port 200 and
destination port 50 going from host1 to the switch (corresponding to
rule 3 in the diagram above).

    [iptables] -A INPUT -i swp1 -p udp --sport 200 --dport 50 -j DROP

### Output Rule

The following rule blocks any TCP traffic with source port 123 and
destination port 123 going from Switch 1 to host2 (corresponding to rule
4 in the diagram above).

    [iptables] -A OUTPUT -o br-tag100 -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP

### Combined Rules

The following rule blocks any TCP traffic with source port 123 and
destination port 123 going from any switch port egress or generated from
Switch 1 to host1 or host2 (corresponding to rules 1 and 4 in the
diagram above).

    [iptables] -A OUTPUT,FORWARD -o swp+ -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP

This also becomes two ACLs and is the same as:

    [iptables]
    -A FORWARD -o swp+ -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP 
    -A OUTPUT -o swp+ -p tcp --sport 123 --dport 123 -j DROP

### Layer 2-only Rules/ebtables

The following rule blocks any traffic with source MAC address
00:00:00:00:00:12 and destination MAC address 08:9e:01:ce:e2:04 going
from any switch port egress/ingress.

    [ebtables] -A FORWARD -s 00:00:00:00:00:12 -d 08:9e:01:ce:e2:04 -j DROP

## Caveats and Errata

### Not All Rules Supported

Not all `iptables`, `ip6tables`, or `ebtables` rules are supported.
Refer to the [Supported Rules
section](#supported-rule-types) above for specific rule
support.

### ACL Log Policer Limits Traffic

To protect the CPU from overloading, traffic copied to the CPU is
limited to 1 pkt/s by an ACL Log Policer.

### Bridge Traffic Limitations

Bridge traffic that matches LOG ACTION rules are not logged in syslog;
the kernel and hardware identify packets using different information.

### Log Actions Cannot Be Forwarded

Logged packets cannot be forwarded. The hardware cannot both forward a
packet and send the packet to the control plane (or kernel) for logging.
To emphasize this, a log action must also have a drop action.

### Broadcom Range Checker Limitations

Broadcom platforms have only 24 range checkers. This is a separate
resource from the total number of ACLs allowed. If you are creating a
large ACL configuration, use port ranges for large ranges of more than 5
ports.

### Inbound LOG Actions Only for Broadcom Switches

On Broadcom-based switches, LOG actions can only be done on inbound
interfaces (the ingress direction), not on outbound interfaces (the
egress direction).

### SPAN Sessions that Reference an Outgoing Interface

SPAN sessions that reference an outgoing interface create mirrored
packets based on the ingress interface before the routing/switching
decision.

### Tomahawk Hardware Limitations

#### Rate Limiting per Pipeline, Not Global

On Tomahawk switches, the field processor (FP) polices on a per-pipeline
basis instead of globally, as with a Trident II switch. If packets come
in to different switch ports that are on different pipelines on the
ASIC, they might be rate limited differently.

For example, your switch is set so BFD is rate limited to 2000 packets
per second. When the BFD packets are received on port1/pipe1 and
port2/pipe2, they are each rate limited at 2000 pps; the switch is rate
limiting at 4000 pps overall. Because there are four pipelines on a
Tomahawk switch, you might see a fourfold increase of your configured
rate limits.

#### Atomic Update Mode Enabled by Default

In Cumulus Linux, atomic update mode is enabled by default. If you have
Tomahawk switches and plan to use SPAN and/or mangle rules, you must
disable atomic update mode.

To do so, enable nonatomic update mode by setting the value for
`acl.non_atomic_update_mode` to TRUE in `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf`,
then [restart `switchd`](../Configuring-switchd/#restart-switchd).

    acl.non_atomic_update_mode = TRUE

#### Packets Undercounted during ACL Updates

On Tomahawk switches, when updating egress FP rules, some packets do not
get counted. This results in an underreporting of counts during
ping-pong or incremental switchover.

### Trident II+ Hardware Limitations

On a Trident II+ switch, the TCAM allocation for ACLs is limited to 2048
rules in atomic mode for a default setup instead of 4096, as advertised
for ingress rules.

### Trident3 Hardware Limitations

#### TCAM Allocation

On a Trident3 switch, the TCAM allocation for ACLs is limited to 2048
rules in atomic mode for a default setup instead of 4096, as advertised
for ingress rules.

#### Enable Nonatomic Mode

On a Trident3 switch, you must enable nonatomic update mode before you
can configure ERSPAN. To do so, set the value for
`acl.non_atomic_update_mode` to TRUE in `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf`,
then [restart `switchd`](../Configuring-switchd/#restart-switchd).

    acl.non_atomic_update_mode = TRUE

#### Egress ACL Rules

On Trident3 switches, egress ACL rules matching on the output SVI
interface match layer 3 routed packets only, not bridged packets. To
match layer 2 traffic, use egress bridge member port-based rules.

### iptables Interactions with cl-acltool

Because Cumulus Linux is a Linux operating system, the `iptables`
commands can be used directly. However, consider using `cl-acltool`
instead because:

  - Without using `cl-acltool`, rules are not installed into hardware.
  - Running `cl-acltool -i` (the installation command) resets all rules
    and deletes anything that is not stored in
    `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf`.

    For example, running the following command works:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP

    And the rules appear when you run `cl-acltool -L`:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo cl-acltool -L ip
        -------------------------------
        Listing rules of type iptables:
        -------------------------------
        TABLE filter :
        Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 72 packets, 5236 bytes)
         pkts bytes target  prot opt in   out   source    destination
         
            0     0 DROP    icmp --  any  any   anywhere  anywhere      icmp echo-request

    However, running `cl-acltool -i` or `reboot` removes them. To ensure
    all rules that can be in hardware are hardware accelerated, place
    them in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.conf` file, then run
    `cl-acltool -i`.

### Mellanox Spectrum Hardware Limitations

Due to hardware limitations in the Spectrum ASIC, [BFD policers](../../Layer-3/Bidirectional-Forwarding-Detection-BFD)
are shared between all BFD-related control plane rules. Specifically the
following default rules share the same policer in the
`00control_plan.rules` file:

    [iptables]
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_ECHO_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000
    -A $INGRESS_CHAIN -p udp --dport $BFD_MH_PORT -j POLICE --set-mode pkt --set-rate 2000 --set-burst 2000

To work around this limitation, set the rate and burst of all 6 of these
rules to the same values, using the `--set-rate` and `--set-burst`
options.

### Where to Assign Rules

  - If a switch port is assigned to a bond, any egress rules must be
    assigned to the bond.
  - When using the OUTPUT chain, rules must be assigned to the source.
    For example, if a rule is assigned to the switch port in the
    direction of traffic but the source is a bridge (VLAN), the traffic
    is not affected by the rule and must be applied to the bridge.
  - If all transit traffic needs to have a rule applied, use the FORWARD
    chain, not the OUTPUT chain.

### Generic Error Message Displayed after ACL Rule Installation Failure

After an ACL rule installation failure, a generic error message like the
following is displayed:

    cumulus@switch:$ sudo cl-acltool -i -p 00control_plane.rules
    Using user provided rule file 00control_plane.rules
    Reading rule file 00control_plane.rules ...
    Processing rules in file 00control_plane.rules ...
    error: hw sync failed (sync_acl hardware installation failed)
    Installing acl policy... Rolling back ..
    failed.

### Dell S3048-ON Supports only 24K MAC Addresses

The Dell S3048-ON has a limit of 24576 MAC address entries instead of
32K for other 1G switches.

### Mellanox Spectrum ASICs and INPUT Chain Rules

On switches with Mellanox Spectrum ASICs, INPUT chain rules are implemented using a
trap mechanism. Packets headed to the CPU are assigned trap IDs. The
default INPUT chain rules are mapped to these trap IDs. However, if a
packet matches multiple traps, they are resolved by an internal priority
mechanism that might be different from the rule priorities. Packets
might not get policed by the default expected rule, but by another rule
instead. For example, ICMP packets headed to the CPU are policed by the
LOCAL rule instead of the ICMP rule. Also, multiple rules might share
the same trap. In this case the policer that is applied is the largest
of the policer values.

To work around this issue, create rules on the INPUT and FORWARD chains
(INPUT,FORWARD).

### Hardware Policing of Packets in the Input Chain

On certain platforms, there are limitations on hardware policing of
packets in the INPUT chain. To work around these limitations, Cumulus
Linux supports kernel based policing of these packets in software using
limit/hashlimit matches. Rules with these matches are not hardware
offloaded, but are ignored during hardware install.

### ACLs Do not Match when the Output Port on the ACL is a Subinterface

Packets don't get matched when a subinterface is configured as the output port.
The ACL matches on packets only if the primary port is configured as an output
port. If a subinterface is set as an output or egress port, the packets match correctly.

For example:

    -A FORWARD --out-interface swp49s1.100 -j ACCEPT

### Mellanox Switches and Egress ACL Matching on Bonds

On the Mellanox switch, ACL rules that match on an outbound *bond* interface are not supported. For example, the following rule is not supported:

```
[iptables]
-A FORWARD --out-interface <bond_intf> -j DROP
```

To work around this issue, duplicate the ACL rule on each physical port of the bond. For example:

```
[iptables]
-A FORWARD --out-interface <bond-member-port-1> -j DROP
-A FORWARD --out-interface <bond-member-port-2> -j DROP
```
