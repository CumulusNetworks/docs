## What is Cumulus Linux?

Cumulus Linux is the first full-featured Linux operating system for the networking industry. The [Debian Buster](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/)-based, networking-focused distribution runs on hardware produced by a [broad partner ecosystem](https://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/), ensuring unmatched customer choice regarding silicon, optics, cables, and systems.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the Cumulus Linux installation process, system configuration and management, network solutions, and monitoring and troubleshooting recommendations. In addition, the quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process to get you started.

Cumulus Linux 4.0 includes the latest NetQ agent and CLI, which is installed by default on the Cumulus Linux switch. Use NetQ to monitor and manage your data center network infrastructure and operational health. Refer to the [NetQ documentation] (../../cumulus-netq/) for details.

For information on new features, bug fixes, and known issues present in this release, refer to the [release notes](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038927193-Cumulus-Linux-4-0-Release-Notes/).

### Open Source Contributions

To implement various Cumulus Linux features, Cumulus Networks has forked various software projects, like CFEngine `Netdev` and some Puppet Labs packages. Some of the forked code resides in the Cumulus Networks [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks) and some is available as part of the Cumulus Linux repository as Debian source packages.

### Hardware Compatibility List

You can find the most up-to-date hardware compatibility list (HCL) [here](https://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/). Use the HCL to confirm that your switch model is supported by Cumulus Networks. The HCL is updated regularly, listing products by port configuration, manufacturer, and SKU part number.
