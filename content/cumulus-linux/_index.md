## <span>What is Cumulus Linux?</span>

Cumulus Linux is the first full-featured Linux operating system for the
networking industry. The [Debian
Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/)-based,
networking-focused distribution runs on hardware produced by a [broad
partner ecosystem](http://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/), ensuring unmatched
customer choice regarding silicon, optics, cables, and systems.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the Cumulus Linux
installation process, system configuration and management, network
solutions, and monitoring and troubleshooting recommendations. In
addition, the quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process to
get you started.

This documentation is current as of May 7, 2019 for version 3.7.6. Visit
