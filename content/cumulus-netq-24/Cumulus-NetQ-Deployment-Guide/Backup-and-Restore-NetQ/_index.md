It is recommended that you back up your NetQ data according to your company policy. Typically this includes after key configuration changes and on a scheduled basis.

These topics describe how to backup and also restore your NetQ data for on-premises NetQ Platforms (running on your hardware) or for the on-premises NetQ Appliance.

{{%notice note%}}
These procedures *do not* apply to your NetQ Cloud  server or the NetQ Cloud Appliance. Data backup is handled automatically with the NetQ Cloud service.
