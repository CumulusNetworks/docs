This topic describes how to upgrade from your current NetQ 2.4.0 installation to the NetQ 2.4.1 release to take advantage of new capabilities and bug fixes (refer to the {{<link title="Cumulus NetQ 2.4 Release Notes" text="release notes">}}).

You must upgrade your NetQ Platform(s) or NetQ/NetQ Cloud Appliance(s) and the NetQ Agents on your monitored switches and hosts. If you want access to new and updated commands, you can upgrade the CLI on the NetQ Platform(s), NetQ/NetQ Cloud Appliance(s), and monitored switches and hosts as well.

To complete the upgrade for either an on-premises or a cloud deployment:

- Start with {{<link title="Upgrade the NetQ Platform">}}
- Then go to {{<link title="Upgrade NetQ Agents">}}
- Optionally, go to {{<link title="Upgrade NetQ CLI">}}

{{%notice note%}}
If you are currently running NetQ 2.4.0 and you installed the NetQ 2.4.0 Agent, you may need to update the agent. Refer to {{<link title="Update NetQ 2.4.0 Agents">}}.
