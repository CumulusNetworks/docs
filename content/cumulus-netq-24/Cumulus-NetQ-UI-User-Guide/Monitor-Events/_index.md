Two event workflows, the Alarms card workflow and the Info card
workflow, provide a view into the events occurring in the network. The
Alarms card workflow tracks critical severity events, whereas the Info
card workflow tracks all warning, info, and debug severity events.

To focus on events from a single device perspective, refer to
