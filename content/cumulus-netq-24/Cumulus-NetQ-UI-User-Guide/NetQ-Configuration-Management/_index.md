As an administrator, you have two major tasks related to managing Cumulus NetQ:

- {{<link title="Application Management">}}: manage access to and various application-wide settings for the Cumulus NetQ UI from a single location
- {{<link title="Lifecycle Management">}}: manage the software deployment onto your network devices

The NetQ UI makes both of these tasks easier than ever.
