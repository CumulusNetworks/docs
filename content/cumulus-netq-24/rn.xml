<td>NetQ UI: This only applies to the NetQ 2.3.1 UI installed on the NetQ Server or NetQ Appliance in on-premises deployments. Cloud deployments are not impacted by this bug. Trace results are not shown after running an on-demand or scheduled trace request in the NetQ UI. The medium Trace Result cards are blank whether the trace was successful or not. The full-screen Trace Result card and the NetQ CLI show the results correctly.
To work around this issue, apply the update to your existing 2.3.1 build as follows:

* Download the update tarball.
If your server or appliance has internet access, use {{wget}} to perform the download. Be sure to use your download directory in place of _/home/cumulus_ indicated in this example.
&lt;pre&gt;
cumulus@opta:~$ wget http://netq-shared.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NetQ-2.3.1.1.tgz -O /home/cumulus/NetQ-2.3.1.1.tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;
If your server or appliance is air-gapped, first download the tarball and then, as a root user, copy it to the appropriate directory on your server or appliance.
&lt;pre&gt;
root@opta:~# cd /mnt/swinstalls/
root@opta:/mnt/swinstalls# cp /home/cumulus/NetQ-2.3.1.1.tgz ./ 
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Extract the script.
&lt;pre&gt;
cumulus@opta:~$ tar -xvzf /home/cumulus/NetQ-2.3.1.1.tgz update-app.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Run the script. On completion, a new GUI container will be running and the card will display the trace result.
&lt;pre&gt;

<td>When you upgrade both the NetQ Agent and the NetQ Apps in on-premises deployments, a temporary increase in event messages is seen. They are the result of collecting package information from the NetQ Agent on each monitored node. This only happens on initial upgrade and there is no functional impact to the operation of the NetQ software.</td>
