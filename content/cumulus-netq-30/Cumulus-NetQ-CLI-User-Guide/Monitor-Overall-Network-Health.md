NetQ provides the information you need to monitor the health of your network fabric, devices, and interfaces. You are able to easily validate the operation and view the configuration across the entire network from switches to hosts to containers. For example, you can monitor the operation of routing protocols and virtual network configurations, the status of NetQ Agents and hardware components, and the operation and efficiency of interfaces. When issues are present, NetQ makes it easy to identify and resolve them. You can also see when changes have occurred to the network, devices, and interfaces by viewing their operation, configuration, and status at an earlier point in time.

## Validate Network Health

NetQ `check` commands validate the various elements of your network fabric, looking for inconsistencies in configuration across your fabric, connectivity faults, missing configuration, and so forth, and then and display the results for your assessment. They can be run from any node in the network.

### Validate the Network Fabric

You can validate the following network fabric elements:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check
    agents      :  Netq agent
    bgp         :  BGP info
    cl-version  :  Cumulus Linux version
    clag        :  Cumulus Multi-chassis LAG
    evpn        :  EVPN
    interfaces  :  network interface port
    license     :  License information
    mlag        :  Multi-chassis LAG (alias of clag)
    mtu         :  Link MTU
    ntp         :  NTP
    ospf        :  OSPF info
    sensors     :  Temperature/Fan/PSU sensors
    vlan        :  VLAN
    vxlan       :  VXLAN data path
```

## Validation Commands

The validation commands have been changed in this release:

- You can view more detail about the validation tests that are run with each command
- You can filter these tests to run only those tests of interest

{{%notice info%}}
If you are running scripts based on the older version of the `netq check` commands and want to stay with the old output, edit the *netq.yml* file to include `old-check: true` in the `netq-cli` section of the file. For example:

```
netq-cli:
  port: 32708
  server: 127.0.0.1
  old-check: true
```
  
Then run `netq config restart cli` to apply the change.

If you update your scripts to work with the new version of the commands, simply change the `old-check` value to *false* or remove it. Then restart the CLI.
{{%/notice%}}

The new syntax of the `netq check` commands is:

```
netq check agents [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <agent-number-range-list> | exclude <agent-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json]
netq check bgp [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [vrf <vrf>] [include <bgp-number-range-list> | exclude <bgp-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check mlag [hostnames <text-list-hostnames> ] [include <mlag-number-range-list> | exclude <mlag-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check evpn [mac-consistency] [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <evpn-number-range-list> | exclude <evpn-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check interfaces [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <interface-number-range-list> | exclude <interface-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check license [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <license-number-range-list> | exclude <license-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check mtu [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [unverified] [include <mtu-number-range-list> | exclude <mtu-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check ntp [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <ntp-number-range-list> | exclude <ntp-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check ospf [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <ospf-number-range-list> | exclude <ospf-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check sensors [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <sensors-number-range-list> | exclude <sensors-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check vlan [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [unverified] [include <vlan-number-range-list> | exclude <vlan-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
netq check vxlan [hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <vxlan-number-range-list> | exclude <vxlan-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]
```

Each of the check commands provides a starting point for troubleshooting configuration and connectivity issues within your network in real time.

{{%notice tip%}}
Use `netq check mlag` in place of `netq check clag` from NetQ 2.4 onward. `netq check clag` remains available for automation scripts, but you should begin migrating to `netq check mlag` to maintain compatibility with future NetQ releases.
{{%/notice%}}

You can view only the summary of the validation results by running the `netq check` commands with `summary` option; for example, `netq check agents summary` or `netq check evpn summary`. This summary displays such data as the total number of nodes checked, how many failed a test, total number of sessions checked, how many of these that failed, and so forth.

You can view more information about the individual tests that are run as part of the validation, including individual tests for agents.

You can run validations for a time in the past and output the results in JSON format if desired. The `around` option enables users to view the network state at an earlier time. The `around` option value requires an integer *plus* a unit of measure (UOM), with no space between them. The following are valid UOMs:

| UOM | Command Value | Example|
| --- | ------------- | -------|
| day(s) | <#>d | 3d |
| hour(s) | <#>h | 6h |
| minute(s) | <#>m | 30m |
| second(s) | <#>s | 20s |

{{%notice tip%}}
If you want to go back in time by months or years, use the equivalent number of days.
{{%/notice%}}

You can include or exclude one or more of the various tests performed during the validation. Each test is assigned a number, which is used to identify which tests to run. By default, all tests are run. The value of `<protocol-number-range-list>` is a number list separated by commas, or a range using a dash, or a combination of these. Do not use spaces after commas. For example:

- include 1,3,5
- include 1-5
- include 1,3-5
- exclude 6,7
- exclude 6-7
- exclude 3,4-7,9

The output indicates whether a given test passed, failed, or was skipped.

{{%notice tip%}}
Output from the `netq check` commands are color-coded; green for successful results and red for failures, warnings, and errors. Use the `netq config add color` command to enable the use of color.

### What the NetQ Validation System Checks

Each of the `netq check` commands perform a set of validation tests appropriate to the protocol or element being validated.

To view the list of tests run for a given protocol or service, use either `netq show unit-tests <protocol/service>` or perform a tab completion on `netq check <protocol/service> [include|exclude]`.

This section describes these tests.

### NetQ Agent Validation Tests

The `netq check agents` command looks for an agent status of Rotten for each node in the network. A *Fresh* status indicates the Agent is running as expected. The Agent sends a heartbeat every 30 seconds, and if three consecutive heartbeats are missed, its status changes to *Rotten*. This check only runs one test:

## Validation Examples

This section provides validation examples for a variety of protocols and elements.

### Perform a NetQ Agent Validation

The default validation confirms that the NetQ Agent is running on all monitored nodes and provides a summary of the validation results. This example shows the results of a fully successful validation.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check agents
agent check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 13
Total nodes         : 13
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Agent Health Test   : passed
```

### Perform a BGP Validation

The default validation runs a network-wide BGP connectivity and configuration check on all nodes running the BGP service:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp
bgp check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 8
Total nodes         : 8
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Total Sessions      : 30
Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed
Address Families Test        : passed
Router ID Test               : passed

```

This example indicates that all nodes running BGP and all BGP sessions are running properly. If there were issues with any of the nodes, NetQ would provide information about each node to aid in resolving the issues.

### Perform a BGP Validation for a Particular VRF

Using the `vrf <vrf>` option of the `netq check bgp` command, you can validate the BGP service where communication is occurring through a particular virtual route. In this example, the VRF of interest is named *vrf1*.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp vrf vrf1
bgp check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 2
Total nodes         : 2
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Total Sessions      : 2
Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed
Address Families Test        : passed
Router ID Test               : passed
```

### Perform a BGP Validation with Selected Tests

Using the `include <bgp-number-range-list>` and `exclude <bgp-number-range-list>` options, you can include or exclude one or more of the various checks performed during the validation. You can select from the following BGP validation tests:

| Test Number | Test Name |
| :---------: | --------- |
| 0 | Session Establishment |
| 1 | Address Families |
| 2 | Router ID |

Refer to {{<link url="#bgp-validation-tests" text="BGP Validation Tests">}} for a description of these tests.

To include only the session establishment and router ID tests during a validation, run either of these commands:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp include 0,2

cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp exclude 1
```

Either way, a successful validation output would be similar to the following:

```
bgp check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 8
Total nodes         : 8
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Total Sessions      : 30
Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed,
Address Families Test        : skipped
Router ID Test               : passed,
```

### Perform a BGP Validation and Output Results to JSON File

This example shows the default BGP validation results as it appears in a JSON file.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp json

    "validation":"bgp"
}
```

### Perform a CLAG Validation

The default validation runs a network-wide CLAG connectivity and configuration check on all nodes running the CLAG service. This example shows results for a fully successful validation.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check clag
clag check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 4
Total nodes         : 4
Rotten nodes        : 0

Speed Test         : passed,
Autoneg Test       : passed,
```

### Perform an Interfaces Validation for a Time in the Past

Using the `around` option, you can view the state of the interfaces at a time in the past. Be sure to include the UOM.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check interfaces around 6h
interface check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 12
Total nodes         : 12
Rotten nodes        : 0

Admin State Test   : passed,
Oper State Test    : passed,
Speed Test         : passed,
Autoneg Test       : passed,
```

### Perform an Interfaces Validation with Selected Tests

Using the `include <interface-number-range-list>` and `exclude <interface-number-range-list>` options, you can include or exclude one or more of the various checks performed during the validation. You can select from the following interface validation tests:

| Test Number | Test Name |
| :---------: | --------- |
| 0 | Admin State |
| 1 | Oper State |
| 2 | Speed |
| 3 | Autoneg |

Refer to {{<link url="#interface-validation-tests" text="Interface Validation Tests">}} for descriptions of these tests.

### Perform a License Validation

You can also check for any nodes that have invalid licenses without going to each node. Because switches do not operate correctly without a valid license you might want to verify that your Cumulus Linux licenses on a regular basis.

This example shows that all licenses on switches are valid.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check license
license check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 12
Total nodes         : 12
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Checked Licenses    : 8
Failed Licenses     : 0

License validity Test   : passed,
```

{{%notice tip%}}
This command checks every node, meaning every switch and host in the network. Hosts do not require a Cumulus Linux license, so the number of licenses checked might be smaller than the total number of nodes checked.
{{%/notice%}}

### Perform a Link MTU Validation  

The default validate verifies that all corresponding interface links have matching MTUs. This example shows no mismatches.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check mtu
mtu check result summary:

Total nodes         : 12
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Warn Links          : 0
Failed Links        : 0
Checked Links       : 196

Link MTU Consistency Test   : passed,
VLAN interface Test         : passed,
Bridge interface Test       : passed,
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check mlag
mlag check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 4
Total nodes         : 4
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0

```

### Perform a Sensors Validation

Hardware platforms have a number sensors to provide environmental data about the switches. Knowing these are all within range is a good check point for maintenance.

For example, if you had a temporary HVAC failure and you are concerned that some of your nodes are beginning to overheat, you can run this validation to determine if any switches have already reached the maximum temperature threshold.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check sensors
sensors check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 8
Total nodes         : 8
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Checked Sensors     : 136
Failed Sensors      : 0

PSU sensors Test           : passed,
Fan sensors Test           : passed,
Temperature sensors Test   : passed,
```

### Perform a VLAN Validation

Validate that VLANS are configured and operating properly:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check vlan
vlan check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 12
Total nodes         : 12
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Failed Link Count   : 0
Total Link Count    : 196

Link Neighbor VLAN Consistency Test   : passed,
Clag Bond VLAN Consistency Test       : passed,
```

### Perform a VXLAN Validation

Validate that VXLANs are configured and operating properly:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check vxlan
vxlan check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 6
Total nodes         : 6
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Vlan Consistency Test   : passed,
BUM replication Test    : passed,
```

{{%notice tip%}}
Both asymmetric and symmetric VXLAN configurations are validated with this command.
{{%/notice%}}

## Validation Check Result Filtering

You can create filters to suppress false alarms or uninteresting errors and warnings that can be a nuisance in CI workflows. For example, certain configurations permit a singly-connected CLAG bond and the standard error that is generated is not useful.

{{%notice note%}}
Filtered errors and warnings related to validation checks do NOT generate notifications and are not counted in the alarm and info event totals. They are counted as part of suppressed notifications instead.
{{%/notice%}}

The filters are defined in the  `check-filter.yml` file in the `/etc/netq/` directory. You can create a rule for individual check commands or you can create a global rule that applies to all tests run by the check command. Additionally, you can create a rule specific to a particular test run by the check command.

Each rule must contain at least one `match` criteria and an `action` response. The only action currently available is *filter*. The match can be comprised of multiple criteria, one per line, creating a logical AND. Matches can be made against any column in the validation check output. The match criteria values *must match* the case and spacing of the column names in the corresponding `netq check` output and are parsed as regular expressions.

This example shows a global rule for the BGP checks that indicates any events generated by the *DataVrf* virtual route forwarding interface coming from *swp3* or *swp7.* are to be suppressed. It also shows a test-specific rule to filter all Address Families events from devices with hostnames starting with *exit-1* or *firewall*.

```
bgp:
    global:
        - rule:
            match:
                VRF: DataVrf
                Peer Name: (swp3|swp7.)
            action:
                filter
    tests:
        Address Families:
            - rule:
                match:
                    Hostname: (^exit1|firewall)
                action:
                    filter
```

### Create Filters for Provisioning Exceptions

You can configure filters to change validation errors to warnings that would normally occur due to the default expectations of the `netq check` commands. This applies to all protocols and services, except for Agents. For example, if you have provisioned BGP with configurations where a BGP peer is not expected or desired, you will get errors that a BGP peer is missing. By creating a filter, you can remove the error in favor of a warning.

To create a validation filter:

1. Navigate to the */etc/netq* directory.

2. Create or open the *check_filter.yml*  file using your text editor of choice.

    This file contains the syntax to follow to create one or more rules for one or more protocols or services. Create your own rules, and/or edit and un-comment any example rules you would like to use.

    ```
    # Netq check result filter rule definition file.  This is for filtering
    # results based on regex match on one or more columns of each test result.

```

For example, to validate the the status of the NetQ agents running in the fabric, run `netq show agents`. A *Fresh* status indicates the Agent is running as expected. The Agent sends a heartbeat every 30 seconds, and if three consecutive heartbeats are missed, its status changes to
*Rotten*.
