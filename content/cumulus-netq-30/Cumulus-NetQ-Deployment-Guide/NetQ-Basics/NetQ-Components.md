Cumulus NetQ contains the following applications and key components:

  - Telemetry data collection and aggregation
      - NetQ switch agents
      - NetQ host agents
      - Telemetry data aggregation
      - Database
  - Data streaming
  - Network services
  - User interfaces

While these function apply to both the on-site and in-cloud solutions, where
the functions reside varies, as shown here.

NetQ interfaces with event notification applications, third-party
analytics tools.

Each of the NetQ components used to gather, store and process data about
the network state are described here.

## NetQ Agents

NetQ Agents are software installed and running on every monitored *node*
in the network - including Cumulus® Linux® switches, Linux bare-metal
hosts, and virtual machines. The NetQ Agents push network data regularly
and event information immediately to the NetQ Platform.

### Switch Agents

The NetQ Agents running on Cumulus Linux switches gather the following
network data via {{<exlink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3549" text="Netlink">}}:

  - Interfaces
  - IP addresses (v4 and v6)
  - IP routes (v4 and v6)
  - Links
  - Bridge FDB (MAC Address table)
  - ARP Entries/Neighbors (IPv4 and IPv6)

for the following protocols:

  - Bridging protocols: LLDP, STP, MLAG
  - Routing protocols: BGP, OSPF
  - Network virtualization: EVPN, VXLAN

The NetQ Agent is supported on Cumulus Linux 3.3.2 and later.

### Host Agents

The NetQ Agents running on hosts gather the same information as that for
switches, plus the following network data:

  - Network IP and MAC addresses
  - Container IP and MAC addresses

The NetQ Agent obtains container
information by listening to the Kubernetes orchestration tool.

The NetQ Agent is supported on hosts running Ubuntu 16.04, Red Hat®
Enterprise Linux 7, and CentOS 7 Operating Systems.

## NetQ Core

The NetQ core performs the data collection, storage, and processing
for delivery to various user interfaces. It is comprised of a collection
of scalable components running entirely within a single server. The NetQ
software queries this server, rather than individual devices enabling
greater scalability of the system. Each of these components is described
briefly here.

### Data Aggregation

The data aggregation component collects data coming from all of the NetQ
Agents. It then filters, compresses, and forwards the data to the
streaming component. The server monitors for missing messages and also
monitors the NetQ Agents themselves, providing alarms when appropriate.
In addition to the telemetry data collected from the NetQ Agents, the
aggregation component collects information from the switches and hosts,
such as vendor, model, version, and basic operational state.

### Data Stores

Two types of data stores are used in the NetQ product. The first stores
the raw data, data aggregations, and discrete events needed for quick
response to data requests. The second stores data based on correlations,
transformations and processing of the raw data.

### Real-time Streaming

The streaming component processes the incoming raw data from the
aggregation server in real time. It reads the metrics and stores them as
a time series, and triggers alarms based on anomaly detection,
thresholds, and events.

### Network Services

The network services component monitors protocols and services operation
individually and on a network-wide basis and stores status details.

### User Interfaces

NetQ data is available through several
user interfaces:

  - NetQ CLI (command line interface)
  - NetQ UI (graphical user interface)
  - NetQ RESTful API (representational state transfer application programming interface)

The CLI and UI query the RESTful API for
the data to present. Standard integrations can be configured to
integrate with third-party notification tools.
