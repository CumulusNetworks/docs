CumulusÂ® NetQ is a highly-scalable, modern network operations tool set
that provides visibility and troubleshooting of your overlay and
underlay networks in real-time. NetQ delivers actionable insights and
operational intelligence about the health of your data center - from the
container, virtual machine, or host, all the way to the switch and port.
NetQ correlates configuration and operational status, and instantly
identifies and tracks state changes while simplifying management for the
entire Linux-based data center. With NetQ, network operations change
from a manual, reactive, box-by-box approach to an automated, informed
and agile one.

Cumulus NetQ performs three primary
functions:

  - **Data collection**: real-time and historical telemetry and network
    state information
  - **Data analytics**: deep processing of the data
  - **Data visualization**: rich graphical user interface (GUI) for
    actionable insight

NetQ is available as an on-site or in-cloud deployment.

Unlike other network operations tools, NetQ delivers significant
operational improvements to your network
management and maintenance processes. It simplifies the data center
network by reducing the complexity through real-time visibility into
hardware and software status and eliminating the guesswork associated
with investigating issues through the analysis and presentation of
detailed, focused data.

## Demystify Overlay Networks

While overlay networks provide significant advantages in network
management, it can be difficult to troubleshoot issues that occur in the
overlay one box at a time. You are unable to correlate what events
(configuration changes, power outages, etc.) may have caused problems in
the network and when they occurred. Only a sampling of data is available
to use for your analysis. By contrast, with Cumulus NetQ deployed, you
have a network-wide view of the overlay network, can correlate events
with what is happening now or in the past, and have real-time data to
fill out the complete picture of your network health and operation.

In summary:

| Without NetQ                               | With NetQ                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Difficult to debug overlay network         | View network-wide status of overlay network                         |
| Hard to find out what happened in the past | View historical activity with time-machine view                     |
| Periodically sampled data                  | Real-time collection of telemetry data for a more complete data set |

## Protect Network Integrity with NetQ Validation

Network configuration changes can cause numerous trouble tickets because
you are not able to test a new configuration before deploying it. When
the tickets start pouring in, you are stuck with a large amount of data
that is collected and stored in multiple tools making correlation of the
events to the resolution required difficult at best. Isolating faults in
the past is challenging. By contract, with Cumulus NetQ deployed, you
can proactively verify a configuration change as inconsistencies and
misconfigurations can be caught prior to deployment. And historical data
is readily available to correlate past events with current issues.

## Troubleshoot Issues Across the Network

Troubleshooting networks is challenging in the best of times, but trying
to do so manually, one box at a time, and digging through a series of
long and ugly logs make the job harder than it needs to be. Cumulus NetQ
provides rolled up and correlated network status on a regular basis,
enabling you to get down to the root of the problem quickly, whether it
occurred recently or over a week ago. The graphical user interface makes
this possible visually to speed the analysis.

## Track Connectivity with NetQ Trace

Conventional trace only traverses the data path looking for problems,
and does so on a node to node basis. For paths with a small number of
hops that might be fine, but in larger networks, it can become extremely
time consuming. With Cumulus NetQ both the data and control paths are
verified providing additional information. It discovers
misconfigurations along all of the hops in one go, speeding the time to
resolution.

In summary:

| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
