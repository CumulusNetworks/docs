As with any network, one of the challenges is keeping track of all of the moving parts. With the NetQ GUI, you can view the overall health of your network at a glance and then delve deeper for periodic checks or as conditions arise that require attention. For a general understanding of how well your network is operating, the Network Health card workflow is the best place to start as it contains the highest view and performance roll-ups.

## Network Health Card Workflow Summary

The small Network Health card displays:

## View Network Health Summary

Overall network health is based on successful validation results. The summary includes the percentage of successful results, a trend indicator, and a distribution of the validation results.

To view a summary of your network health, open the small Network Health card.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-hlth-small-230.png" width="200">}}

In this example, the overall health is relatively good, but improving compared to recent status. Refer to the next section for viewing the key health metrics.

## View Key Metrics of Network Health

Overall network health is a calculated average of several key health metrics: System, Network Services, and Interface health.

To view these key metrics, open the medium Network Health card. Each metric is shown with the the percentage of successful validations, a trend indicator, and a distribution of the validation results.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-hlth-medium-230.png" width="200">}}

In this example, the health of each of the system and network services are good, but interface health is on the lower side. While it is improving, you might choose to dig further if it does not continue to improve. Refer to the following section for additional details.

## View System Health

The system health is a calculated average of the NetQ Agent, Cumulus Linux license, and sensor health metrics. In all cases, validation is performed on the agents and licenses. If you are monitoring platform sensors, the calculation includes these as well. You can view the overall health of the system from the medium Network Health card and information about each component from the System Health tab on the large Network Health card.

To view information about each system component:

1.  Open the large Network Health card.
2.  Hover over the card and click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/04-Programing-Apps-Websites/12-Apps/app-window-heart.svg" height="18" width="18"/>.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-hlth-large-sys-hlth-tab-241.png" width="500">}}

    The health of each system protocol or service is represented on the left side of the card by a distribution of the health score, a trend indicator, and a percentage of successful results. The right side of the card provides a listing of devices running the services.

### View Devices with the Most Issues

It is useful to know which devices are experiencing the most issues with their system services in general, as this can help focus troubleshooting efforts toward selected devices versus the service itself. To view devices with the most issues, select **Most Failures** from the filter above the table on the right.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-health-large-table-options-222.png" width="300">}}

Devices with the highest number of issues are listed at the top. Scroll down to view those with fewer issues. To further investigate the critical devices, open the Event cards and filter on the indicated switches.

### View Devices with Recent Issues

It is useful to know which devices are experiencing the most issues with their system services right now, as this can help focus troubleshooting efforts toward selected devices versus the service itself. To view devices with recent issues, select **Recent Failures** from the filter
above the table on the right. Devices with the highest number of issues are listed at the top. Scroll down to view those with fewer issues. To further investigate the critical devices, open the Switch card or the Event cards and filter on the indicated switches.

### Filter Results by System Service

You can focus the data in the table on the right, by unselecting one or more services. Click the *checkbox* next to the service you want to remove from the data. In this example, we have unchecked Licenses.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-hlth-large-filter-sys-hlth-in-tbl-241.png" width="500">}}

This removes the checkbox next to the associated chart and grays out the title of the chart, temporarily removing the data related to that service from the table. Add it back by hovering over the chart and clicking the checkbox that appears.

### View Details of a Particular System Service

From the System Health tab on the large Network Health card you can click on a chart to take you to the full-screen card pre-focused on that service data.

## View Network Services Health

The network services health is a calculated average of the individual network protocol and services health metrics. In all cases, validation is performed on NTP. If you are running BGP, CLAG, EVPN, OSPF, or VXLAN protocols the calculation includes these as well. You can view the overall health of network services from the medium Network Health card and information about individual services from the Network Service Health tab on the large Network Health card.

To view information about each network protocol or service:

1.  Open the large Network Health card.
2.  Hover over the card and click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/05-Internet-Networks-Servers/01-Worldwide-Web/network-heart.svg" height="18" width="18"/>.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-hlth-large-ntwk-hlth-tab-241.png" width="500">}}

The health of each network protocol or service is represented on the left side of the card by a distribution of the health score, a trend indicator, and a percentage of successful results. The right side of the card provides a listing of devices running the services.

{{%notice tip%}}
If you have more services running than fit naturally into the chart area, a scroll bar appears for you to access their data. Use the scroll bars on the table to view more columns and rows.
{{%/notice%}}

### View Details of a Particular Interface Service

From the Interface Health tab on the large Network Health card you can click on a chart to take you to the full-screen card pre-focused on that service data.

## View All Network Protocol and Service Validation Results

The Network Health card workflow enables you to view all of the results
of all validations run on the network protocols and services during the
designated time period.

To view all the validation results:

1. Open the full screen Network Health card.
2. Click *\<network protocol or service name\>* tab in the navigation panel.
3. Look for patterns in the data. For example, when did nodes, sessions, links, ports, or devices start failing validation? Was it at a specific time? Was it when you starting running the service on more nodes? Did sessions fail, but nodes were fine?

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-hlth-fullscr-bgp-tab-241.png" width="700" >}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options include:

- Look for matching event information for the failure points in a given protocol or service.
- When you find failures in one protocol, compare with higher level protocols to see if they fail at a similar time (or vice versa with supporting services).
- Export the data for use in another analytics tool, by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/05-Internet-Networks-Servers/08-Upload-Download/download-bottom.svg" height="18" width="18"/> and providing a name for the data file.
