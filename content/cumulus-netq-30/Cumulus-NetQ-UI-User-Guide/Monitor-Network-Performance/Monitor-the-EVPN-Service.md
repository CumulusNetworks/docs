The Cumulus NetQ UI enables operators to view the health of the EVPN service on a network-wide and a per session basis, giving greater insight into all aspects of the service. This is accomplished through two card workflows, one for the service and one for the session. They are described separately here.

## Monitor the EVPN Service (All Sessions)

With NetQ, you can monitor the number of nodes running the EVPN service, view switches with the sessions, total number of VNIs, and alarms triggered by the EVPN service. For an overview and how to configure EVPN in your data center network, refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Network-Virtualization/Ethernet-Virtual-Private-Network-EVPN/" text="Ethernet Virtual Private Network-EVPN">}}.

### View Service Status Summary

A summary of the EVPN service is available from the Network Services card workflow, including the number of nodes running the service, the number of EVPN-related alarms, and a distribution of those alarms.

To view the summary, open the small EVPN Network Service card.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-evpn-small-230.png" width="200" >}}

For more detail, select a different size EVPN Network Service card.

### View the Distribution of Sessions and Alarms

It is useful to know the number of network nodes running the EVPN protocol over a period of time, as it gives you insight into the amount of traffic associated with and breadth of use of the protocol. It is also useful to compare the number of nodes running EVPN with the alarms present at the same time to determine if there is any correlation between the issues and the ability to establish an EVPN session.

To view these distributions, open the medium EVPN Service card.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-evpn-medium-230.png" width="200">}}

If a visual correlation is apparent, you can dig a little deeper with the large EVPN Service card tabs.

### View the Distribution of Layer 3 VNIs

It is useful to know the number of layer 3 VNIs, as it gives you insight into the complexity of the VXLAN.

To view this distribution, open the large EVPN Service card and view the bottom chart on the left.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-evpn-large-summary-tab-vni-chart-300.png" width="500">}}

### View Devices with the Most EVPN Sessions

You can view the load from EVPN on your switches and hosts using the large EVPN Service card. This data enables you to see which switches are handling the most EVPN traffic currently, validate that is what is expected based on your network design, and compare that with data from an earlier time to look for any differences.

To view switches and hosts with the most EVPN sessions:

1. Open the large EVPN Service card.

2. Select **Top Switches with Most Sessions** from the filter above the table.

    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes running the most EVPN sessions at the top. Scroll down to view those with the fewest sessions.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-evpn-large-summary-tab-top-sessions-300.png" width="500">}}

To compare this data with the same data at a previous time:

1. Open another large EVPN Service card.

2. Move the new card next to the original card if needed.

3. Change the time period for the data on the new card by hovering over the card and clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/18-Time/time-stopwatch.svg" height="18" width="18"/>.

4.  Select the time period that you want to compare with the current time.  

    You can now see whether there are significant differences between this time period and the previous time period.  

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/time-picker-popup-narrow-222.png" width="150">}}

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-evpn-large-summary-tab-past-week-230.png" width="500" >}}

If the changes are unexpected, you can investigate further by looking at another time frame, determining if more nodes are now running EVPN than previously, looking for changes in the topology, and so forth.

### View Devices with the Most Layer 2 EVPN Sessions

You can view the number layer 2 EVPN sessions on your switches and hosts using the large EVPN Service card. This data enables you to see which switches are handling the most EVPN traffic currently, validate that is what is expected based on your network design, and compare that with data from an earlier time to look for any differences.

To view switches and hosts with the most layer 2 EVPN sessions:

1. Open the large EVPN Service card.

2. Select **Switches with Most L2 EVPN** from the filter above the table.  

    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes running the most layer 2 EVPN sessions at the top. Scroll down to view those with the fewest sessions.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-evpn-large-summary-tab-most-l2evpn-300.png" width="500">}}

To compare this data with the same data at a previous time:

    You can now see whether there are significant differences between this time period and the previous time period.  

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/time-picker-popup-narrow-222.png" width="150">}}

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-evpn-large-summary-tab-most-l2-pst-mo-300.png" width="500">}}

If the changes are unexpected, you can investigate further by looking at another time frame, determining if more nodes are now running EVPN than previously, looking for changes in the topology, and so forth.

### View Devices with the Most Layer 3 EVPN Sessions

You can view the number layer 3 EVPN sessions on your switches and hosts using the large EVPN Service card. This data enables you to see which switches are handling the most EVPN traffic currently, validate that is what is expected based on your network design, and compare that with data from an earlier time to look for any differences.

To view switches and hosts with the most layer 3 EVPN sessions:

1. Open the large EVPN Service card.
