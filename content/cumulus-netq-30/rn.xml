<td>NETQ-6673</td>
<td><p>Infra: NetQ VM installation fails if the designated disk size is greater than 2TB. To work around this issue, specify the disk for cloud deployments to be between 256GB and 2TB SSD, and for on-premises deployments to be between 32 GB and 2TB.</p></td>

<td>NETQ-5833</td>
<td><p>Switch upgrade of Cumulus Linux in the lifecycle management feature fails when attempted by a user with a standard or sudo user role and custom password credentials. To work around this issue, upgrades should be performed by users with root or sudo user role and an SSH key. Optionally, upgrade using a root user role with custom password. </p></td>

<td>NETQ-5808</td>
<td><p>When upgrading to NetQ 3.0.0, if you are using NetQ Agent 2.3.1 or earlier and have MLAG configured, the MLAG service becomes unresponsive. To resolve this issue, upgrade your NetQ Agents to version 3.0.0.</p></td>

<tr>
<td>NETQ-5774</td>
<td><p>When installing NetQ on switches running in Cumulus Linux 3.7.x  with management VRF configured, the CLI and Agent server are configured as follows:</p>

netq config add cli server &lt;ipaddr&gt; vrf mgmt
netq config restart cli

netq config add agent server &lt;ipaddr&gt; vrf mgmt
netq config restart agent


<p>This results in netqd running in both default and management VRF and the NetQ Agent running in default VRF. In this scenario, the NetQ Agent status is not reported correctly to the management VRF. To workaround this issue: </p>


<p>If you have management VRF configured, run the following commands:</p>

systemctl stop netqd.service
systemctl disable netqd.service
systemctl enable netqd@mgmt.service
systemctl restart netqd@mgmt.service


<p>If you have default VRF configured, run the following commands:</p>

systemctl stop netqd@mgmt.service
systemctl disable netqd@mgmt.service
systemctl enable netqd.service
systemctl restart netqd.service

<td><p>UI: Warnings might appear during the post-upgrade phase for a Cumulus Linux switch upgrade job. They are caused by services that have not yet been restored by the time the job is complete. Cumulus Networks recommend waiting five minutes, creating a network snapshot, then comparing that to the pre-upgrade snapshot. If the comparison shows no differences for the services, the warnings can be ignored. If there are differences, then troubleshooting the relevant service(s) is recommended.</p></td>
