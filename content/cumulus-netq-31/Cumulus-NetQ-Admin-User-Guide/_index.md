- {{<link title="Application Management">}}: manage access to and various application-wide settings for the Cumulus NetQ UI from a single location
- {{<link title="Lifecycle Management">}}: manage deployment and perform operational tasks for Cumulus Linux and Cumulus NetQ products from the NetQ UI or CLI
