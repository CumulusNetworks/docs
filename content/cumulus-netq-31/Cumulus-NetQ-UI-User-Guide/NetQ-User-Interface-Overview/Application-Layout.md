## Recent Actions

To open Recent Actions, click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/05-Internet-Networks-Servers/01-Worldwide-Web/network-clock.svg" height="18" width="18"/>. Click on any of the actions to perform that action again.

## Cumulus Networks Logo

Clicking on the Cumulus logo takes you to your favorite workbench. For details about specifying your favorite workbench, refer to {{<link title="Set User Preferences">}}.

## Quick Network Health View

Found in the header, the graph and performance rating provide a view into the health of your network at a glance.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/quick-ntwk-health-header-222.png" width="200" >}}

{{<notice note>}}
On initial start up of the application, it may take up to an hour to reach an accurate health indication as some processes run every 30 minutes.
{{</notice>}}

## Local Time

By default, the time zone is set to the user's local time zone. If a time zone has not been selected, NetQ defaults to the current local time zone where NetQ is installed.  Click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/52-Arrows-Diagrams/01-Arrows/arrow-button-down-2.svg" height="18" width="18">}} to change the time zone or refer to {{<link title="Set User Preferences#configure-display-settings" text="Set User Preferences">}} for additional details.

## Premises Listing

The name of the location you are monitoring is presented in the Premises field of the application header. If you have more than one premises configured, you can select the premises for the data you want to see.  Click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/52-Arrows-Diagrams/01-Arrows/arrow-button-down-2.svg" height="18" width="18">}}, then select the desired premises. If you have a large number of premises, you can search for a premises by name. Simply start typing the name in the search box and suggestions are provided.

## Workbenches

A workbench is comprised of a given set of cards. A pre-configured default workbench, Cumulus Workbench, is available to get you started. It contains Device Inventory, Switch Inventory, Alarm and Info Events, and Network Health cards. On initial login, this workbench is opened. You can create your own workbenches and add or remove cards to meet your particular needs. For more detail about managing your data using workbenches, refer to {{<link title="Focus Your Monitoring Using Workbenches">}}.

## Cards

Cards present information about your network for monitoring and troubleshooting. This is where you can expect to spend most of your time. Each card describes a particular aspect of the network. Cards are available in multiple sizes, from small to full screen. The level of the content on a card varies in accordance with the size of the card, with the highest level of information on the smallest card to the most detailed information on the full-screen view. Cards are collected onto a workbench where you see all of the data relevant to a task or set of tasks. You can add and remove cards from a workbench, move between cards and card sizes, and make copies of cards to show different levels of data at the same time. For details about working with cards, refer to {{<link title="Access Data with Cards">}}.

## User Settings

Each user can customize the NetQ application display, change their account password, and manage their workbenches. This is all performed from User Settings <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/17-Users/19-Natural-Close%20Up-Single%20User-Man/single-man-circle.svg" height="18" width="18"/> > Profile & Preferences. For details, refer to {{<link title="Set User Preferences">}}.

Within the help menu, topics are grouped by categories:

- **How to...**: These items walk you through how to perform common tasks.
- **Tell me about...**: These items describe features of the application.
- **Where Can I Find...**: These items help you find and use features that may be harder to find than others in the application.
- **User Documentation**: This provides a link to the Cumulus NetQ user documentation. It opens in a separate window so you can have it open while working in the application.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/walkme-menu-300.png" width="300">}}

You can search for help items by collapsing and expanding categories or by searching. Click a category title to toggle between viewing and hiding the content. To search, begin entering text into the **Search** field to see suggested content.

{{<notice tip>}}
<strong>Is the help button covering content that you want to see?</strong>
The button can be dragged and dropped to various locations around the edge of the UI, so if you do not like it on the bottom left (default), you can move it to the bottom center, bottom right, right side bottom, etc. A green dashed border appears in the locations where it can be placed. Alternately, enlarge the NetQ UI application window or scroll within the window to view any hidden content.
