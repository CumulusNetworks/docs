After installing your Cumulus NetQ Platform or Collector software, the next step is to install NetQ switch software for all switches and host servers that you want to monitor in your network. This includes the NetQ Agent, and optionally the NetQ CLI. While the CLI is optional, it can be very useful to be able to access a switch or host through the command line for troubleshooting or device management. The telemetry data is sent by the NetQ Agent on a switch or host to your NetQ Platform or Collector on your NetQ On-premises or Cloud Appliance or VM.
