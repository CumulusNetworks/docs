This topic describes how to upgrade from your current NetQ 2.4.1-3.2.0 installation to the NetQ 3.2.1 release to take advantage of new capabilities and bug fixes (refer to the {{<link title="NVIDIA NetQ 3.2 Release Notes" text="release notes">}}).

You must upgrade your NetQ On-premises or Cloud Appliance(s) or Virtual Machines (VMs). While NetQ 2.x Agents are compatible with NetQ 3.x, upgrading NetQ Agents is always recommended. If you want access to new and updated commands, you can upgrade the CLI on your physical servers or VMs, and monitored switches and hosts as well.

To complete the upgrade for either an on-premises or a cloud deployment:

- Start with {{<link title="Upgrade NetQ Appliances and Virtual Machines">}}
- Then go to {{<link title="Upgrade NetQ Agents">}}
- Optionally, go to {{<link title="Upgrade NetQ CLI">}}
