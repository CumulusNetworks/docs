Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) is used to enable a server or switch with a two-port bond (such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel, port group or trunk) to connect those ports to different switches and operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput. Dual-connected devices can create LACP bonds that contain links to each physical switch. Therefore, active-active links from the dual-connected devices are supported even though they are connected to two different physical switches. For an overview and how to configure MLAG in your network, refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG/" text="Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation - MLAG">}}.

{{%notice note%}}

**MLAG or CLAG?**
The Cumulus Linux implementation of MLAG is referred to by other vendors as MLAG, MC-LAG or VPC. The Cumulus NetQ UI uses the MLAG terminology predominantly. However, the management daemon, named `clagd`, and other options in the code, such as `clag-id`, remain for historical purposes.

{{%/notice%}}

NetQ enables operators to view the health of the MLAG service on a networkwide and a per session basis, giving greater insight into all aspects of the service. This is accomplished in the NetQ UI through two card workflows, one for the service and one for the session and in the NetQ CLI with the `netq show mlag` command.

{{%notice tip%}}

If you have prior scripts or automation that use the older `netq show clag` command, they will still work as the command has not been removed yet.

## Monitor the MLAG Service Networkwide

With NetQ, you can monitor MLAG performance across the network:

- Network Services|All MLAG Sessions
    - Small: view number of nodes running MLAG service and number and distribution of alarms
    - Medium: view number of nodes running MLAG service, number and distribution of sessions and alarms, number of sessions with inactive backup IPs, and number of bonds with single connections
    - Large: view number of nodes running MLAG service, number of sessions and alarms, number of sessions with inactive backup IPs, switches with the most established/unestablished sessions, devices with the most alarms
    - Full-screen: view all switches, all sessions, and all alarms
- `netq show mlag` command: view host, peer, system MAC address, state, information about the bonds, and last time a change was made for each session running MLAG

{{%notice note%}}

When entering a time value in the `netq show mlag` command, you must include a numeric value *and* the unit of measure:

- **w**: week(s)
- **d**: day(s)
- **h**: hour(s)
- **m**: minute(s)
- **s**: second(s)
- **now**

When using the `between` option, the start time (`text-time`) and end time (`text-endtime`) values can be entered as most recent first and least recent second, or vice versa. The values do not have to have the same unit of measure.

### View Service Status Summary

You can view a summary of the MLAG service from the NetQ UI or the NetQ CLI.

{{< tabs "TabID54" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

To view the summary, open the small Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card. In this example, the number of devices running the MLAG service is 4 and no alarms are present.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-small-230.png" width="200" >}}

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

To view MLAG service status, run `netq show mlag`.

This example shows the Cumulus reference topology, where MLAG is configured on the border and leaf switches. You can view host, peer, system MAC address, state, information about the bonds, and last time a change was made for each MLAG session.

```

### View the Distribution of Sessions and Alarms

It is useful to know the number of network nodes running the MLAG protocol over a period of time, as it gives you insight into the amount of traffic associated with and breadth of use of the protocol. It is also useful to compare the number of nodes running MLAG with the alarms present at the same time to determine if there is any correlation between the issues and the ability to establish an MLAG session.

Nodes which have a large number of unestablished sessions might be misconfigured or experiencing communication issues. This is visible with the NetQ UI.

{{< tabs "TabID94" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

To view the distribution, open the medium Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-medium-230.png" width="200" >}}

This example shows the following for the last 24 hours:

- Four nodes have been running the MLAG protocol with no changes in that number
- Four sessions were established and remained so
- No MLAG-related alarms have occurred

If there was a visual correlation between the alarms and sessions, you could dig a little deeper with the large Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

To view the number of switches running the MLAG service, run:

```
netq show mlag
```

Count the switches in the output.

This example shows two border and four leaf switches, for a total of six switches running the protocol. The device in each session acting in the primary role is marked with (P).

### View Bonds with Only a Single Link

You can determine whether there are any bonds in your MLAG configuration with only a single link, instead of the usual two, using the NetQ UI or the NetQ CLI.

{{< tabs "TabID146" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

1. Open the medium Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

    This example shows that four bonds have single links.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-medium-sgllink-cnt-320.png" width="200">}}

2. Hover over the card and change to the full-screen card using the card size picker.

3. Click the **All Sessions** tab.

4. Browse the sessions looking for either a blank value in the **Dual Bonds** column, or with one or more bonds listed in the **Single Bonds** column, to determine whether or not the devices participating in these sessions are incorrectly configured.

5. Optionally, change the time period of the data on either size card to determine when the configuration may have changed from a dual to a single bond.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

Run the `netq show mlag` command to view bonds with single links in the last 24 hours. Use the `around` option to view bonds with single links for a time in the past.

This example shows that no bonds have single links, because the **#Bonds** value equals the **#Dual** value for all sessions.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show mlag

```

This example shows that more bonds were configured 30 days ago than in the last 24 hours, but still none of those bonds had single links.

### View Sessions with No Backup IP addresses Assigned

You can determine whether MLAG sessions have a backup IP address assigned and ready using the NetQ UI or NetQ CLI.

{{< tabs "TabID210" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

1. Open the medium Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

    This example shows that non of the bonds have single links.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-medium-bkupIP-320.png" width="200">}}

2. Hover over the card and change to the full-screen card using the card size picker.

3. Click the **All Sessions** tab.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-fullscr-bkupIP-320.png" width="700">}}

4. Look for the **Backup IP** column to confirm the IP address assigned if assigned.

5. Optionally, change the time period of the data on either size card to determine when a backup IP address was added or removed.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

Run `netq show mlag` to view the status of backup IP addresses for sessions.

This example shows that a backup IP has been configured and is currently reachable for all MLAG sessions because the **Backup** column indicates *up*.

### View Sessions with Conflicted Bonds

You can view sessions with conflicted bonds (bonds that conflict with existing bond relationships) in the NetQ UI.

To view these sessions:

1. Open the Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Hover over the card and change to the full-screen card using the card size picker.

3. Click the **All Sessions** tab.

4. Scroll to the right to view the **Conflicted Bonds** column. Based on the value/s in that field, reconfigure MLAG accordingly, using the `net add bond` NCLU command or edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file. Refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux-42/Layer-2/Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG/#basic-configuration" text="Basic Configuration">}} in the Cumulus Linux MLAG topic.

### View Devices with the Most MLAG Sessions

You can view the load from MLAG on your switches using the large Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card. This data enables you to see which switches are handling the most MLAG traffic currently, validate that is what is expected based on your network design, and compare that with data from an earlier time to look for any differences.

{{< tabs "TabID274" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

To view switches and hosts with the most MLAG sessions:

1. Open the large Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Select **Switches with Most Sessions** from the filter above the table.

    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes running the most MLAG sessions at the top. Scroll down to view those with the fewest sessions.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-large-most-sessions-230.png" width="500" >}}

To compare this data with the same data at a previous time:

1. Open another large Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Move the new card next to the original card if needed.

3. Change the time period for the data on the new card by hovering over the card and clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/18-Time/time-stopwatch.svg" height="18" width="18"/>.

4. Select the time period that you want to compare with the current time. You can now see whether there are significant differences between this time period and the previous time period.  

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/time-picker-popup-narrow-222.png" width="150" >}}

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-large-most-sessions-6hr-230.png" width="500" >}}

<div style="padding-left: 18px;">If the changes are unexpected, you can investigate further by looking at another time frame, determining if more nodes are now running MLAG than previously, looking for changes in the topology, and so forth.</div>

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

To determine the devices with the most sessions, run `netq show mlag`. Then count the sessions on each device.

In this example, there are two sessions between border01 and border02, two sessions between leaf01 and leaf02, and two session between leaf03 and leaf04. Therefore, no devices has more sessions that any other.

### View Devices with the Most Unestablished MLAG Sessions

You can identify switches that are experiencing difficulties establishing MLAG sessions; both currently and in the past, using the NetQ UI.

To view switches with the most unestablished MLAG sessions:

1. Open the large Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Select **Switches with Most Unestablished Sessions** from the filter above the table.

    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes with the most unestablished MLAG sessions at the top. Scroll down to view those with the fewest unestablished sessions.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-large-most-unestab-230.png" width="500" >}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options include:

- Change the time period for the data to compare with a prior time. If the same switches are consistently indicating the most unestablished sessions, you might want to look more carefully at those switches using the Switches card workflow to determine probable causes. Refer to {{<link title="Monitor Switch Performance">}}.
- Click **Show All Sessions** to investigate all MLAG sessions with events in the full-screen card.

### View MLAG Configuration Information for a Given Device

You can view the MLAG configuration information for a given device from the NetQ UI or the NetQ CLI.

{{< tabs "TabID353" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

1. Open the full-screen Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/15-Filter/filter-1.svg" height="18" width="18">}} to filter by hostname.

3. Click **Apply**.

    The sessions with the identified device as the primary, or host device in the MLAG pair, are listed. This example shows the sessions for the *leaf01* switch.

### View Switches with the Most MLAG-related Alarms

Switches experiencing a large number of MLAG alarms may indicate a configuration or performance issue that needs further investigation. You can view this information using the NetQ UI or NetQ CLI.

{{< tabs "TabID392" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

With the NetQ UI, you can view the switches sorted by the number of MLAG alarms and then use the Switches card workflow or the Events|Alarms card workflow to gather more information about possible causes for the alarms.

To view switches with most MLAG alarms:

1. Open the large Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Hover over the header and click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/20-Alert/alarm-bell.svg" height="18" width="18"/>.

3. Select **Events by Most Active Device** from the filter above the table.

    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes with the most MLAG alarms at the top. Scroll down to view those with the fewest alarms.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-large-alarms-tab-230.png" width="500" >}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options include:

- Change the time period for the data to compare with a prior time. If the same switches are consistently indicating the most alarms, you might want to look more carefully at those switches using the Switches card workflow.
- Click **Show All Sessions** to investigate all MLAG sessions with alarms in the full-screen card.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

To view the switches and hosts with the most MLAG alarms and informational events, run the `netq show events` command with the `type` option set to *clag*, and optionally the `between` option set to display the events within a given time range. Count the events associated with each switch.

This example shows that no MLAG events have occurred in the last 24 hours. Note that this command still uses the *clag* nomenclature.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show events type clag
No matching event records found
```

This example shows all MLAG events between now and 30 days ago, a total of 1 info event.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show events type clag between now and 30d
Matching events records:
Hostname          Message Type             Severity         Message                             Timestamp

### View All MLAG Events

The Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card workflow and the `netq show events type mlag` command enable you to view all of the MLAG events in a designated time period.

{{< tabs "TabID446" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

To view all MLAG events:

1. Open the Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Change to the full-screen card using the card size picker.

3. Click **All Alarms** tab.

    By default, events are listed in most recent to least recent order.
    
    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-all-mlag-fullscr-all-alarms-tab-241.png" width="700">}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options include:

- Sort on various parameters:
    - By **Message** to determine the frequency of particular events.
    - By **Severity** to determine the most critical events.
    - By **Time** to find events that may have occurred at a particular time to try to correlate them with other system events.
- Export the data to a file for use in another analytics tool by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/05-Internet-Networks-Servers/08-Upload-Download/upload-bottom.svg" height="18" width="18"/>.
- Return to your workbench by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/close.svg" height="14" width="14"/> in the top right corner.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

To view all MLAG alarms, run:

```
netq show events [level info | level error | level warning | level critical | level debug] type clag [between <text-time> and <text-endtime>] [json]
```

Use the `level` option to set the severity of the events to show.  Use the `between` option to show events within a given time range.

This example shows that no MLAG events have occurred in the last three days.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show events type clag between now and 3d
No matching event records found
```

This example shows that one MLAG event occurred in the last 30 days.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show events type clag between now and 30d

## Monitor a Single MLAG Session

With NetQ, you can monitor the number of nodes running the MLAG service, view switches with the most peers alive and not alive, and view alarms triggered by the MLAG service. For an overview and how to configure MLAG in your data center network, refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG/" text="Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation - MLAG">}}.

{{%notice note%}}

To access the single session cards, you must open the full-screen Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card, click the **All Sessions** tab, select the desired session, then click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/44-Entertainment-Events-Hobbies/02-Card-Games/card-game-diamond.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (Open Card).

{{%/notice%}}

### Granularity of Data Shown Based on Time Period

On the medium and large single MLAG session cards, the status of the peers is represented in heat maps stacked vertically; one for peers that are reachable (alive), and one for peers that are unreachable (not alive). Depending on the time period of data on the card, the number of smaller time blocks used to indicate the status varies. A vertical stack of time blocks, one from each map, includes the results from all checks during that time. The results are shown by how saturated the color is for each block. If all peers during that time period were alive for the entire time block, then the top block is 100% saturated (white) and the not alive block is zero percent saturated (gray). As peers that are not alive increase in saturation, the peers that are alive block is proportionally reduced in saturation. An example heat map for a time period of 24 hours is shown here with the most common time periods in the table showing the resulting time blocks.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-result-granularity-230.png" width="300">}}

| Time Period | Number of Runs | Number Time Blocks | Amount of Time in Each Block |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 6 hours     | 18             | 6                  | 1 hour                       |
| 12 hours    | 36             | 12                 | 1 hour                       |
| 24 hours    | 72             | 24                 | 1 hour                       |
| 1 week      | 504            | 7                  | 1 day                        |
| 1 month     | 2,086          | 30                 | 1 day                        |

### View Session Status Summary

A summary of the MLAG session is available about a given MLAG session using the NetQ UI or NetQ CLI.

{{< tabs "TabID600" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

A summary of the MLAG session is available from the Network Services|MLAG Session card workflow, showing the host and peer devices participating in the session, node role, peer role and state, the associated system MAC address, and the distribution of the MLAG session state.

To view the summary:

1. Open or add the Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Change to the full-screen card using the card size picker.

3. Click the **All Sessions** tab.

4. Select the session of interest, then click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/44-Entertainment-Events-Hobbies/02-Card-Games/card-game-diamond.svg"  height="18" width="18">}} (Open Card).

5. Locate the medium Network Services|MLAG Session card.

    {{<img src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-medium-summ-highlighted-bad-230.png" width="200" >}} {{<img src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-medium-summ-highlighted-230.png" width="200" >}}

<div style="padding-left: 18px;">In the left example, we see that the tor1 switch plays the secondary role in this session with the switch at 44:38:39:ff:01:01 and that there is an issue with this session. In the right example, we see that the leaf03 switch plays the primary role in this session with leaf04 and this session is in good health.</div>

6. Optionally, open the small Network Services|MLAG Session card to keep track of the session health.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-small-230.png" width="200">}}

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "NetQ CLI" >}}

Run the `netq show mlag` command with the `hostname` option.

This example shows the session information when the leaf01 switch is acting as the primary role in the session.

```

### View MLAG Session Peering State Changes

You can view the peering state for a given MLAG session from the medium and large MLAG Session cards. For a given time period, you can determine the stability of the MLAG session between two devices. If you experienced connectivity issues at a particular time, you can use these cards to help verify the state of the peer. If the peer was not alive more than it was alive, you can then investigate further into possible causes.

To view the state transitions for a given MLAG session on the *medium* card:

1. Open the or add the Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Change to the full-screen card using the card size picker.

3. Click the **All Sessions** tab.

4. Select the session of interest, then click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/44-Entertainment-Events-Hobbies/02-Card-Games/card-game-diamond.svg"  height="18" width="18">}} (Open Card).

5. Locate the medium Network Services|MLAG Session card.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-medium-chart-highlighted-230.png" width="200">}}

    In this example, the heat map tells us that the peer switch has been alive for the entire 24-hour period.

    From this card, you can also view the node role, peer role and state, and MLAG system MAC address which identify the session in more detail.

To view the peering state transitions for a given MLAG session on the *large* Network Services|MLAG Session card:

1. Open a Network Services|MLAG Session card.

2. Hover over the card, and change to the large card using the card size picker.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-large-session-tab-chart-highlighted-320.png" width="500">}}

    From this card, you can also view the alarm and info event counts, node role, peer role, state, and interface, MLAG system MAC address, active backup IP address, single, dual, conflicted, and protocol down bonds, and the VXLAN anycast address identifying the session in more detail.

### View Changes to the MLAG Service Configuration File

Each time a change is made to the configuration file for the MLAG service, NetQ logs the change and enables you to compare it with the last version using the NetQ UI. This can be useful when you are troubleshooting potential causes for alarms or sessions losing their connections.

To view the configuration file changes:

1. Open or add the Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.

2. Switch to the full-screen card using the card size picker.

3. Click the **All Sessions** tab.

4. Select the session of interest, then click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/44-Entertainment-Events-Hobbies/02-Card-Games/card-game-diamond.svg"  height="18" width="18">}} (Open Card).

5. Locate the medium Network Services|MLAG Session card.

6. Hover over the card, and change to the large card using the card size picker.

7. Hover over the card and click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/16-Files-Folders/01-Common-Files/common-file-settings-1.svg" height="18" width="18"/> to open the **Configuration File Evolution** tab.

8. Select the time of interest on the left; when a change may have impacted the performance. Scroll down if needed.

9. Choose between the **File** view and the **Diff** view (selected option is dark; File by default).  

    The File view displays the content of the file for you to review.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-large-config-tab-file-230.png" width="500">}}

    The Diff view displays the changes between this version (on left) and the most recent version (on right) side by side. The changes are highlighted in red and green. In this example, we don't have any changes after this first creation, so the same file is shown on both sides and no highlighting is present.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/ntwk-svcs-single-mlag-large-config-tab-diff-230.png" width="500">}}

### All MLAG Session Details

You can view attributes of all of the MLAG sessions  for the devices participating in a given session with the NetQ UI and the NetQ CLI.

{{< tabs "TabID715" >}}

{{< tab "NetQ UI" >}}

To view all session details:

1. Open or add the Network Services|All MLAG Sessions card.
