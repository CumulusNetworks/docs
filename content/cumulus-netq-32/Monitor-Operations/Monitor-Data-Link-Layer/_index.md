With NetQ, a user can monitor OSI Layer 2 devices and protocols, including switches, bridges, link control, and physical media access. Keeping track of the various data link layer devices in your network ensures consistent and error-free communications between devices.

It helps answer questions such as:

- Is a VLAN misconfigured?
- Is MLAG configured correctly?
- Is LLDP running on all of my devices?
- Is there an STP loop?
- What is the status of interfaces on a device?
- Where has a given MAC address lived in my network?
