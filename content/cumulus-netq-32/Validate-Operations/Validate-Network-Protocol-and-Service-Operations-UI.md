NetQ lets you validate the operation of the network protocols and services running in your network either on demand or on a scheduled basis.

For a more general understanding of how well your network is operating, refer to the {{<link title="Validate Overall Network Health">}} topic.

## Create Validation Requests

The Validation Request card workflow is used to create on-demand validation requests to evaluate the health of your network protocols and services.

### Validation Request Card Workflow

The small Validation Request card displays:

### Create On-demand and Scheduled Validation Requests

There are several types of validation requests that a user can make. Each has a slightly different flow through the Validation Request card,
and is therefore described separately. The types are based on the intent of the request:

- {{<link url="#run-an-existing-scheduled-validation-request-on-demand" text="Run an Existing Scheduled Validation Request On Demand">}}
- {{<link url="#create-a-new-on-demand-validation-request" text="Create a New On-demand Validation Request">}}
- {{<link url="#create-a-new-scheduled-validation-request" text="Create a New Scheduled Validation Request">}}
- {{<link url="#modify-an-existing-scheduled-validation-request" text="Modify an Existing Scheduled Validation Request">}}

### Run an Existing Scheduled Validation Request On Demand

You may find that although you have a validation scheduled to run at a later time, you would like to run it now.

To run a scheduled validation now:

1. Open either the small, medium, or large Validation Request card.
2. Select the validation from the **Validation** dropdown list.  

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-small-plus-medium-selection-230.png" width="420" >}}
    {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-large-valid-selection-222.png" width="500" >}}

3. Click **Go** or **Run Now**.  
    The associated Validation Result card is opened on your workbench. Refer to {{<link url="#view-on-demand-validation-results" text="View On-demand Validation Results">}}.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-medium-default-bgp-running-230.png" width="200" >}}

### Create a New On-demand Validation Request

When you want to validate the operation of one or more network protocols and services right now, you can create and run an on-demand validation
request using the large Validation Request card.

To create and run a request for *a single* protocol or service:

1. Open the small, medium or large Validation Request card.
2. Select the validation from the **Validation** dropdown list.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-selection.png" width="300" >}}

3. Click **Go** or **Run Now**.  
    The associated Validation Result card is opened on your workbench. Refer to {{<link url="#view-on-demand-validation-results" text="View On-demand Validation Results">}}.

To create and run a request for *more than one* protocol and/or service:

1. Open the large Validation Request card.

2. Click the names of the protocols and services you want to validate.
    We selected BGP and EVPN in this example.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-bgp-evpn-222.png" width="500" >}}

3. Click **Run Now** to start the validation.  
    The associated on-demand validation result cards (one per protocol or service selected) are opened on your current workbench. Refer to {{<link url="#view-on-demand-validation-results" text="View On-demand Validation Results">}}.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-medium-bgpevpn-running-230.png" width="420" >}}

### Create a New Scheduled Validation Request

When you want to see validation results on a regular basis, it is useful to configure a scheduled validation request to avoid re-creating the
request each time.

To create and run a new scheduled validation:

1. Open the large Validation Request card.
2. Select the protocols and/or services you want to include in the validation. In this example we have chosen the Agents and NTP services.

      {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-agents-ntp-222.png" width="500" >}}

3. Enter the schedule frequency (30 min, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, or 1 day) by selecting it from the **Run every** list. Default is hourly.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/schedule-frequency-selection-222.png" width="300" >}}

4. Select the time to start the validation runs, by clicking in the Starting field. Select a day and click **Next**, then select the starting time and click **OK**.  

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/date-selection-222.png" width="150">}}
    <p> </p>
    {{< figure src="/images/netq/time-selection-222.png" width="150">}}

5. Verify the selections were made correctly.
6. Click **Save As New**.

      {{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-agents-ntp-save-as-new-222.png" width="500" >}}

7. Enter a name for the validation.

      {{%notice note%}}
Spaces and special characters are *not* allowed in validation request names.
      {{%/notice%}}

      {{< figure src="/images/netq/save-valid-name-example.png" width="250" >}}

8. Click **Save**.

The validation can now be selected from the Validation listing (on the small, medium or large size card) and run immediately using **Run Now**, or you can wait for it to run the first time according to the schedule you specified. Refer to {{<link url="#view-scheduled-validation-results" text="View Scheduled Validation Results">}}. Note that the number of scheduled validations is now two (2).

{{< figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-select-sched-222.png" width="500">}}

### Modify an Existing Scheduled Validation Request

At some point you might want to change the schedule or validation types that are specified in a scheduled validation request.

{{%notice info%}}
When you update a scheduled request, the results for all future runs of the validation will be different than the results of previous runs of the validation.
{{%/notice%}}

To modify a scheduled validation:

1. Open the large Validation Request card.
2. Select the validation from the **Validation** dropdown list.
3. Edit the schedule or validation types.
4. Click **Update**.

The validation can now be selected from the Validation listing (on the small, medium or large size card) and run immediately using **Run Now**, or you can wait for it to run the first time according to the schedule you specified. Refer to {{<link url="#view-scheduled-validation-results" text="View Scheduled Validation Results">}}.

## View On-demand Validation Results

The On-demand Validation Result card workflow enables you to view the results of on-demand validation requests. When a request has started processing, the associated medium Validation Result card is displayed on your workbench. When multiple network protocols or services are included in a validation, a validation result card is opened for each protocol and service.

### View On-demand Validation Results

Once an on-demand validation request has completed, the results are available in the corresponding Validation Result card.

{{<notice tip>}}
It may take a few minutes for all results to be presented if the load on the NetQ Platform is heavy at the time of the run.
{{</notice>}}

To view the results:

1. Locate the medium on-demand Validation Result card on your workbench for the protocol or service that was run.  

    You can identify it by the on-demand result icon, <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/35-Health-Beauty/07-Monitoring/monitor-heart-beat-search.svg" height="18" width="18"/>, protocol or service name, and the date and time that it was run.  

    **Note:** You may have more than one card open for a given protocol or service, so be sure to use the date and time on the card to     ensure you are viewing the correct card.  

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-medium-date-highlight-230.png" width="420" >}}

2. Note the total number and distribution of results for the tested devices and sessions (when appropriate). Are there many failures?

3. Hover over the charts to view the total number of warnings or failures and what percentage of the total results that represents for both devices and sessions.

4. Switch to the large on-demand Validation Result card.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-large-230.png" width="500" >}}

5. If there are a large number of device warnings or failures, view the devices with the most issues in the table on the right. By default, this table displays the **Most Active** devices. Click on a device name to open its switch card on your workbench.

6. To view the most recent issues, select **Most Recent** from the filter above the table.

7. If there are a large number of devices or sessions with warnings or failures, the protocol or service may be experiencing issues. View     the health of the protocol or service as a whole by clicking **Open** \<*network service*\> **Card** when available.

8. To view all data available for all on-demand validation results for a given protocol, switch to the full screen card.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-fullscr-300.png" width="700" >}}

9. Double-click in a given result row to open details about the validation.

    From this view you can:
    - See a summary of the validation results by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/52-Arrows-Diagrams/01-Arrows/arrow-button-right-2.svg" width="14" height="14"/> in the banner under the title. Toggle the arrow to close the summary.

        {{< figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-details-summary-fullscr.png" width="300" >}}

    - See detailed results of each test run to validate the protocol or service. When errors or warnings are present, the nodes and relevant detail is provided.

        {{< figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-tests-fullscr.png" width="700" >}}
    
    - Export the data by clicking **Export**.

    - Return to the validation jobs list by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/close.svg" width="14" height="14"/>.

    You may find that comparing various results gives you a clue as to why certain devices are experiencing more warnings or failures. For     example, more failures occurred between certain times or on a particular device.

## View Scheduled Validation Results

The Scheduled Validation Result card workflow enables you to view the results of scheduled validation requests. When a request has completed processing, you can access the Validation Result card from the full screen Validation Request card. Each protocol and service has its own validation result card, but the content is similar on each.

### Granularity of Data Shown Based on Time Period

On the medium and large Validation Result cards, the status of the runs is represented in heat maps stacked vertically; one for passing runs,  one for runs with warnings, and one for runs with failures. Depending on the time period of data on the card, the number of smaller time blocks used to indicate the status varies. A vertical stack of time blocks, one from each map, includes the results from all checks during that time. The results are shown by how saturated the color is for each block. If all validations during that time period pass, then the middle block is 100% saturated (white) and the warning and failure blocks are zero % saturated (gray). As warnings and errors increase in saturation, the passing block is proportionally reduced in saturation. An example heat map for a time period of 24 hours is shown here with the most common time periods in the table showing the resulting time blocks and regions.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-granularity-230.png" width="300">}}

| Time Period | Number of Runs | Number Time Blocks | Amount of Time in Each Block |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 6 hours     | 18             | 6                  | 1 hour                       |
| 12 hours    | 36             | 12                 | 1 hour                       |
| 24 hours    | 72             | 24                 | 1 hour                       |
| 1 week      | 504            | 7                  | 1 day                        |
| 1 month     | 2,086          | 30                 | 1 day                        |
| 1 quarter   | 7,000          | 13                 | 1 week                       |

### View Scheduled Validation Results

Once a scheduled validation request has completed, the results are available in the corresponding Validation Result card.

To view the results:

1. Open the full size Validation Request card to view all scheduled validations.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-fullscr-300.png" width="700">}}

2. Select the validation results you want to view by clicking in the first column of the result and clicking the check box.

3. On the Edit Menu that appears at the bottom of the window, click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/44-Entertainment-Events-Hobbies/02-Card-Games/card-game-diamond.svg" height="18" width="18"/> (Open Cards). This opens the medium Scheduled Validation Results card(s) for the selected items.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-medium-222.png" width="425">}}

4. Note the distribution of results. Are there many failures? Are they concentrated together in time? Has the protocol or service recovered     after the failures?

5. Hover over the heat maps to view the status numbers and what percentage of the total results that represents for a given region. The tooltip also shows the number of devices included in the validation and the number with warnings and/or failures. This is useful when you see the failures occurring on a small set of devices, as it might point to an issue with the devices rather than the network service.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-medium-bgp-popup-222.png" width="200">}}

6. Optionally, click **Open** \<*network service*\> **Card** link to open the medium individual Network Services card. Your current card is not closed.

7. Switch to the large Scheduled Validation card.

8. Click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/53-Resize/expand-horizontal-3.svg" height="18" width="18"/> to expand the chart.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-large-bgp-expand-chart-230.png" width="500">}}

9. Collapse the heat map by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/53-Resize/expand-horizontal-3.svg" height="18" width="18"/>.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-large-bgp-collapse-chart-230.png" width="500">}}

10. If there are a large number of warnings or failures, view the devices with the most issues by clicking **Most Active** in the filter above the table. This might help narrow the failures down to a particular device or small set of devices that you can investigate further.

11. Select the **Most Recent** filter above the table to see the events that have occurred in the near past at the top of the list.

12. Optionally, view the health of the protocol or service as a whole by clicking **Open** \<*network service*\> **Card** (when available).

13. You can view the configuration of the request that produced the results shown on this card workflow, by hovering over the card and     clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/12-Settings/cog-1.svg" height="18" width="18"/>. If you want to change the configuration, click **Edit Config** to open the large Validation Request card, pre-populated with the current configuration. Follow the instructions in {{<link url="#modify-an-existing-scheduled-validation-request" text="Modify an Existing Scheduled Validation Request">}} to make your changes.

14. To view all data available for all scheduled validation results for the given protocol or service, click **Show All Results** or switch to the full screen card.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-fullscr-bgp-241.png" width="700" >}}

15. Look for changes and patterns in the results. Scroll to the right. Are there more failed sessions or nodes during one or more validations?

16. Double-click in a given result row to open details about the validation.

    From this view you can:
    - See a summary of the validation results by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/52-Arrows-Diagrams/01-Arrows/arrow-button-right-2.svg" width="14" height="14"/> in the banner under the title. Toggle the arrow to close the summary.

        {{< figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-details-summary-fullscr.png" width="300" >}}

    - See detailed results of each test run to validate the protocol or service. When errors or warnings are present, the nodes and relevant detail is provided.

        {{< figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-tests-fullscr.png" width="700" >}}

    - Export the data by clicking **Export**.

    - Return to the validation jobs list by clicking <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/close.svg" width="14" height="14"/>.

    You may find that comparing various results gives you a clue as to why certain devices are experiencing more warnings or failures. For  example, more failures occurred between certain times or on a particular device.
