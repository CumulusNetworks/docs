## Validate Physical Layer Configuration

Beyond knowing what physical components are deployed, it is valuable to
know that they are configured and operating correctly. NetQ enables you
to confirm that peer connections are present, discover any misconfigured
ports, peers, or unsupported modules, and monitor for link flaps.

NetQ checks peer connections using LLDP. For DACs and AOCs, NetQ
determines the peers using their serial numbers in the port EEPROMs,
even if the link is not UP.

### Confirm Peer Connections

You can validate peer connections for all devices in your network or for
a specific device or port. This example shows the peer hosts and their
status for leaf03 switch.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf03 show interfaces physical peer
Matching cables records:
Hostname          Interface                 Peer Hostname     Peer Interface            State      Message
----------------- ------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------- ---------- -----------------------------------
leaf03            swp1                      oob-mgmt-switch   swp7                      up                                
leaf03            swp2                                                                  down       Peer port unknown                             
leaf03            swp47                     leaf04            swp47                     up                                
leaf03            swp48                     leaf04            swp48                     up              
leaf03            swp49                     leaf04            swp49                     up                                
leaf03            swp50                     leaf04            swp50                     up                                
leaf03            swp51                     exit01            swp51                     up                                
leaf03            swp52                                                                 down       Port cage empty                                
```

This example shows the peer data for a specific interface port.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf01 show interfaces physical swp47
Matching cables records:
Hostname          Interface                 Peer Hostname     Peer Interface            State      Message
----------------- ------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------- ---------- -----------------------------------
leaf01            swp47                     leaf02            swp47                     up   
```

### Discover Misconfigurations

You can verify that the following configurations are the same on both
sides of a peer interface:

  - Admin state
  - Operational state
  - Link speed
  - Auto-negotiation setting

The `netq check interfaces` command is used to determine if any of the
interfaces have any continuity errors. This command only checks the
physical interfaces; it does not check bridges, bonds or other software
constructs. You can check all interfaces at once. It enables you to
compare the current status of the interfaces, as well as their status at
an earlier point in time. The command syntax is:

```
netq check interfaces [around <text-time>] [json]
```

{{%notice tip%}}

If NetQ cannot determine a peer for a given device, the port is marked
as *unverified*.

{{%/notice%}}

If you find a misconfiguration, use the `netq show interfaces physical`
command for clues about the cause.

**Example: Find Mismatched Operational States**

In this example, we check all of the interfaces for misconfigurations
and we find that one interface port has an error. We look for clues
about the cause and see that the Operational states do not match on the
connection between leaf 03 and leaf04: leaf03 is up, but leaf04 is down.
If the misconfiguration was due to a mismatch in the administrative
state, the message would have been *Admin state mismatch (up, down)* or
*Admin state mismatch (down, up)*.

**Example: Find Mismatched Peers**

This example uses the *and* keyword to check the connections between two
peers. An error is seen, so we check the physical peer information and
discover that the incorrect peer has been specified. After fixing it, we
run the check again, and see that there are no longer any interface
errors.

**Example: Find Mismatched Link Speeds**

This example checks for for configuration mismatches and finds a link
speed mismatch on server03. The link speed on swp49 is *40G* and the
peer port swp50 is *unspecified*.

    cumulus@switch:~$ netq check interfaces
    Checked Nodes: 10, Failed Nodes: 1
    Checked Ports: 125, Failed Ports: 2, Unverified Ports: 35

    server03          swp50                     server03          swp49                     Speed mismatch (Unknown, 40G)  

**Example: Find Mismatched Auto-negotiation Settings**

This example checks for configuration mismatches and finds
auto-negotation setting mismatches between the servers and leafs.
Auto-negotiation is *off* on the leafs, but *on* on the servers.

    cumulus@switch:~$ netq check interfaces

    leaf02            swp2                      server02          eth2                      Autoneg mismatch (off, on)

### Identify Flapping Links

You can also determine whether a link is flapping using the `netq check
interfaces` command. If a link is flapping, NetQ indicates this in a
message:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check interfaces
Checked Nodes: 18, Failed Nodes: 8
Checked Ports: 741, Failed Ports: 1, Unverified Ports: 414
 
Matching cables records:

                                                                                        mins                    
```
