NetQ provides the information you need to validate the health of your network fabric, devices, and interfaces. Whether you use the NetQ UI or the NetQ CLI to create and run validations, the underlying checks are the same. The number of checks and the type of checks are tailored to the particular protocol or element being validated.

## NetQ Agent Validation Tests

NetQ Agent validation looks for an agent status of Rotten for each node in the network. A *Fresh* status indicates the Agent is running as expected. The Agent sends a heartbeat every 30 seconds, and if three consecutive heartbeats are missed, its status changes to *Rotten*. This is accomplished with the following test:

| Test Number | Test Name | Description |
| :---------: | --------- | ----------- |
| 0 | Agent Health | Checks for nodes that have failed or lost communication |
