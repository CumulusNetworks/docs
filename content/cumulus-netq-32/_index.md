NVIDIA® Cumulus® NetQ is a highly-scalable, modern network operations tool set utilizes telemetry for deep troubleshooting, visibility, and automated workflows from a single GUI interface, reducing maintenance and network downtimes. It combines the ability to easily upgrade, configure and deploy network elements with a full suite of operations capabilities, such as visibility, troubleshooting, validation, trace and comparative look-back functionality.

This guide is intended for network administrators who are responsible for deploying, configuring, monitoring and troubleshooting the network in their data center or campus environment. NetQ {{<version>}} offers the ability to easily monitor and manage your network infrastructure and operational health. This guide provides instructions and information about monitoring individual components of the network, the network as a whole, and the NetQ software applications using the NetQ command line interface (NetQ CLI),  NetQ (graphical) user interface (NetQ UI), and NetQ Admin UI.
