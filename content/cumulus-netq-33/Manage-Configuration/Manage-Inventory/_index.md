This topic describes how to use the NetQ UI and CLI to monitor your inventory from networkwide and device-specific perspectives.

You can monitor all of the hardware and software components installed and running on the switches and hosts across the entire network. This is extremely useful for understanding the dependence on various vendors and versions, when planning upgrades or the scope of any other required changes.

From a networkwide view, you can monitor all of the switches and hosts at once, or you can monitor all of the switches at once. You cannot currently monitor all hosts at once separate from switches.
