To collect network telemetry data, the NetQ Agents must be installed on the relevant switches and hosts. It is a time saving process to update the NetQ Agent and CLI at the same time, but is not required. It always recommended that the NetQ Agents be updated. The NetQ CLI is optional, but can be very useful.

Use the instructions in the following sections based on the OS installed on the switch or server to install both the NetQ Agent and the CLI at the same time.
