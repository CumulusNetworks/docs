The next installation consideration is whether you want to deploy a single server or a server cluster on your premises. Both options provide the same services and features. The biggest difference is in the number of servers to be deployed and in the continued availability of services running on those servers should hardware failures occur.

A single server is easier to set up, configure and manage, but can limit your ability to scale your network monitoring quickly. Multiple servers is a bit more complicated, but you limit potential downtime and increase availability by having more than one server that can run the software and store the data.

Click the server arrangement you want to use to continue with installation:
