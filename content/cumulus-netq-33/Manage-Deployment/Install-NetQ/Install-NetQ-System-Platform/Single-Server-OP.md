The next installation consideration is whether you plan to use the NetQ On-premises Appliance or your own server with a VM. Both options provide the same services and features. The difference is in the implementation. When you choose to install NetQ software on your own hardware, you create and maintain a KVM or VMware VM, and the software is run from there. This requires you to scope and order an appropriate hardware server to support the NetQ requirements, but may allow you to reuse an existing server in your stock.

When you choose to purchase and install a NetQ On-premises Appliance, the initial configuration of the server with Ubuntu OS is already done for you, and the NetQ software components are pre-loaded, saving you time during the physical deployment.

Click the system setup you want to use to continue with installation:
