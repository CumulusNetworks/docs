A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) enables devices on one or more LANs to communicate as if they were on the same network, without being physically connected. The VLAN enables network administrators to partition a network for functional or security requirements without changing physical infrastructure. For an overview and how to configure VLANs in your network, refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux-42/Layer-2/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/" text="Ethernet Bridging - VLANs">}}.

With the NetQ CLI, you can view the operation of VLANs for one or all devices. You can also view the information at an earlier point in time or view changes that have occurred to the information during a specified time frame. NetQ enables you to view basic VLAN information for your devices using the `netq show vlan` command. Additional show commands provide information about VLAN interfaces, MAC addresses associated with VLANs, and events.

The syntax for these commands is:

```
netq [<hostname>] show vlan [<1-4096>] [around <text-time>] [json]

netq show interfaces type vlan [state <remote-interface-state>] [around <text-time>] [json]
netq <hostname> show interfaces type vlan [state <remote-interface-state>] [around <text-time>] [count] [json]

netq show macs [<mac>] [vlan <1-4096>] [origin] [around <text-time>] [json]
netq <hostname> show macs [<mac>] [vlan <1-4096>] [origin | count] [around <text-time>] [json]
netq <hostname> show macs egress-port <egress-port> [<mac>] [vlan <1-4096>] [origin] [around <text-time>] [json]

netq [<hostname>] show events [level info | level error | level warning | level critical | level debug] type vlan [between <text-time> and <text-endtime>] [json]
```

{{%notice note%}}

When entering a time value, you must include a numeric value *and* the unit of measure:

- **w**: week(s)
- **d**: day(s)
- **h**: hour(s)
- **m**: minute(s)
- **s**: second(s)
- **now**

When using the `between` option, the start time (`text-time`) and end time (`text-endtime`) values can be entered as most recent first and least recent second, or vice versa. The values do not have to have the same unit of measure.

{{%/notice%}}

## View VLAN Information for All Devices

You can view the configuration information for all VLANs in your network by running the `netq show vlan` command. It lists VLANs by device, and indicates any switch virtual interfaces (SVIs) configured and the last time this configuration was changed.

This example shows the VLANs configured across a network based on the Cumulus Networks reference architecture.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show vlan
Matching vlan records:
Hostname          VLANs                     SVIs                      Last Changed

```

## View ALL VLAN Information for a Given Device

You can view the configuration information for all VLANs running on a specific device using the `netq <hostname> show vlan` command. It lists VLANs running on the device, the ports used, whether an SVI is configured, and the last time this configuration was changed.

This example shows the VLANs configured on the *leaf02* switch.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf02 show vlan
Matching vlan records:

```

## View Information for a Given VLAN

You can view the configuration information for a particular VLAN using the `netq show vlan <vlan-id>` command. The ID must be a number between 1 and 4096.

This example shows that vlan *10* is running on the two border and four leaf switches.

```
cumulus@switch~$ netq show vlan 10
Matching vlan records:

```

## View VLAN Information for a Time in the Past

You can view the VLAN configuration information across the network or for a given device at a time in the past using the `around` option of the `netq show vlan` command. This can be helpful when you think there may have been changes made.

This example shows the VLAN configuration in the last 24 hours and 30 days ago. Note that some SVIs have been removed.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show vlan
Matching vlan records:

This example shows the VLAN configuration on *leaf02* in the last 24 hours and one week ago. In this case, no changes are present.

## View VLAN Interface Information

You can view the current or past state of the interfaces associated with
VLANs using the `netq show interfaces` command. This provides the status
of the interface, its specified MTU, whether it is running over a VRF,
and the last time it was changed.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show interfaces type vlan

## View the Number of VLAN Interfaces Configured

You can view the number of VLAN interfaces configured for a given device using the `netq show vlan` command with the `hostname` and `count` options.

This example shows the count of VLAN interfaces on the *leaf02* switch in the last 24 hours.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf02 show interfaces type vlan count
Count of matching link records: 6
```

### View MAC Addresses Associated with a VLAN

You can determine the MAC addresses associated with a given VLAN using
the `netq show macs vlan` command. The command also provides the
hostnames of the devices, the egress port for the interface, whether the
MAC address originated from the given device, whether it learns the MAC
address from the peer (remote=yes), and the last time the configuration
was changed.

This example shows the MAC addresses associated with VLAN *10*.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show macs vlan 10
Matching mac records:
Origin MAC Address        VLAN   Hostname          Egress Port                    Remote Last Changed

### View MAC Addresses Associated with an Egress Port

You can filter that information down to just the MAC addresses on a device that are associated with a given VLAN that use a particular egress port. Use the `netq <hostname> show macs` command with the `egress-port` and `vlan` options.

This example shows MAC addresses associated with the *leaf02* switch and
VLAN *10* that use the *bridge* port.

```
cumulus@netq-ts:~$ netq leaf02 show macs egress-port bridge vlan 10
Matching mac records:

```

### View the MAC Addresses Associated with VRR Configurations

You can view all of the MAC addresses associated with your VRR (virtual router reflector) interface configuration using the `netq show interfaces type macvlan` command. This is useful for determining if the specified MAC address inside a VLAN is the same or different across your VRR configuration.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show interfaces type macvlan
Matching mac records:
Origin MAC Address        VLAN   Hostname          Egress Port                    Remote Last Changed
