There are three sets of validation commands, all for verifying the health and performance of network protocols and services:

- The original on-demand validation commands. These commands all begin with `netq check`. They are used to validate various elements in your network fabric at the current time or a time in the past. They allow filtering by hostname, can include or exclude selected tests, and some have additional options. The results are presented in the NetQ CLI immediately.
- The newer set of validation commands are used to create on-demand or scheduled validations with the results being displayed in the NetQ UI Validation Result cards. These commands begin with `netq add validation`. They are used to validate various elements in your network fabric currently or on a regular basis. No filtering on results is available within the commands as that is accomplished through the NetQ UI.
- The validation management commands. These present a list of all jobs and job settings, and the ability to remove validations.

Refer to {{<link title="Validation Checks">}} for a description of the tests run as part of each validation. The commands are described here in alphabetical order, regardless of membership in one of the three sets above.

## On-demand

These commands are used to create and run on-demand validations.

### netq add validation

Creates an on-demand validation for various protocols and services, with results displayed in the associated On-demand Validation Result cards in the NetQ UI.

#### Syntax

```

### netq check bgp

Validates that all configured route peering is established in your network fabric by looking for consistency across BGP sessions; in particular, whether duplicate router IDs exist and if any sessions are in the unestablished state. If you have nodes that implement virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), you can request status based on the relevant routing table. VRF is commonly configured in multi-tenancy deployments to maintain separate domains for each tenant.

The output displays the status (passed/failed/skipped) of all tests and a summary including:

- Total number of nodes found
- Number of nodes validated
- Number of nodes that failed the validation
- Number of nodes that have not been heard from in 90 seconds (rotten)
- Number of nodes with warnings
- Total number of BGP sessions at the specified time
- Number of sessions that have failed to establish a connection

#### Syntax

```
netq check bgp
    [label <text-label-name> | hostnames <text-list-hostnames>]
    [vrf <vrf>]

### netq check license

Verifies license status for all nodes (leafs, spines, and hosts) in your network fabric. In particular, it looks for the validity of the Cumulus Linux license on each node.

The output displays the status (passed/failed/skipped) of all tests and a summary including:

- Total number of nodes found
- Number of nodes validated
- Number of nodes that failed validation
- Number of nodes that have not been heard from in 90 seconds (rotten)
- Number of nodes with warnings
- Number of licenses validated
- Number of licenses that failed validation

#### Syntax

```
netq check license
    [label <text-label-name> | hostnames <text-list-hostnames>]
    [include <license-number-range-list> | exclude <license-number-range-list>]

### netq check mtu

Verifies consistency of the maximum transmission unit (MTU) across all links in your network fabric. MTU consistency is verified at the level that is appropriate to the specific type of link. For example, bond interfaces have their MTU enforced at the bond level and not at the individual slave level. For MLAG/CLAG bonds, verification confirms whether or not both ends of the bond have the same MTU value configured for their local instance of the bond. You can also view nodes without a peer link.

The output displays the status (passed/failed/skipped) of all tests and a summary including:

- Total number of nodes found
- Number of nodes validated
- Number of nodes that failed validation
- Number of nodes that have not been heard from in 90 seconds (rotten)
- Number of nodes with warnings
- Number of links validated
- Number of links that failed validation
- Number of links that had warnings

#### Syntax

```
netq check mtu
    [label <text-label-name> | hostnames <text-list-hostnames>]

### netq check ntp

Verifies network time synchronization using NTP for all nodes (leafs, spines, and hosts) in your network fabric. Nodes that are not in time sychronization with the NetQ appliance or VM may report data with an incorrect timestamp or lose communication altogether.

The output displays the status (passed/failed/skipped) of all tests and a summary including:

- Total number of nodes found
- Number of nodes validated
- Number of nodes that failed validation
- Number of nodes that have not been heard from in 90 seconds (rotten)
- Number of nodes with warnings
- Number of nodes found that are unknown to NetQ
- Number of NTP servers available for synchronization

#### Syntax

```
netq check ntp [label <text-label-name> | hostnames <text-list-hostnames>] [include <ntp-number-range-list> | exclude <ntp-number-range-list>] [around <text-time>] [json | summary]

netq add validation
    name <text-new-validation-name>
    type (ntp | interfaces | license | sensors | evpn | vxlan | agents | mlag | vlan | bgp | mtu | ospf)
