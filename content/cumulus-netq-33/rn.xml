<td><p>Infra: In an on-premises deployment, the Kafka change logs can fill the NetQ appliance or VM disk space rapidly on systems with a large number of MAC or neighbor entries. If the disk usage exceeds 90%, the NetQ service is partially or completely disrupted. To workaround this issue, reduce the retention setting for log cleanup to 30 minutes by running the following script on your NetQ appliance/VM or the master server in a clustered arrangement:</p>

<td><p>CLI: For an on-premises deployment, an access_key and secret_key are not needed for the CLI to access the NetQ Collector. When these keys are configured NetQ assumes the system is in a cloud deployment and tries to validate the SSL certificates. This fails because for NetQ Collectors, the SSL certificates are usually self signed. As a result, the CLI fails with the following error:</p>


cumulus@switch:~# netq show agents
Failed to process command. Check /var/log/netqd.log for more details.



<p>You also see an error in <em>/var/log/netqd.log</em> similar to this:</p>

<p>To resolve the failure, remove the access_key and secret_key from the CLI configuration.</p>

<td><p>CLI: When the NetQ Collector is configured with a proxy server for the CLI to access cloud APIs the SSL certificate validation fails because the proxy provides its own self-signed certificate. This causes the CLI to fail with the following error:</p>

cumulus@switch:~# netq show agents
Failed to process command. Check /var/log/netqd.log for more details.


<p>You also see an error in <em>/var/log/netqd.log</em> similar to this:</p>

<p>Two options are available to work around this issue:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the NetQ Collector has Internet access, configure the CLI to point to the cloud API instance directly
   
cumulus@switch:~# netq config add cli server api.netq.cumulusnetworks.com port 443
cumulus@switch:~# netq config restart cli
   
</li>
	<li>To use the proxy server:<br/>
   1. Delete the token file. Run sudo rm /tmp/token.aes.<br/>
   2. Edit the <em>/etc/netq/netq.yml</em> file as follows. The password is entered as cleartext.
       
netq-cli:
  port: 32708
  server: &lt;cloud-appliance-IP-address&gt;
  vrf: &lt;default/mgmt&gt;
  premises: &lt;customer-premise&gt;
  username: &lt;customer-email-address&gt;
  password: &lt;password&gt;
  opid: &lt;opid-here&gt;

   3. Restart the the CLI. Run netq config restart cli.</p></li>

<td><p>Infra: Rarely, after a node is restarted, Kubernetes pods do not synchronize properly and the output of netq show opta-health shows failures. Node operation is not functionally impacted. You can safely remove the failures by running kubectl get pods | grep MatchNodeSelector | cut &#45;f1 &#45;d' ' | xargs kubectl delete pod. To work around the issue, do not label nodes using the API. Instead label nodes through local configuration using kubelet flag "--node-labels".</p></td>
