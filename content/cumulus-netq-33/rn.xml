<td><p>Admin UI: For cloud deployments, clicking the <em>Open NetQ</em> link at the bottom of the Admin UI NetQ Health page returns an error <em>default backend - 404</em> as it attempts to open the NetQ UI on the on-site NetQ Cloud Appliance or VM running the NetQ Collector software. In cloud deployments, the NetQ UI is run in the Cloud rather than locally, thus causing the error. To open the NetQ UI and view your data, enter <a href="https://netq.cumulusnetworks.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://netq.cumulusnetworks.com/</a> into the address bar of your browser.</p></td>

<td><p>Infra: Rarely, after a node is restarted, Kubernetes pods do not synchronize properly and the output of netq show opta-health shows failures. Node operation is not functionally impacted. You can safely remove the failures by running kubectl get pods | grep MatchNodeSelector | cut &#45;f1 &#45;d' ' | xargs kubectl delete pod. To work around the issue, do not label nodes using the API. Instead label nodes through local configuration using kubelet flag "--node-labels".</p></td>

<td><p>UI: Warnings might appear during the post-upgrade phase for a Cumulus Linux switch upgrade job. They are caused by services that have not yet been restored by the time the job is complete. Cumulus Networks recommend waiting five minutes, creating a network snapshot, then comparing that to the pre-upgrade snapshot. If the comparison shows no differences for the services, the warnings can be ignored. If there are differences, then troubleshooting the relevant service(s) is recommended.</p></td>
