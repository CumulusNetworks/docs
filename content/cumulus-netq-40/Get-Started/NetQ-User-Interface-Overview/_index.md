The NetQ graphical user interface (UI) enables you to access NetQ capabilities through a web browser as opposed to through a terminal window using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Visual representations of the health of the network, inventory, and system events make it easy to both find faults and misconfigurations, and to fix them.

You can access the UI from both on-premises and cloud deployments. Supported browsers include Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. You can use other popular browsers, NVIDIA has not tested them and they might have some presentation issues.
