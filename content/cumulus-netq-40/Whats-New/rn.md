They are caused by services that have not yet been restored by the time the job is complete. Cumulus Networks recommend waiting five minutes, creating a network snapshot, then comparing that to the pre-upgrade snapshot. If the comparison shows no differences for the services, the warnings can be ignored. If there are differences, then troubleshooting the relevant service(s) is recommended. | 3.0.0-3.3.1, 4.0.0 | |

However, the workbench might refresh before the deleted snapshotâ€™s card is removed. During the refresh, you may notice a brief flashing. This is expected behavior and you can safely ignore the flashing. |  | |
