The Docker registry container comes up without error but is not reachable on the host network. The issue occurs on cluster setups when you reboot the NetQ 4.0.0 telemetry server before upgrading<br />The netq-admin-app logs return an error message similar to the following:<pre> kubectl logs -l app=netq-app-admin --tail 1000Get http://localhost:5000/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)</pre>Since the Docker registry is not reachable, any Docker push command to it  times out. You can test this with the following command :<pre>sudo docker push localhost:5000/master-operator:4.0.0</pre>To work around this issue, restart the Docker registry container:<pre>kubectl get pods -n kube-system  \| grep docker-registry  \| cut -f1 -d' ' \| xargs kubectl delete pod -n kube-system</pre>Then restart the NetQ upgrade. | 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |

They are caused by services that have not yet been restored by the time the job is complete. Cumulus Networks recommend waiting five minutes, creating a network snapshot, then comparing that to the pre-upgrade snapshot. If the comparison shows no differences for the services, the warnings can be ignored. If there are differences, then troubleshooting the relevant service(s) is recommended. | 3.0.0-3.3.1, 4.0.0-4.0.1 | |

However, the workbench might refresh before the deleted snapshot’s card is removed. During the refresh, you may notice a brief flashing. This is expected behavior and you can safely ignore the flashing. |  | |
