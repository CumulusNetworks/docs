<td>When RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) data collection is enabled in Cumulus Linux 4.3.z and 4.4.z, you can experience high dual uplink convergence times.
To work around this issue, disable RoCE monitoring:

1. Edit &apos;/etc/netq/commands/cl4-netq-commands.yml&apos; and comment out the following lines:
        #- period: "60"
        #  key: "roce"
        #  isactive: true
        #  command: "/usr/lib/cumulus/mlxcmd --json roce counters"
        #  parser: "local"

2. Delete the &apos;/var/run/netq/netq_commands.yml&apos; file:
        $ sudo rm /var/run/netq/netq_commands.yml

3. Restart the NetQ agent:
       $ netq config agent restart</td>

<td>NetQ UI: Warnings might appear during the post-upgrade phase for a Cumulus Linux switch upgrade job. They are caused by services that have not yet been restored by the time the job is complete. Cumulus Networks recommend waiting five minutes, creating a network snapshot, then comparing that to the pre-upgrade snapshot. If the comparison shows no differences for the services, the warnings can be ignored. If there are differences, then troubleshooting the relevant service(s) is recommended.</td>
