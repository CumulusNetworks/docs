The NetQ graphical user interface (UI) enables you to access NetQ capabilities through a web browser as opposed to through a terminal window using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Visual representations of the health of the network, inventory, and system events make it easy to both find faults and misconfigurations, and to fix them.

The NetQ UI is supported on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. It is designed to be viewed on a display with a minimum resolution of 1920 Ã— 1080 pixels.
