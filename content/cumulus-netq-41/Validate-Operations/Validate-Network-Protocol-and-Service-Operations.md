NetQ lets you validate the operation of the network protocols and services running in your network either on demand or on a scheduled basis. NetQ provides three NetQ UI card workflows and several NetQ CLI validation commands to accomplish these checks on protocol and service operations:

- Validate Network card
    - Create a new on-demand or scheduled validation request or run a scheduled validation on demand
    - View a preview of all scheduled validations
- On-demand Validation Result card
    - View the number of devices and sessions tested and their status
    - View job configuration
- Scheduled Validation Result card
    - View the number and status of runs, filter by failures, paths, and warnings
    - View job configuration
- `netq check` command
    - Create and run an on-demand validation
    - View summary results, individual test status, and protocol or service specific info in the terminal window
- `netq add validation` command
    - Create an on-demand or scheduled validation
    - View results inline

For a more general understanding of how well your network is operating, refer to the {{<link title="Validate Overall Network Health">}} topic.

## On-demand Validations
<!-- vale on -->

When you want to validate the operation of one or more network protocols and services right now, you can create and run on-demand validations using the NetQ UI or the NetQ CLI.

<!-- vale off -->
### Create an On-demand Validation
<!-- vale on -->

You can create on-demand validations that contain checks for protocols or services that you suspect might have issues.

Using the NetQ UI, you can create an on-demand validation for multiple protocols or services at the same time. This is handy when the protocols are strongly related regarding a possible issue or if you only want to create one validation request.

{{<tabs "On-demand Validation">}}

{{<tab "Validate Network">}}

To create and run a request containing checks on one or more protocols or services within the NetQ UI:

1. Open the Validate Network card.

   Click {{<img src="/images/netq/validation-icon.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (**Validation**), then click **Create a validation**. Choose whether the on-demand validation should run on all devices or on specific {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#validate-device-groups" text="device groups.">}}

2. On the left side of the card, select the protocols or services you want to validate by clicking on their names, then click **Next**.

   This example shows BGP.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-4.0.0.png" width="600">}}

3. Specify which workbench you want to run the check on. To run the check in the past, click **Past** and choose the time from when you want the check to start.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-schedule-4.0.0.png" width="400">}}

4. Click **Run** to start the check.

   The associated On-demand Validation Result card opens on your workbench. If you selected more than one protocol or service, a card opens for each selection. Refer to {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#view-on-demand-validation-results" text="View On-demand Validation Results">}}.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-result-4.0.0.png" width="600">}}

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "netq check">}}

To create and run a request containing checks on a single protocol or service all within the NetQ CLI, run the relevant `netq check` command:

```

```

All `netq check` commands have a summary and test results section. Some have additional summary information.

This example shows a validation of the EVPN protocol.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check evpn
evpn check result summary:

Total nodes         : 6

```

{{%notice note%}}
Validations that support the `streaming` keyword can query real time streaming information to return results faster compared to traditional on-demand checks. The following netq checks support a streaming query:

- netq check agents
- netq check bgp
- netq check interfaces
- netq check mlag
- netq check mtu
- netq check ntp
- netq check evpn
- netq check vxlan
{{%/notice%}}

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "netq add validation">}}

To create a request containing checks on a single protocol or service in the NetQ CLI, run:

```
netq add validation type (bgp | evpn | interfaces | mlag | mtu | ntp | ospf | sensors | vlan | vxlan) [alert-on-failure]
```

This example shows the creation of an on-demand BGP validation.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq add validation type bgp
Running job 7958faef-29e0-432f-8d1e-08a0bb270c91 type bgp
```

The associated Validation Result card is accessible from the full-screen Validate Network card. Refer to {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#view-on-demand-validation-results" text="View On-demand Validation Results">}}.

{{</tab>}}

{{</tabs>}}

<!-- vale off -->
### Create an On-demand Validation with Selected Tests
<!-- vale on -->

You can include or exclude one or more of the various checks performed during a validation. Refer to {{<link title="Validation Checks">}} for a description of the tests for each protocol or service.

{{<tabs "Selected Tests">}}

{{<tab "NetQ UI">}}

To create and run a request containing checks on one or more protocols or services within the NetQ UI:

1. Open the Validate Network card.

   Click {{<img src="/images/netq/validation-icon.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (**Validation**), then click **Create a validation**.

2. On the left side of the card, select the protocols or services you want to validate by clicking on their names. For each protocol or service, select or deselect the tests you want to include or exclude.

   This example shows BGP.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-select-bgp-check-4.0.0.png" width="700">}}

   After you've made your selection, click **Next**.

3. Specify which workbench you want to run the check on. To run the check in the past, click **Past** and choose the time from when you want the check to start.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-schedule-4.0.0.png" width="400">}}

4. Click **Run** to start the check.

   The associated On-demand Validation Result card opens on your workbench. If you selected more than one protocol or service, a card opens for each selection. Refer to {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#view-on-demand-validation-results" text="View On-demand Validation Results">}}.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/on-demand-validation-result-select-bgp-4.0.0.png" width="600">}}

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "netq check">}}

Using the `include <bgp-number-range-list>` and `exclude <bgp-number-range-list>` options of the `netq check` command, you can include or exclude one or more of the various checks performed during the validation.

First determine the number of the tests you want to include or exclude. Refer to {{<link title="Validation Checks">}} for a description of these tests and to get the test numbers for the tests to include or exclude. You can also get the test numbers and descriptions when you run the `netq show unit-tests` command.

Then run the `netq check` command.

The following example shows a BGP validation that includes only the session establishment and router ID tests. Note that you can obtain the same results using either of the `include` or `exclude` options and that the test that is not run is marked as *skipped*.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq show unit-tests bgp
   0 : Session Establishment     - check if BGP session is in established state
   1 : Address Families          - check if tx and rx address family advertisement is consistent between peers of a BGP session
   2 : Router ID                 - check for BGP router id conflict in the network

Configured global result filters:
Configured per test result filters:
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp include 0,2
bgp check result summary:

Total nodes         : 10
Checked nodes       : 10
Failed nodes        : 0
Rotten nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:

Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed
Address Families Test        : skipped
Router ID Test               : passed
```

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp exclude 1
bgp check result summary:

Total nodes         : 10
Checked nodes       : 10
Failed nodes        : 0
Rotten nodes        : 0

Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed
Address Families Test        : skipped
Router ID Test               : passed
```

{{</tab>}}

{{</tabs>}}

### Run an Existing Scheduled Validation On Demand

Sometimes you have a validation scheduled to run at a later time, but you need to run it now.

To run a scheduled validation now:

1. Open the Validate Network card.

   Click {{<img src="/images/netq/validation-icon.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (**Validation**), then click **Run an existing validation**.

2. Select one or more validations you want to run by clicking their names, then click **View**.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-select-existing-4.0.0.png" width="420">}}

3. The associated Validation Result cards open on your workbench. Refer to {{<link url="#view-on-demand-validation-results" text="View On-demand Validation Results">}}.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/valid-request-medium-default-bgp-evpn-running-4.0.0.png" width="400">}}

### View On-demand Validation Results

After you have started an on-demand validation, the results are displayed based on how you created the validation request.

{{<tabs "View Validations">}}

{{<tab "Validate Network card">}}

The On-demand Validation Result card workflow enables you to view the results of on-demand validation requests. When a request has started processing, the associated large Validation Result card is displayed on your workbench with an indicator that it is running. When multiple network protocols or services are included in a validation, a validation result card is opened for each protocol and service. After an on-demand validation request has completed, the results are available in the same Validation Result cards.

{{<notice tip>}}
It might take a few minutes for results to appear if the load on the NetQ system is heavy at the time of the run.
{{</notice>}}

To view the results:

1. Locate the large On-demand Validation Result card on your workbench for the protocol or service check that was run.  

    You can identify it by the on-demand result icon, <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/35-Health-Beauty/07-Monitoring/monitor-heart-beat-search.svg" height="18" width="18"/>, protocol or service name, and the date and time that it was run.  

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-result-4.0.0.png" width="600">}}

   {{%notice note%}}

You can have more than one card open for a given protocol or service, so be sure to use the date and time on the card to ensure you are viewing the correct card.  

   {{%/notice%}}

2. Note the total number and distribution of results for the tested devices and sessions (when appropriate). Are there many failures?

3. Hover over the charts to view the total number of warnings or failures and what percentage of the total results that represents for both devices and sessions.

4. To get more information about the errors reported, hover over the right side of the test and click **More Details**.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validation-result-error-details-bgp-4.0.0.png" width="700">}}

5. To view all data available for all on-demand validation results for a given protocol, click **Show All Results** to switch to the full screen card.

Comparing various results can give you a clue as to why certain devices are experiencing more warnings or failures. For example, more failures occurred between certain times or on a particular device.

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "netq check">}}

The results of the `netq check` command are displayed in the terminal window where you ran the command. See {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#on-demand-cli-validation-examples" text="On-demand CLI Validation Examples">}} below.

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "netq add validation">}}

The results of the `netq add validation` command are displayed in the terminal window where you ran the command. See {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#on-demand-cli-validation-examples" text="On-demand CLI Validation Examples">}} below.

#### On-Demand CLI Validation Examples

This section provides CLI validation examples for a variety of protocols and elements.

{{%notice note%}}
Validations that support the `streaming` keyword can query real time streaming information to return results faster compared to traditional on-demand checks. The following netq checks support a streaming query:

- netq check agents
- netq check bgp
- netq check interfaces
- netq check mlag
- netq check mtu
- netq check ntp
- netq check evpn
- netq check vxlan
{{%/notice%}}


{{<tabs "CLI Examples">}}

{{<tab "Addresses">}}

The duplicate address detection validation tests look for duplicate IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to interfaces across devices in the inventory, and check for duplicate /32 host routes in each VRF.

```
cumulus@switch:mgmt:~$ netq check addresses
addr check result summary:

Total nodes         : 25
Checked nodes       : 25
Failed nodes        : 0
Rotten nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0
Skipped Nodes       : 0


IPV4 Duplicate Address Test   : passed
IPV6 Duplicate Address Test   : passed

```

Refer to {{<link url="Validation-Checks/#netq-agent-validation-tests" text="NetQ Agent Validation Tests">}} for descriptions of these tests.

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "Agent">}}

The default validation confirms that the NetQ Agent is running on all monitored nodes and provides a summary of the validation results. This example shows the results of a fully successful validation.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check agents streaming
agent check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 13
Total nodes         : 13
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Agent Health Test   : passed
```

Refer to {{<link url="Validation-Checks/#netq-agent-validation-tests" text="NetQ Agent Validation Tests">}} for descriptions of these tests.

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "BGP">}}

The default validation runs a networkwide BGP connectivity and configuration check on all nodes running the BGP service:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp streaming
bgp check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 8
Total nodes         : 8
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Total Sessions      : 30
Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed
Address Families Test        : passed
Router ID Test               : passed

```

This example indicates that all nodes running BGP and all BGP sessions are running properly. If there were issues with any of the nodes, NetQ would provide information about each node to aid in resolving the issues.

### Perform a BGP Validation for a Particular VRF

Using the `vrf <vrf>` option of the `netq check bgp` command, you can validate the BGP service where communication is occurring through a particular virtual route. In this example, the name of the VRF of interest is *vrf1*.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp vrf vrf1
bgp check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 2
Total nodes         : 2
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Total Sessions      : 2
Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed
Address Families Test        : passed
Router ID Test               : passed
```

### Perform a BGP Validation with Selected Tests

Using the `include <bgp-number-range-list>` and `exclude <bgp-number-range-list>` options, you can include or exclude one or more of the various checks performed during the validation. You can select from the following BGP validation tests:

| Test Number | Test Name |
| :---------: | --------- |
| 0 | Session Establishment |
| 1 | Address Families |
| 2 | Router ID |

Refer to {{<link url="Validation-Checks#bgp-validation-tests" text="BGP Validation Tests">}} for a description of these tests.

To include only the session establishment and router ID tests during a validation, run either of these commands:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp include 0,2

cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp exclude 1
```

Either way, a successful validation output should be similar to the following:

```
bgp check result summary:

Checked nodes       : 8
Total nodes         : 8
Rotten nodes        : 0
Failed nodes        : 0
Warning nodes       : 0

Additional summary:
Total Sessions      : 30
Failed Sessions     : 0

Session Establishment Test   : passed,
Address Families Test        : skipped
Router ID Test               : passed,
```

### Perform a BGP Validation and Output Results to JSON File

This example shows the default BGP validation results as it appears in a JSON file.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq check bgp json

## Scheduled Validations

When you want to see validation results on a regular basis, it is useful to configure a scheduled validation request to avoid re-creating the request each time. You can create up to 15 scheduled validations for a given NetQ system.

{{%notice note%}}

By default, a scheduled validation for each protocol and service runs every hour. You do not need to create a scheduled validation for these unless you want it to run at a different interval. You cannot remove the default validations, but they do not count as part of the 15-validation limit.

{{%/notice%}}

### Create a Scheduled Validation

You can create scheduled validations using the NetQ UI and the NetQ CLI.

You might want to create a scheduled validation that runs more often than the default validation if you are investigating an issue with a protocol or service. You might also want to create a scheduled validation that runs less often than the default validation if you prefer a longer term performance trend. Use the following instructions based on how you want to create the validation.

Sometimes it is useful to run validations on more than one protocol simultaneously. This gives a view into any potential relationship between the protocols or services status. For example, you might want to compare NTP with Agent validations if NetQ Agents are losing connectivity or the data <!-- vale off -->appears to be collected<!-- vale on --> at the wrong time. It would help determine if loss of time synchronization is causing the issue. You create simultaneous validations using the NetQ UI only.

{{<tabs "New Scheduled Validation">}}

{{<tab "Validation Request">}}

1. Open the Validate Network card.

   Click {{<img src="/images/netq/validation-icon.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (**Validation**), then click **Create a validation**. Choose whether the scheduled validation should run on all devices or on specific {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#validate-device-groups" text="device groups.">}}

2. On the left side of the card, select the protocols or services you want to validate by clicking on their names, then click **Next**.

3. Select whether you want to run the check now or later, and on which workbench.

   To run the check now, select how frequently it repeats and on which workbench to run the check.

   To run the check later, click **Later** then choose when to start the check, how frequently to repeat the check (every 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, or 1 day), and on which workbench to run the check.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-schedule-4.0.0.png" width="400">}}

4. Click **Schedule** to schedule the check.

   To see the card with the other network validations, click **View**. If you selected more than one protocol or service, a card opens for each selection.
   
   {{<figure src="/images/netq/validate-network-view-bgp-check-4.0.0.png" width="200">}}

   To view the card on your workbench, click **Open card**. If you selected more than one protocol or service, a card opens for each selection.

   {{<figure src="/images/netq/scheduled-validation-result-bgp-4.0.0.png" width="200">}}

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "netq add validation">}}

To create a scheduled request containing checks on a single protocol or service in the NetQ CLI, run:

```
netq add validation name <text-new-validation-name> type (agents | bgp | evpn | interfaces | mlag | mtu | ntp | ospf | sensors | vlan | vxlan) interval <text-time-min>
```

This example shows the creation of a BGP validation run every 15 minutes for debugging.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq add validation name Bgp15m type bgp interval 15m
Successfully added Bgp15m running every 15m
```

The associated Validation Result card is accessible from the full-screen Scheduled Validation Result card. Refer to {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#view-scheduled-validation-results" text="View Scheduled Validation Results">}}.

You might want to remove this validation after you complete your analysis. Refer to {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#delete-a-scheduled-validation" text="Delete a Scheduled Validation">}}.

{{</tab>}}

{{</tabs>}}

### View Scheduled Validation Results

After creating scheduled validations with either the NetQ UI or the NetQ CLI, the results appear in the Scheduled Validation Result card. When a request has completed processing, you can access the Validation Result card from the full-screen Validations card. Each protocol and service has its own validation result card, but the content is similar on each.

#### Granularity of Data Shown Based on Time Period

On the medium and large Validation Result cards, vertically stacked heat maps represent the status of the runs; one for passing runs, one for runs with warnings, and one for runs with failures. Depending on the time period of data on the card, the number of smaller time blocks indicate that the status varies. A vertical stack of time blocks, one from each map, includes the results from all checks during that time. The results appear by how saturated the color is for each block. If all validations during that time period pass, then the middle block is 100% saturated (white) and the warning and failure blocks are zero % saturated (gray). As warnings and errors increase in saturation, the passing block is proportionally reduced in saturation. The example heat map for a time period of 24 hours shown here uses the most common time periods from the table showing the resulting time blocks and regions.

{{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-granularity-230.png" width="300">}}

| Time Period | Number of Runs | Number Time Blocks | Amount of Time in Each Block |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |

#### Access and Analyze the Scheduled Validation Results

Once a scheduled validation request has completed, the results are available in the corresponding Validation Result card.

To access the results:

1. Open the Validate Network card.

   Click {{<img src="/images/netq/validation-icon.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (**Validation**), then click **Open an existing validation**.

2. Select the validation results you want to view, then click **View results**.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/validations-picker-4.0.0.png" width="500">}}

3. The medium Scheduled Validation Result card(s) for the selected items open.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-medium-222.png" width="425">}}

To analyze the results:

1. Note the distribution of results. Are there many failures? Are they concentrated together in time? Has the protocol or service recovered after the failures?

2. Hover over the heat maps to view the status numbers and what percentage of the total results that represents for a given region. The tooltip also shows the number of devices included in the validation and the number with warnings and/or failures. This is useful when you see the failures occurring on a small set of devices, as it might point to an issue with the devices rather than the network service.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-medium-bgp-popup-222.png" width="200">}}

3. Optionally, click **Open** \<*network service*\> **Card** link to open the medium individual Network Services card. Your current card does not close.

4. Switch to the large Scheduled Validation card using the card size picker.

5. Click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/53-Resize/expand-horizontal-3.svg" height="18" width="18">}} to expand the chart.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-large-bgp-expand-chart-230.png" width="500">}}

6. Collapse the heat map by clicking {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/53-Resize/expand-horizontal-3.svg" height="18" width="18">}}.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-large-bgp-collapse-chart-230.png" width="500">}}

7. If there are a large number of warnings or failures, view the devices with the most issues by clicking **Most Active** in the filter above the table. This might help narrow the failures down to a particular device or small set of devices that you can investigate further.

8. Select the **Most Recent** filter above the table to see the events that have occurred in the near past at the top of the list.

9. Optionally, view the health of the protocol or service as a whole by clicking **Open** \<*network service*\> **Card** (when available).

10. You can view the configuration of the request that produced the results shown on this card workflow, by hovering over the card and clicking {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/12-Settings/cog-1.svg" height="18" width="18">}}. If you want to change the configuration, click **Edit Config** to open the large Validate Network card, pre-populated with the current configuration. Follow the instructions in {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#modify-a-scheduled-validation" text="Modify a Scheduled Validation">}} to make your changes.

11. To view all data available for all scheduled validation results for the given protocol or service, click **Show All Results** or switch to the full screen card.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-result-fullscr-bgp-241.png" width="700">}}

12. Look for changes and patterns in the results. Scroll to the right. Are there more failed sessions or nodes during one or more validations?

13. Double-click in a given result row to open details about the validation.

    From this view you can:
    - See a summary of the validation results by clicking {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/52-Arrows-Diagrams/01-Arrows/arrow-button-right-2.svg" width="14" height="14">}} in the banner under the title. Toggle the arrow to close the summary.

        {{<figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-details-summary-fullscr.png" width="300">}}

    - See detailed results of each test run to validate the protocol or service. When errors or warnings are present, the nodes and relevant detail is provided.

        {{<figure src="/images/netq/od-valid-result-bgp-tests-fullscr.png" width="700">}}

    - Export the data by clicking **Export**.

    - Return to the validation jobs list by clicking {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/close.svg" width="14" height="14">}}.

    Comparing various results can give you a clue as to why certain devices are experiencing more warnings or failures. For  example, more failures occurred between certain times or on a particular device.

### Manage Scheduled Validations

You can modify any scheduled validation that you created or remove it altogether at any time. Default validations cannot be removed or modified, but {{<link title="Validation Checks#disabling-validation-checks" text="can be disabled.">}}

#### Modify a Scheduled Validation

At some point you might want to change the schedule or validation types that are specified in a scheduled validation request. This creates a new validation request and the original validation has the *(old)* label applied to the name. The old validation can no longer be edited.

{{%notice info%}}

When you update a scheduled request, the results for all future runs of the validation will be different than the results of previous runs of the validation.

{{%/notice%}}

To modify a scheduled validation:

1. Open the Validate Network card.

    Click {{<img src="/images/netq/validation-icon.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (**Validation**), then click **Show all scheduled validations**.

2. Hover over the validation then click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/22-Edit/pencil-1.svg" height="18" width="18"/> to edit it.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/validations-edit-4.0.0.png" width="250">}}

3. Select which checks to add or remove from the validation request.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/validations-edit-select-4.0.0.png" width="700">}}

4. Click **Update**.

5. Change the schedule for the validation, then click **Update**.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/validations-edit-schedule-4.0.0.png" width="500">}}

    The validation can now be selected from the Validation list (on the small, medium or large size card) and run immediately using **Open an existing validation**, or you can wait for it to run the first time according to the schedule you specified. Refer to {{<link title="Validate Network Protocol and Service Operations#view-scheduled-validation-results" text="View Scheduled Validation Results">}}.

#### Delete a Scheduled Validation

You can remove a user-defined scheduled validation at any time using the NetQ UI or the NetQ CLI. Default validations cannot be removed.

{{<tabs "Delete Scheduled Validation">}}

{{<tab "NetQ UI">}}

1. Open the Validate Network card.

    Click {{<img src="/images/netq/validation-icon.svg" height="18" width="18">}} (**Validation**), then click **Show all scheduled validations**.

2. Hover over the validation you want to remove.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/sch-valid-remove-4.0.0.png" width="700">}}

3. Click {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/23-Delete/bin-1.svg" height="18" width="18">}}, then click **Yes** to confirm.

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "NetQ CLI">}}

1. Determine the name of the scheduled validation you want to remove. Run:

    ```
    netq show validation summary [name <text-validation-name>] type (agents | bgp | evpn | interfaces | mlag | mtu | ntp | ospf | sensors | vlan | vxlan) [around <text-time-hr>] [json]
    ```

    This example shows all scheduled validations for BGP.

    ```
    cumulus@switch:~$ netq show validation summary type bgp
    Name            Type             Job ID       Checked Nodes              Failed Nodes             Total Nodes            Timestamp

    ```

2. Remove the validation. Run:

    ```
    netq del validation <text-validation-name>
    ```

    This example removes the scheduled validation named *Bgp15m*.

    ```
    cumulus@switch:~$ netq del validation Bgp15m
    Successfully deleted validation Bgp15m
    ```

3. Repeat these steps for additional scheduled validations you want to remove.
