This page describes how to upgrade your NetQ virtual machines. Note that the upgrade instructions vary depending on NetQ version youâ€™re currently running.

For deployments running:

- 4.9.0, 4.8.0, 4.7.0, 4.6.0, or 4.5.0: upgrade directly to NetQ 4.10.0 by following the steps on this page
- 4.4.1, 4.4.0, or 4.3.0: {{<link title="Back Up and Restore NetQ" text="back up your NetQ data">}} and perform a {{<link title="Install the NetQ System" text="new installation">}}
- 4.2.0 or earlier: upgrade incrementally {{<exlink url="https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-netq-43/Installation-Management/Upgrade-NetQ/Upgrade-System/" text="to version 4.3.0">}}. Then {{<link title="Back Up and Restore NetQ" text="back up your NetQ data">}} and perform a {{<link title="Install the NetQ System" text="new installation">}}

During the upgrade process, NetQ will be temporarily unavailable.
## Before You Upgrade

1. Verify that Kubernetes is running and the admin app is up:

```
cumulus@masternode:~$ /home/cumulus# kubectl get pods|grep admin
    netq-app-admin-masternode                            1/1     Running            0               15m
```

If the output of this command displays errors or returns an empty response, you will not be able to upgrade NetQ. Try waiting and then re-run the command. If after several attempts the command continues to fail, reset the NetQ server with `netq bootstrap reset keep-db` and perform a fresh installation of the tarball with the appropriate {{<link title="install" text="netq install">}} command for your deployment type.

2. {{<link title="Back Up and Restore NetQ" text="Back up your NetQ data">}}. This is an optional step for on-premises deployments. NVIDIA automatically creates backups for NetQ cloud deployments.

## Update NetQ Debian Packages

1. Update `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cumulus-netq.list` to netq-4.10:

    ```
    cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cumulus-netq.list
    deb [arch=amd64] https://apps3.cumulusnetworks.com/repos/deb focal netq-4.10
    ```

2. Update the NetQ `debian` packages. In cluster deployments, update the packages on the master and all worker nodes:

    ```
    cumulus@<hostname>:~$ sudo apt-get update
    Get:1 https://apps3.cumulusnetworks.com/repos/deb focal InRelease [13.8 kB]
    Get:2 https://apps3.cumulusnetworks.com/repos/deb focal/netq-4.10 amd64 Packages [758 B]
    Hit:3 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal InRelease
    Get:4 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security InRelease [88.7 kB]
    Get:5 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-updates InRelease [88.7 kB]

## Download the Upgrade Software

1. Download the upgrade tarball.

    {{<netq-install/upgrade-image version="4.10">}}

2. Copy the tarball to the `/mnt/installables/` directory on your NetQ VM.

## Run the Upgrade

{{%notice note%}}

Perform the following steps using the `cumulus` user account.

### Pre-installation Checks

Verify the following items before upgrading NetQ.

1. Confirm your VM is configured with 16 vCPUs. If your VM is configured with fewer than 16 vCPUs, power off your VM, reconfigure your hypervisor to allocate 16 vCPUs, then power the VM on before proceeding. For cluster deployments, verify these requirements on each node in the cluster.

2. Check if there is sufficient disk space:

```
cumulus@<hostname>:~$ df -h /
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       248G   70G  179G  28% /
cumulus@netq-appliance:~$
```
NVIDIA recommends proceeding with the installation only if the `Use%` is less than 70%. You can delete previous software tarballs in the `/mnt/installables/` directory to regain some space. If you cannot decrease disk usage to under 70%, contact the NVIDIA support team.

3. Confirm that the NetQ CLI is {{<link url="Install-NetQ-CLI/#configure-the-netq-cli" text="properly configured">}}. The `netq show agents` command should complete successfully and display agent status.

4. Ensure that the necessary ports are open {{<link title="Install the NetQ System" text="according to your deployment model">}}.

{{%notice note%}}

If you are upgrading a cluster deployment from NetQ v4.8.0 or earlier, you must open TCP port 36443 for Kubernetes control plane operations.

### Upgrade Using the NetQ CLI

1. Run the appropriate commands for your deployment type:

{{<tabs "tabID142">}}

{{<tab "On-premises Deployments">}}

{{<tabs "On-prem standalone or cluster">}}

{{<tab "Standalone">}}

```
cumulus@<hostname>:~$ netq upgrade bundle /mnt/installables/NetQ-4.10.0.tgz
```

{{%notice info%}}
If this step fails for any reason, run the <code>netq bootstrap reset keep-db</code> command and perform a fresh installation of the tarball with the {{<link title="install/#netq-install-standalone-full" text="netq install standalone full">}} command.
{{%/notice%}}
{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "Cluster">}}

Run the `netq upgrade` command, specifying the current version's tarball and your cluster's virtual IP address. The virtual IP address must be allocated from the same subnet used for your master and worker nodes.

```
cumulus@<hostname>:~$ netq upgrade bundle /mnt/installables/NetQ-4.10.0.tgz cluster-vip <vip-ip>
```
{{%notice note%}}

If you are upgrading from a NetQ 4.9 or 4.8 high availability, on-premises cluster with a virtual IP address, you do not need to include the `cluster-vip` option in the upgrade command. Specifying a virtual IP address that is different from the virtual IP address used during the installation process will cause the upgrade to fail. 

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice info%}}
If this step fails for any reason, run the <code>netq bootstrap reset keep-db</code> command and perform a fresh installation of the tarball with the {{<link title="install/#netq-install-cluster-full" text="netq install cluster full">}} command.
{{%/notice%}}
{{</tab>}}

{{</tabs>}}

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "Cloud Deployments">}}

{{<tabs "Cloud standalone or cluster">}}

{{<tab "Standalone">}}

```
cumulus@<hostname>:~$ netq upgrade bundle /mnt/installables/NetQ-4.10.0-opta.tgz
```
{{%notice info%}}
If this step fails for any reason, run the <code>netq bootstrap reset keep-db</code> command and perform a fresh installation of the tarball with the {{<link title="install/#netq-install-opta-standalone-full" text="netq install opta standalone full">}} command.
{{%/notice%}}

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab "Cluster">}}

Run the `netq upgrade` command, specifying the current version's tarball and your cluster's virtual IP address. The virtual IP address must be allocated from the same subnet used for your master and worker nodes.

```
cumulus@<hostname>:~$ netq upgrade bundle /mnt/installables/NetQ-4.10.0-opta.tgz cluster-vip <vip-ip>
```
{{%notice note%}}

If you are upgrading from a NetQ 4.9 or 4.8 high availability, cloud cluster with a virtual IP address, you do not need to include the `cluster-vip` option in the upgrade command. Specifying a virtual IP address that is different from the virtual IP address used during the installation process will cause the upgrade to fail. 

{{%/notice%}}
{{%notice info%}}
If this step fails for any reason, run the <code>netq bootstrap reset keep-db</code> command and perform a fresh installation of the tarball with the {{<link title="install/#netq-install-opta-cluster-full" text="netq install opta cluster full">}} command.

2. Confirm the upgrade was successful:

{{<tabs "TabID230" >}}

{{<tab "On-premises VM" >}}

    ```
    cumulus@<hostname>:~$ cat /etc/app-release
    BOOTSTRAP_VERSION=4.9.0
    APPLIANCE_MANIFEST_HASH=a9d82e8df46178c9a0b3ac17678d4ae8aeba54a89c502fc8042de1f784fc3ef2
