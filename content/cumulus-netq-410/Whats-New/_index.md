This page summarizes new features and improvements for the NetQ {{<version>}} release. For a complete list of open and fixed issues, see the {{<link title="NVIDIA NetQ 4.10 Release Notes" text="release notes">}}.

## What's New in NetQ 4.10.1

NetQ 4.10.1 provides all the same new features and enhancements as NetQ 4.10.0, and in addition, supports {{<link title="Upgrade Cumulus Linux" text="NetQ Lifecycle Management">}} switch upgrades to Cumulus Linux 5.9 for switches configured with NVUE. 

## What's New in NetQ 4.10.0

NetQ 4.10 integrates with Base Command Manager (BCM), a toolkit to streamline cluster provisioning, workload management, and infrastructure monitoring. With Base Command Manager and NetQ, administrators can monitor telemetry data and perform health checks on a networkâ€™s fabric.

Base Command Manager 10 also provides a Kubernetes wizard to manage NetQ provisioning for high availability, on-prem single or multi-node clusters. Using the wizard, administrators can:

- Avoid port conflicts between BCM and NetQ
- Verify that all the installation prerequisites are met
- Choose between single-node or high-availability deployments
- Configure files and directories in exclude lists
- Synchronize clocks
- Deploy the NetQ server
- Connect the cluster management daemon, CMDaemon, to the NetQ server to pull telemetry data

To get started, refer to the {{<exlink url="https://docs.nvidia.com/base-command-manager/#product-manuals" text="Base Command Manager administrator and containerization manuals">}}.
