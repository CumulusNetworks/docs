This section describes how to upgrade from your current installation to NetQ {{<version>}}. Refer to the {{<link title="NVIDIA NetQ 4.11 Release Notes" text="release notes">}} before you upgrade.

You must upgrade your NetQ on-premises or cloud virtual machines. Upgrading NetQ Agents is optional, but recommended. If you want access to new and updated commands, you can upgrade the CLI on your physical servers or VMs, and monitored switches and hosts as well.

Follow these steps to upgrade your on-premises or cloud deployment. Note that these steps are sequential; **you must upgrade your NetQ virtual machine before you upgrade the NetQ Agents.**
