NVIDIA® NetQ™ is a network operations tool set that provides visibility into your overlay and underlay networks, enabling troubleshooting in real-time. NetQ delivers data and statistics about the health of your data center—from the container, virtual machine, or host, all the way to the switch and port. NetQ correlates configuration and operational status, and tracks state changes while simplifying management for the entire Linux-based data center. With NetQ, network operations change from a manual, reactive, node-by-node approach to an automated, informed, and agile one. Visit {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/netq/" text="Network Operations with NetQ">}} to learn more.

This user guide provides documentation for network administrators who are responsible for deploying, configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting the network in their data center or campus environment.
