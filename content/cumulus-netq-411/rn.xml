<td>When you use NetQ LCM to upgrade a Cumulus Linux switch from version 5.9 to 5.10, and if the upgrade fails, NetQ rolls back to version 5.9 and reverts the {{cumulus}} user password to the default password. After rollback, reconfigure the password with the {{nv set system aaa user cumulus password &lt;password&gt;}} command.  </td>

<td>When you use NetQ LCM to upgrade a Cumulus Linux switch with NTP configured using NVUE in a VRF that is not {{mgmt}}, the upgrade fails to complete. To work around this issue, first unset the NTP configuration with the {{nv unset service ntp}} and {{nv config apply}} commands, and reconfigure NTP after the upgrade completes.</td>

To suppress this validation failure, run the {{netq add check-filter  check_filter_id addr_1 check_name addr test_name IPV4_Duplicate_Address scope '[{"Prefix": "127.0.1.1"}]'}} CLI command, or use the NetQ UI to add duplicate address filter for address 127.0.1.1. </td>

<td>When you upgrade a Cumulus Linux switch configured with NVUE using NetQ LCM, the upgrade might fail due to NVUE configuration validation if the NVUE object model was changed between the current and new Cumulus Linux version.
