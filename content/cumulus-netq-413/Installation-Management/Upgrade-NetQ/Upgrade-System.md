Upgrading to NetQ 4.13.0 from a previous NetQ release requires a new installation of the NetQ virtual machine. You can upgrade directly to NetQ 4.13 if your deployment is running version 4.12 or 4.11.

- For on-premises deployments: {{<link title="Back Up and Restore NetQ" text="back up your NetQ data">}} and use the new data restoration workflow to install NetQ 4.13.
- For cloud deployments: perform a {{<link title="Install the NetQ System" text="fresh 4.13 installation">}}. NetQ data is backed up automatically for cloud deployments.
