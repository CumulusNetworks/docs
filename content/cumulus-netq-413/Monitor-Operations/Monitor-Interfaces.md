## View Link Interfaces

To view a table of interfaces along with types, states, and basic details, select the {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/03-Menu/navigation-menu.svg" height="18" width="18">}} **Menu**, then enter **Interfaces** in the search field.

## Compare Link Interfaces

{{%notice note%}}
Link health view is in beta for scale deployments and generally available for non-scale deployments.

To troubleshoot link issues, expand the {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/03-Menu/navigation-menu.svg" height="18" width="18">}} **Menu**, then select **Link health view**. From this dashboard you can compare links according to different parameters, such as link utilization, link flaps (when a link transitions from up to down to up), transmit and receive counters, drops and errors, and other counter data. NetQ only displays links in the 'up' state; the data is updated in real time.

To compare links, select up to 20 links from the dashboard, then click **Compare selected** above the table. The comparison charts update to reflect the data from the links you selected. Toggle the **Show top 5** switch on or off to view the top five and bottom five devices and their respective links according to the parameters you selected. In each of the charts, the x-axis represents time in hours, according to a 24-hour clock and the y-axis represents a count of the parameter you selected. The yellow line displays the average values for the selected links.

You can click each of the comparison charts anywhere along the x-axis to open a tabular view of the data that is displayed in the chart during the hour you selected.

You can bookmark the link health view in your browser. When you navigate back to the bookmarked page or share the link, your settings will be preserved.

## Interface Commands

NetQ uses {{<kb_link latest="cl" url="Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol.md" text="LLDP">}} (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) to collect port information. NetQ can also identify peer ports connected to DACs (Direct Attached Cables) and AOCs (Active Optical Cables) without using LLDP, even if the link is not UP.

- {{<link title="show/#netq-show-events" text="netq show events message_type interfaces">}}
- {{<link title="check/#netq check interfaces" text="netq check interfaces">}}

You can view link and interface statistics with the following commands:

- {{<link title="show/#netq-show-ethtool-stats" text="netq show ethtool-stats">}}
- {{<link title="show/#netq-show-interface-stats" text="netq show interface-stats">}}

- {{<link title="show/#netq-show-resource-util" text="netq show resource-util">}}

## Check for MTU Inconsistencies

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) determines the largest size packet or frame that can be transmitted across a given communication link. When the MTU is not configured to the same value on both ends of the link, communication problems can occur. Use the {{<link title="check/#netq-check-mtu" text="netq check mtu">}} command to verify that the MTU is correctly specified for each link.
