<td>When you back up your data from a prior NetQ release and restore it after installing NetQ 4.13.0, any switches that were in a rotten state are missing from the NetQ inventory after the upgrade. To work around this issue, decommission any rotten switches before you upgrade and reconnect the agents after the upgrade is complete.Additionally, no snapshot or PTP data is restored from prior releases after the upgrade. </td>

<td>When you add a new switch to the NetQ inventory, the NetQ UI might not display interface statistics or interface validation data for the new switch for up to one hour.
