<td>When you add a new switch to the NetQ inventory, the NetQ UI might not display interface statistics or interface validation data for the new switch for up to one hour.

To work around this issue, adjust the poll period to 60 seconds on the new switch with the &lt;code&gt;netq config add agent command service-key ports poll-period 60&lt;/code&gt; command. When interface data is displayed in the NetQ UI, change it back to the default value of 3600 with the &lt;code&gt;netq config add agent command service-key ports poll-period 3600&lt;/code&gt; command.
