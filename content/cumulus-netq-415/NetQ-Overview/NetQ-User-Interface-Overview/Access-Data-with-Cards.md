Cards present information about your network for monitoring and troubleshooting; each card describes a particular aspect of the network. Cards are collected onto a {{<link title="Focus Your Monitoring Using Workbenches" text="workbench">}} where all data relevant to a task or set of tasks is visible. You can add and remove cards from a workbench, increase or decrease their sizes, change the time period of the data shown on a card, and make copies of cards to show different levels of data for the same time period.

## Available Cards

Each card focuses on a particular aspect of your network. They include:

- **Validation summary**: overview of your network's health
- Events cards: system anomalies and threshold-crossing events (**Events** card), network issues and packet drops (**What Just Happened** card), and link events (**Link events** card)
- Link cards: overview of links at the fabric level (**Switch link status** card) <!--check categorization of link events card-->
- **Sensor health**: overview of fan, temperature, and PSU states
- **Queue status**: ports experiencing most packet buffer congestion
- **Device groups**: distribution of device components
- **Trace request**: discovery workflow for paths between two devices in the network fabric
- **MAC move commentary**: info about changes to a MAC address on a specific VLAN
- Network services cards: **BGP**, **MLAG**, **EVPN**, and **LLDP**
- Inventory cards: **Devices**, **Switches**, **DPUs**, **NICs**, and **Hosts**

## Card Sizes

You can increase or decrease the size of certain cards. The granularity of the content on a card varies with the size of the card, with the highest level of information on the smallest card to the most detailed information on the full-screen card.

### Change the Size of the Card

{{<tabs "134">}}

{{<tab "NetQ UI">}}

### Change the Time Period for the Card Data

{{<tabs "154">}}

{{<tab "NetQ UI">}}

All cards have a default time period for the data shown on the card, typically the last 24 hours. You can change the time period to view the data during a different time range to better understand issues and events.

To change the time period for a card:

1. Hover over the top portion of the card and select the clock <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/18-Time/time-stopwatch.svg" alt="" height="18" width="18"/>.

3. Select a time period from the dropdown menu.

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/time-dropdown-411.png" alt="" width="300">}}

{{<notice tip>}}
Changing the time period in this manner only changes the time period for the given card.

## Table Settings

You can manipulate the tabular data displayed in a full-screen card by filtering and sorting the columns. Hover over the column header and select it to sort the column. The data is sorted in ascending or descending order: A-Z, Z-A, 1-n, or n-1. The number of rows that can be sorted via the UI is limited to 10,000. To reposition the columns, drag and drop them using your mouse. 

Select <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/05-Internet-Networks-Servers/08-Upload-Download/upload-bottom.svg" alt="" height="18" width="18"/> **Export** to download and export the tabular data. You can sort and filter tables that exceed 10,000 rows by exporting the data as a CSV file and opening it in a spreadsheet program.

{{<notice tip>}}
If your browser prevents you from downloading an exported file because it is too large, you can apply filters in the UI to decrease the size of the dataset.
