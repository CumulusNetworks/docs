## What's New in NetQ 4.15

## Release Considerations

- When you upgrade to NetQ v4.15.0, any pre-existing validation data will be lost. Additionally, NetQ will not retain data related to network services (including BGP, LLDP, EVPN, and MLAG) after upgrading.
- You must upgrade cloud (OPTA) deployments to NetQ 4.15 before initiating a {{<link title="Switch Management/#switch-discovery" text="switch discovery">}}.
- The NetQ agent is not compatible with Broadcom switches. Reach out to your NVIDIA support representative if your networking environment requires Broadcom support.

### Upgrade Paths

You can upgrade to NetQ 4.15 if your deployment is running version 4.14 or 4.13. For on-premises and cloud deployments, {{<link title="Back Up and Restore NetQ" text="back up your NetQ data">}}, then concurrently restore your data and upgrade NetQ during a {{<link title="Install the NetQ System" text="new NetQ 4.15 installation">}}


### Compatible Agent Versions

The NetQ 4.15 server is compatible with NetQ agents 4.15 and 4.14. You can install NetQ agents on switches and servers running:

- Cumulus Linux 5.13.1, 5.12.1 <!--update to 5.14.0, 5.13.1 when 5.14 is released-->
