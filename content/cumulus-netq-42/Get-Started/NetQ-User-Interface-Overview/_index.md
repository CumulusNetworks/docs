The NetQ user interface (UI) lets you access NetQ through a web browser instead of a terminal window with a command line interface (CLI). With the UI, you can visualize network health, inventory, and system events, making it easy to find errors and misconfigurations, and to fix them.

The NetQ UI is supported on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. It is designed to be viewed on a display with a minimum resolution of 1920 Ã— 1080 pixels.
