3. Enter the fields and select **Save**.

    {{%notice note%}}
Be especially careful entering the email address as you *cannot* change it once you save the account. If you save a mistyped email address, you must delete the account and create a new one.

### Edit a User Account

As an admin, you can:
+ edit a user's first or last name
+ reset a user's password
+ change a user's access type (user or admin)

You cannot edit a userâ€™s email address, because this is the identifier the system uses for authentication. If you need to change an email address, delete the user and create a new one.

To edit an account:

1. On the User Accounts card, select **Manage** to open a table listing all user accounts.

2. Select the user whose account you'd like to edit. Above the table, click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/22-Edit/pencil-1.svg" alt="edit" height="18" width="18"/> to edit the user's account information.
