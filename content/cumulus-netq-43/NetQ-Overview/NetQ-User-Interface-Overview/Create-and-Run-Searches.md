The Global Search field in the UI header lets you search for devices or cards. You can create new searches or run existing searches.

## Create a Search

As with most search fields, you begin by entering the criteria in the search field. As you type, items that match the search criteria appear in the search history dropdown along with the last time the search ran. Wildcards are not allowed, but this predictive matching eliminates the need for them. By default, the most recent searches appear. Selecting a suggested search from the list provides a preview of the search results to the right.
    {{<notice note>}}
If you have more matches than fit in the window, click the <strong>See All # Results</strong> link to view all found matches. The count represents the number of devices found. It does not include cards found.

<!-- ## Run a Recent Search

You can re-run a recent search, saving time if you are comparing data from two or more devices.

To re-run a recent search:

1. Click in the **Global Search** field.

2. When the desired search appears in the suggested searches list, select it.

You might have to click <strong>See All # Results</strong> to find the desired search. If you do not find it in the list, you can still find it in the <strong>Recent Actions</strong> list.
