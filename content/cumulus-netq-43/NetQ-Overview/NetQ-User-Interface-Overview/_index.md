The NetQ user interface (UI) lets you access NetQ through a web browser instead of a terminal window with a command line interface (CLI). With the UI, you can visualize network health, inventory, and system events, making it easy to find errors and misconfigurations, and to fix them.

You can access the UI from both the on-premises and cloud deployments. NetQ supports Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Other browsers may have problems loading NetQ.
