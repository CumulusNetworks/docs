NVIDIA® NetQ™ is a highly scalable, modern network operations tool set that provides visibility and troubleshooting of your overlay and underlay networks in real-time. NetQ delivers actionable insights and operational intelligence about the health of your data center—from the container, virtual machine, or host, all the way to the switch and port. NetQ correlates configuration and operational status, and instantly identifies and tracks state changes while simplifying management for the entire Linux-based data center. With NetQ, network operations change from a manual, reactive, node-by-node approach to an automated, informed, and agile one. Visit {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/netq/" text="Network Operations and NetQ">}} to learn more.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation for network administrators who are responsible for deploying, configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting the network in their data center or campus environment.
