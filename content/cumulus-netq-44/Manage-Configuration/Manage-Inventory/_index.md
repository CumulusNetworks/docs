This topic describes how to use the NetQ UI and CLI to monitor your inventory from networkwide and device-specific perspectives.

You can monitor all hardware and software components installed and running on the switches and hosts across the entire network. This is very useful for understanding the dependence on various vendors and versions, when planning upgrades or the scope of any other required changes.

From a networkwide view, you can monitor all switches and hosts at one time, or you can monitor all switches at one time. You cannot currently monitor all hosts at one time separate from switches.
