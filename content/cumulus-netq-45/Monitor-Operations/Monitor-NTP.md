Use the CLI to view Network Time Protocol (NTP). The command output displays the time synchronization status for all devices. You can filter for devices that are either in synchronization or out of synchronization, currently or at a time in the past.

Monitor NTP with the following command. See the {{<link title="show/#netq-show-ntp" text="command line reference">}} for additional options, definitions, and examples.

```
netq show ntp
```
