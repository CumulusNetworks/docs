Cards present information about your network for monitoring and troubleshooting; each card describes a particular aspect of the network. Cards are collected onto a {{<link title="Focus Your Monitoring Using Workbenches" text="workbench">}} where all data relevant to a task or set of tasks is visible. You can add and remove cards from a workbench, increase or decrease their sizes, change the time period of the data shown on a card, and make copies of cards to show different levels of data at the same time.

## Available Cards

Each card focuses on a particular aspect of your network. They include:

- **Validation summary**: overview of your network's health
- **Events**: system events and anomalies
- **What Just Happened**: network issues and packet drops 
- **Device groups**: distribution of device components
- **Trace request**: discovery workflow for paths between two devices in the network fabric
- **MAC move commentary**: info about changes to a MAC address on a specific VLAN
- Network services cards: **BGP**, **MLAG**, **EVPN**, **OSPF**, and **LLDP**
- Inventory cards: **Devices**, **Switches**, **DPUs**, and **Hosts**

## Card Sizes

Cards are available in 4 sizes. The granularity of the content on a card varies with the size of the card, with the highest level of information on the smallest card to the most detailed information on the full-screen card.
