Workbenches are dashboards where you collect and view data. Two types of workbenches are available:

<!-- vale off -->
- **Default**: Provided by NVIDIA; you *cannot* save changes you make to these workbenches
- **Custom**: Created by the user; changes made to these workbenches are saved automatically
<!-- vale on -->

Both types of workbenches display a set of cards. Default workbenches are public (accessible to all users), whereas custom workbenches are private (viewing is restricted to the user who created them).
## Default Workbenches

The default workbench contains Device Inventory, Switch Inventory, Events, and Validation Summary cards, giving you a high-level view of how your network is operating.

Upon initial login, the NetQ Workbench opens. Upon subsequent logins, the last workbench you viewed opens.

## Custom Workbenches

People with either administrative or user roles can create and save an unlimited number of custom workbenches. For example, you might create a workbench that:

- Shows network statistics for the past week alongside network statistics for the past 24 hours.
- Only displays data about virtual overlays.
- Displays switches that you are troubleshooting.
- Is focused on application or account management.

## Manage Auto-refresh

You can specify how often to update the data displayed on your workbenches. Three refresh rates are available:

- **Analyze**: updates every 30 seconds
- **Debug**: updates every minute
- **Monitor**: updates every 2 minutes

By default, auto-refresh is configured to update every 30 seconds.

To modify the auto-refresh setting:

1. Select the dropdown <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/52-Arrows-Diagrams/01-Arrows/arrow-button-down-2.svg" width="18"/> next to **Refresh**.

2. Select the refresh rate. A check mark indicates the current selection. The new refresh rate is applied immediately.
