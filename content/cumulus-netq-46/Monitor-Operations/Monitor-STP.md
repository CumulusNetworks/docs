Use the CLI to view the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) topology on a bridge or switch.

Monitor STP with the following command. If you do not have a bridge in your configuration, the output indicates such. See the {{<link title="show/#netq-show-stp-topology" text="command line reference">}} for additional options, definitions, and examples.

```
netq show stp topology
```
