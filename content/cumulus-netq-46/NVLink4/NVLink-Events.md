The NetQ UI displays two categories of events: NVLink events and system events. NVLink events are those related to the Local Fabric Manager, Global Fabric Manager, and L1 and L2 NVSwitch devices. System events include a broad range of events generated by NetQ itself that are related to network protocols and services operation, hardware and software status, and system services.

All events are categorized according to two severity levels: info or error, and are updated every 60 seconds. This means that if an event is created or resolved, it will take up to 60 seconds for its updated status to be reflected in the UI.

{{<notice note>}}
You must enable NVLink features with the <code>netq features nvl4 enable</code> command for NVLink events to appear in the UI.

## Monitor NVLink Events in the UI


1. Expand the {{<img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/03-Menu/navigation-menu.svg" height="18" width="18">}} **Menu**, then select **Events**.

    The dashboard presents a timeline of events with a list of devices that are generating the most events. 

    {{<figure src="/images/netq/new-nvlink-events-460.png" width="1200" alt="Events dashboard with NVLink events.">}}

  The devices list includes a 'Context' column that indicates the NVLink domain's name, and a 'Type' column that reflects the event's classification as an NVLink event or a system event. See the {{<link title="System Event Messages Reference">}} for a comprehensive list of system events generated by NetQ.

  Use the controls at the top of the dashboard to filter events by time, device (hostname), type, severity, or state.
