The NetQ UI displays two types of events: events generated by L1 and L2 NVSwitches, and events generated by NetQ itself. NVLink events are those related to the local fabric manager, global fabric manager, and NVSwitch devices.

All events are categorized according to two severity levels: info or error. Events are updated every 60 seconds.
