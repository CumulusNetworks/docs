In either in-band or out-of-band deployments, NetQ offers networkwide configuration and device management, proactive monitoring capabilities, and network performance diagnostics.

## The NetQ Agent

From a software perspective, a network switch has software associated with the hardware platform, the operating system, and communications. For data centers, the software on a network switch is similar to the following diagram:

{{<figure src="/images/netq/netq-agent-operation-diag.png" alt="diagram illustrating how the NetQ Agent interacts with a switch or host." width="500">}}

The NetQ Agent interacts with the various components and software on switches and hosts and provides the gathered information to the NetQ Platform. You can view the data using the NetQ CLI or UI.

The NetQ Agent polls the user space applications for information about the performance of the various routing protocols and services that are running on the switch. Cumulus Linux supports BGP and OSPF routing protocols as well as static addressing through FRRouting (FRR). Cumulus Linux also supports LLDP and MSTP among other protocols, and a variety of services such as systemd and sensors. SONiC supports BGP and LLDP.

For hosts, the NetQ Agent also polls for performance of containers managed with Kubernetes. This information is used to calculate the network's health and check if the network is configured and operating correctly.

The NetQ Agent interacts with the Netlink communications between the Linux kernel and the user space, listening for changes to the network state, configurations, routes, and MAC addresses. NetQ sends notifications about these changes so that network operators and administrators can respond quickly when changes are not expected or favorable.

The NetQ Agent also interacts with the hardware platform to obtain performance information about various physical components, such as fans and power supplies, on the switch. The agent measures operational states and temperatures, along with cabling information to allow for proactive maintenance.

## The NetQ Platform

After the collected data is sent to and stored in the NetQ database, you can:

  - Validate configurations and identify misconfigurations in your current network or in a previous deployment.
  - Monitor communication paths throughout the network.
  - Notify users of network issues.
  - Anticipate the impact of connectivity changes.

### Validate Configurations

The NetQ CLI lets you validate your network's health through two sets of commands: `netq check` and `netq show`. They extract the information from the network service component and event service. The network service component is continually validating the connectivity and configuration of the devices and protocols running on the network. Using the `netq check` and `netq show` commands displays the status of the various components and services on a networkwide and complete software stack basis. `netq check` and `netq show` commands are available for the following components and services:

| Component or Service | Check | Show | Component or Service | Check | Show |
| -------------------- | :---: | :---:| -------------------- | :---: | :---: |
| Agents | X | X | LLDP |  | X |
| BGP | X | X | MACs |   | X |
| MLAG (CLAG) | X | X | MTU | X |  |
| Events |  | X | NTP | X | X |
| EVPN | X | X | OSPF | X | X |
| Interfaces | X | X | Sensors | X | X |
| Inventory  |  | X | Services |   | X |
| IPv4/v6 |  | X | VLAN | X | X |
| Kubernetes |  | X | VXLAN | X | X |

### Monitor Communication Paths

The trace engine validates the available communication paths between two network devices. The corresponding `netq trace` command enables you to view all of the paths between the two devices and if there are any breaks in the paths. For more information about trace requests, refer to {{<link title="Verify Network Connectivity" text="Verify Network Connectivity">}}.

### View Historical State and Configuration Info

You can run all check, show, and trace commands for current and past statuses. To investigate past issues, use the `netq check` command and look for configuration or operational issues around the time that NetQ timestamped event messages. Then use the `netq show` commands to view information about device configurations. You can also use the `netq trace` command to see what the connectivity looked like between any problematic nodes at a particular time. 

For example, the following diagram shows issues on spine01, leaf04, and server03: 

{{<figure src="/images/netq/netq-ops-historic-230.png" alt="network diagram displaying issues on spine01, leaf04, and server03" width="900">}}

An administrator can run the following commands from any switch in the network to determine the cause of a BGP error on spine01:

### Manage Network Events

The NetQ notifier lets you capture and filter events for devices, components, protocols, and services. This is especially useful when an interface or routing protocol goes down and you want to get them back up and running as quickly as possible. You can improve resolution time significantly by creating filters that focus on topics appropriate for a particular group of users. You can create filters for events related to BGP and MLAG session states, interfaces, links, NTP and other services, fans, power supplies, and physical sensor measurements.

The following is an example of a Slack message received on a *netq-notifier* channel indicating that the BGP session on switch *leaf04* interface *swp2* has gone down:

{{<figure src="/images/netq/slack-msg-example.png" alt="example Slack message from netq notifier indicating session failures" width="500">}}

For more information, refer to {{<link title="Events and Notifications" text="Events and Notifications">}}.

## Timestamps in NetQ

Every event or entry in the NetQ database is stored with a timestamp that reports when the NetQ Agent captured an event on the switch or server. This timestamp is based on the switch or server time where the NetQ Agent is running, and is pushed in UTC format.

Interface state, IP addresses, routes, ARP/ND table (IP neighbor) entries and MAC table entries carry a timestamp that represents the time an event occurred (such as when a route is deleted or an interface comes up).

Data that is captured and saved based on polling has a timestamp according to when the information was *captured* rather than when the event *actually happened*, though NetQ compensates for this if the data extracted provides additional information to compute a more precise time of the event. For example, BGP uptime can be used to determine when the event actually happened in conjunction with the timestamp.

<!--- 
When retrieving the timestamp, command outputs display the time in three ways:

- For non-JSON output when the timestamp represents the Last Changed time, time is displayed in actual date and time when the time change occurred
- For non-JSON output when the timestamp represents an Uptime, time is displayed as days, hours, minutes, and seconds from the current time
- For JSON output, time is displayed in microseconds that have passed since the Epoch time (January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 GMT)

{{%notice note%}}

Restarting a NetQ Agent on a device does not update the timestamps for existing objects to reflect this new restart time. NetQ preserves their timestamps relative to the original start time of the Agent. A rare exception is if you reboot the device between the time it takes the Agent to stop and restart; in this case, the time is still relative to the start time of the Agent.

## Exporting NetQ Data

You can export data from the NetQ Platform in the CLI or UI:

- In the CLI, use the `json` option to output command results to JSON format for parsing in other applications
- In the UI, expand the cards to a full-screen, tabular view and select export <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/05-Internet-Networks-Servers/08-Upload-Download/upload-bottom.svg" height="18" width="18"/>
