View events generated by NVLink devices and NetQ in the events dashboard. The dashboard displays LFM and GFM status events, events related to the health of NVLink switches, and the severity levels of those events. The dashboard also displays timestamp data and ASIC IDs to help with troubleshooting. The dashboard updates every 60 seconds.

## Monitor Events in the UI

The dashboard presents a timeline of events alongside the devices that are causing the most events. Select the **NVL4** tab to view events related exclusively to NVLink devices.
