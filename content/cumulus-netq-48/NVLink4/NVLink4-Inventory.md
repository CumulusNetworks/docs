Select the cards to add them to your workbench. There are two NVLink4 inventory cards---NVLink L1 Switches and NVLink Switches. You can also enter the name of the device in the global search field at the top of the dashboard and add the respective device card to your workbench.

When fully expanded, NVLink4 cards display a table with device statistics about cable ports, sensors, and digital optics. You can view additional data about each of these categories by selecting a sub-category in the header:
