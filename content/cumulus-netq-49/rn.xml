<td>In a NetQ cluster environment, if your master node goes offline and is restored, subsequent NetQ validations for MLAG and EVPN might unexpectedly indicate failures.

<td>When you install a NetQ cluster deployment on a subnet with other NetQ clusters or other devices using VRRP, there might be connectivity loss to the cluster virtual IP (VIP). The VIP is established using the VRRP protocol, and during cluster installation a virtual router ID (VRID) is selected. If another device on the subnet running VRRP selects the same VRID, connectivity issues may occur. To work around this issue, avoid multiple VRRP speakers on the subnet, or ensure the VRID used on all VRRP devices is unique. To validate the VRID used by NetQ, check the assigned {{virtual_router_id}} value in {{/mnt/keepalived/keepalived.conf}}.</td>
