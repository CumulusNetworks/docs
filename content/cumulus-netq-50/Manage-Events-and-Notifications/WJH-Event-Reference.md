This reference lists all the NetQ-supported What Just Happened (WJH) metrics and provides a brief description of each. The full outputs vary slightly based on the type of drop and whether you are viewing the results in the NetQ UI or through one of the NetQ CLI commands.

For instructions on how to configure and monitor What Just Happened events, refer to {{<link title="Configure and Monitor What Just Happened">}}.
## Layer 1 Drops

Describes why a port is in the down state.

In addition to the reason, the information provided for these drops includes:

| Parameter | Description|

| Aggregate Count  | Total number of dropped packets |
| Protocol | ID of the communication protocol running on this link |
| Ingress Port | Port accepting incoming traffic |
| OPID | Operation identifier; used for internal purposes |
<!-- vale on -->
## Router Drops

Describes why the server is unable to route a packet.

<!-- vale off -->
| Reason | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-routable packet |  Notice | Packet has no route in routing table |
| Blackhole route | Warning | Packet received with action equal to discard |
| Unresolved next hop | Warning | The next hop in the route is unknown |
| Blackhole ARP/neighbor | Warning | Packet received with blackhole adjacency |
| IPv6 destination in multicast scope FFx0:/16 | Notice | Packet received with multicast destination address in FFx0:/16 address range |
| IPv6 destination in multicast scope FFx1:/16 | Notice | Packet received with multicast destination address in FFx1:/16 address range |
| Non-IP packet | Notice | Cannot read packet header because it is not an IP packet |
| Unicast destination IP but non-unicast destination MAC | Error | Cannot read packet with IP unicast address when destination MAC address is not unicast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) |
| Destination IP is loopback address | Error | Cannot read packet as destination IP address is a loopback address (dip=>127.0.0.0/8) |
| Source IP is multicast | Error | Cannot read packet as source IP address is a multicast address (ipv4 SIP => 224.0.0.0/4) |
| Source IP is in class E | Error | Cannot read packet as source IP address is a Class E address |
| Source IP is loopback address | Error | Cannot read packet as source IP address is a loopback address (ipv4 => 127.0.0.0/8 for ipv6 => ::1/128) |
| Source IP is unspecified | Error | Cannot read packet as source IP address is unspecified (ipv4 = 0.0.0.0/32; for ipv6 = ::0) |
| Checksum or IP ver or IPv4 IHL too short | Error | Cannot read packet due to header checksum error, IP version mismatch, or IPv4 header length is too short |
| Multicast MAC mismatch |  Error | For IPv4, destination MAC address is not equal to {0x01-00-5E-0 (25 bits), DIP\[22:0\]} and DIP is multicast. For IPv6, destination MAC address is not equal to {0x3333, DIP\[31:0\]} and DIP is multicast |
| Source IP equals destination IP | Error | Packet has a source IP address equal to the destination IP address |
| IPv4 source IP is limited broadcast | Error | Packet has broadcast source IP address |
| IPv4 destination IP is local network (destination = 0.0.0.0/8) | Error | Packet has IPv4 destination address that is a local network (destination=0.0.0.0/8) |
| IPv4 destination IP is link-local (destination in 169.254.0.0/16) | Error | Packet has IPv4 destination address that is a local link |
| Ingress router interface is disabled | Warning | Packet destined to a different subnet cannot be routed because ingress router interface is disabled |
| Egress router interface is disabled | Warning | Packet destined to a different subnet cannot be routed because egress router interface is disabled |
| IPv4 routing table (LPM) unicast miss | Warning | No route available in routing table for packet |
| IPv6 routing table (LPM) unicast miss | Warning | No route available in routing table for packet |
| Router interface loopback | Warning | Packet has destination IP address that is local. For example, SIP = 1.1.1.1, DIP = 1.1.1.128. |
| Packet size is larger than MTU | Warning | Packet has larger MTU configured than the VLAN |
| TTL value is too small | Warning | Packet has TTL value of 1 |
<!-- vale on -->
## Tunnel Drops

Describes why a tunnel is down.

| Reason | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overlay switch - source MAC is multicast | Error | Overlay packet's source MAC address is multicast |
| Overlay switch - source MAC equals destination MAC | Error | Overlay packet's source MAC address is the same as the destination MAC address |
| Decapsulation error | Error | De-capsulation produced incorrect format of packet. For example, encapsulation of packet with many VLANs or IP options on the underlay can cause de-capsulation to result in a short packet. |
| Tunnel interface is disabled | Error | Packet cannot de-capsulate because the tunnel interface is disabled |

## Buffer Drops

Describes why the server buffer has dropped packets.

<!-- vale off -->
| Reason | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tail drop | Warning | Tail drop is enabled, and buffer queue is filled to maximum capacity |
| WRED | Warning | Weighted Random Early Detection is enabled, and buffer queue is filled to maximum capacity or the RED engine dropped the packet as of random congestion prevention |
| Port TC Congestion Threshold Crossed | Warning | Percentage of the occupancy buffer exceeded or dropped below the specified high or low threshold |
| Packet Latency Threshold Crossed | Warning | Time a packet spent within the switch exceeded or dropped below the specified high or low threshold |
## ACL Drops

Describes why an ACL has dropped packets.
