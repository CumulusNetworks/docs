NetQ NVLink collects telemetry data, monitors performance, and allows you to configure and manage NVLink deployments. It aggregates and streams telemetry metrics that you can access through a Prometheus endpoint or gRPC. You can use NetQ to manage NVLink network configurations and resources, and use it to allocate and reserve GPUs for AI workloads.

{{<notice tip>}}
NetQ NVLink was previously packaged as NMX-M.
