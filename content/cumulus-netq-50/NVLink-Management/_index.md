NVIDIA NVLink is a high-speed interconnect that allows multiple GPUs to communicate directly. You can use NetQ to configure and manage NVLink deployments, collect telemetry data, and monitor performance. NetQ aggregates and streams telemetry metrics that you can access through a Prometheus endpoint or gRPC. You can use the REST API to manage NVLink network configurations and resources, and allocate GPUs for AI workloads.

{{<notice tip>}}
NetQ NVLink was previously packaged as NMX-M.
