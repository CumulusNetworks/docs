With NetQ, a network administrator can monitor OSI Layer 1 physical
components on network devices, including interfaces, ports, links, and
peers. NetQ provides the ability to:

  - Manage physical inventory: view the performance and status of
    various components of a switch or host server
  - Validate configurations: verify the configuration of network peers
    and ports

It helps answer questions such as:

  - Are any individual or bonded links down?
  - Are any links flapping?
  - Is there a link mismatch anywhere in my network?
  - Which interface ports are empty?
  - Which transceivers are installed?
  - What is the peer for a given port?

NetQ uses [LLDP](/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/) (Link
Layer Discovery Protocol) to collect port information. NetQ can also
identify peer ports connected to DACs (Direct Attached Cables) and AOCs
(Active Optical Cables) without using LLDP, even if the link is not UP.

## Monitor Physical Layer Inventory

Keeping track of the various physical layer components in your switches
and servers ensures you have a fully functioning network and provides
inventory management and audit capabilities. You can monitor ports,
transceivers, and cabling deployed on a per port (interface), per
vendor, per part number and so forth. NetQ enables you to view the
current status and the status an earlier point in time. From this
information, you can, among other things:

  - determine which ports are empty versus which ones have cables
    plugged in and thereby validate expected connectivity
  - audit transceiver and cable components used by vendor, giving you
    insights for estimated replacement costs, repair costs, overall
    costs, and so forth to improve your maintenance and purchasing
    processes
  - identify changes in your physical layer, and when they occurred

The `netq show interfaces physical` command is used to obtain the
information from the devices. Its syntax is:

    netq [<hostname>] show interfaces physical [<physical-port>] [empty|plugged] [peer] [vendor <module-vendor>|model <module-model>|module] [around <text-time>] [json]
    netq [<hostname>] show events [level info|level error|level warning|level critical|level debug] type interfaces-physical [between <text-time> and <text-endtime>] [json]

{{%notice note%}}

When entering a time value, you must include a numeric value *and* the
unit of measure:

  - d: day(s)
  - h: hour(s)
  - m: minute(s)
  - s: second(s)
  - now

For time ranges, the `<text-time>` is the most recent time and the
`<text-endtime>` is the oldest time. The values are not required to have the
same unit of measure.

### View Detailed Cable Information for All Devices

You can view what cables are connected to each interface port for all
devices, including the module type, vendor, part number and performance
characteristics. You can also view the cable information for a given
device by adding a hostname to the `show` command. This example shows
cable information and status for all interface ports on all devices.

### View Detailed Module Information for a Given Device

You can view detailed information about the transceiver modules on each
interface port, including serial number, transceiver type, connector and
attached cable length. You can also view the module information for a
given device by adding a hostname to the `show` command. This example
shows the detailed module information for the interface ports on *leaf02*
switch.

### View Ports without Cables Connected for a Given Device

Checking for empty ports enables you to compare expected versus actual
deployment. This can be very helpful during deployment or during
upgrades. You can also view the cable information for a given device by
adding a hostname to the `show` command. This example shows the ports
that are empty on leaf01 switch.

    cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf01 show interfaces physical empty
    Matching cables records are:
    Hostname         Interface State Speed      AutoNeg Module    Vendor           Part No          Last Changed

### View Ports with Cables Connected for a Given Device

In a similar manner as checking for empty ports, you can check for ports
that have cables connected, enabling you to compare expected versus
actual deployment. You can also view the cable information for a given
device by adding a hostname to the `show` command. If you add the around
keyword, you can view which interface ports had cables connected at a
previous time. This example shows the ports of *leaf01* switch that have
attached cables.

    cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf01 show interfaces physical plugged

### View Components from a Given Vendor

By filtering for a specific cable vendor, you can collect information
such as how many ports use components from that vendor and when they
were last updated. This information may be useful when you run a cost
analysis of your network. This example shows all the ports that are
using components by an *OEM* vendor.

    cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf01 show interfaces physical vendor OEM

### View All Devices Using a Given Component

You can view all of the devices with ports using a particular component.
This could be helpful when you need to change out a particular component
for possible failure issues, upgrades, or cost reasons. This example
first determines which models (part numbers) exist on all of the devices
and then those devices with a part number of QSFP-H40G-CU1M installed.

### View Changes to Physical Components

Because components are often changed, NetQ enables you to determine
what, if any, changes have been made to the physical components on your
devices. This can be helpful during deployments or upgrades.

You can select how far back in time you want to go, or select a time
range using the between keyword. Note that time values must include
units to be valid. If no changes are found, a "No matching cable records
found" message is displayed. This example illustrates each of these
scenarios for all devices in the network.

## Validate Physical Layer Configuration

Beyond knowing what physical components are deployed, it is valuable to
know that they are configured and operating correctly. NetQ enables you
to confirm that peer connections are present, discover any misconfigured
ports, peers, or unsupported modules, and monitor for link flaps.

NetQ checks peer connections using LLDP. For DACs and AOCs, NetQ
determines the peers using their serial numbers in the port EEPROMs,
even if the link is not UP.

### Confirm Peer Connections

You can validate peer connections for all devices in your network or for
a specific device or port. This example shows the peer hosts and their
status for leaf03 switch.

```
cumulus@switch:~$ netq leaf03 show interfaces physical peer

```

### Discover Misconfigurations

You can verify that the following configurations are the same on both
sides of a peer interface:

  - Admin state
  - Operational state
  - Link speed
  - Auto-negotiation setting

The `netq check interfaces` command is used to determine if any of the
interfaces have any continuity errors. This command only checks the
physical interfaces; it does not check bridges, bonds or other software
constructs. You can check all interfaces at once. It enables you to
compare the current status of the interfaces, as well as their status at
an earlier point in time. The command syntax is:

    netq check interfaces [around <text-time>] [json]

{{%notice tip%}}

If NetQ cannot determine a peer for a given device, the port is marked
as *unverified*.

{{%/notice%}}

If you find a misconfiguration, use the `netq show interfaces physical`
command for clues about the cause.

**Example: Find Mismatched Operational States**

In this example, we check all of the interfaces for misconfigurations
and we find that one interface port has an error. We look for clues
about the cause and see that the Operational states do not match on the
connection between leaf 03 and leaf04: leaf03 is up, but leaf04 is down.
If the misconfiguration was due to a mismatch in the administrative
state, the message would have been *Admin state mismatch (up, down)* or
*Admin state mismatch (down, up)*.

**Example: Find Mismatched Peers**

This example uses the *and* keyword to check the connections between two
peers. An error is seen, so we check the physical peer information and
discover that the incorrect peer has been specified. After fixing it, we
run the check again, and see that there are no longer any interface
errors.

You can also determine whether a link is flapping using the `netq check
interfaces` command. If a link is flapping, NetQ indicates this in a
