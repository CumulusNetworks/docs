This guide is intended for network administrators who are responsible
for monitoring and troubleshooting the network in their data center
environment. NetQ 2.x offers the ability to easily monitor and manage
your data center network infrastructure and operational health. This
guide provides instructions and information about monitoring individual
components of the network, the network as a whole, and the NetQ software
itself using the NetQ command line interface (CLI). If you prefer to use
a graphical interface, refer to the [Cumulus NetQ UI User Guide](/cumulus-netq/Cumulus-NetQ-UI-User-Guide/).
