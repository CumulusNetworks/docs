NetQ 2.x data is stored in a Cassandra database. A backup is performed by running scripts provided with the software and located in the `/usr/sbin` directory. When a backup is performed, a single tar file is created. The file is stored on a local drive that you specify and is named `netq_master_snapshot_<timestamp>.tar.gz`. Currently, only one backup file is supported, and includes the entire set of data tables. It is replaced each time a new backup is created.

{{%notice note%}}
If you upgrading to version 2.3.0 and need to back up NetQ 2.2.2 or earlier, you must request an updated `backuprestore` script from your local representative. The new script must be manually copied into the `user/sbin` directory.

If you are upgrading to version 2.3.1, you can use the script provided with the release to back up your data from earlier NetQ versions.

To create a backup:

1. Run the backup script to create a backup file in `/opt/<backup-directory>` being sure to replace the `backup-directory` option with the name of the directory you want to use for the backup file.
   ```
   cumulus@<netq-platform/netq-appliance>:~$ ./backuprestore.sh --backup --localdir /opt/<backup-directory>
   ```
   {{%notice tip%}}

You can abbreviate the `backup` and `localdir` options of this command to `-b` and `-l` to reduce typing. If the backup directory identified does not already exist, the script creates the directory during the backup process.

   This is a sample of what you see as the script is running:
   ```

   [Fri 26 Jul 2019 02:35:48 PM UTC] - Backup finished successfully!
   ```

2. Verify the backup file has been created.

   ```
   cumulus@<netq-platform/netq-appliance>:~$ cd /opt/<backup-directory>
   cumulus@<netq-platform/netq-appliance>:~/opt/<backup-directory># ls
   netq_master_snapshot_2019-06-04_07_24_50_UTC.tar.gz
   ```
To create a scheduled backup, add `./backuprestore.sh --backup --localdir /opt/<backup-directory>` to an existing cron job, or create a new one.
