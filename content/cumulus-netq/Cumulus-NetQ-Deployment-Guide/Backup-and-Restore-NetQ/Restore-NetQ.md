You can restore NetQ data using the backup file you created in [Backup Your NetQ Instance](../Backup-NetQ/). You can restore your instance to the same NetQ Platform or NetQ Appliance or to a new platform or appliance. You do not need to stop the server where the backup file resides to perform the restoration, but logins to the NetQ UI will fail during the restoration process.The restore option of the backup script, copies the data from the backup file to the database, decompresses it, verifies the restoration, and starts all necessary services. You should not see any data loss as a result of a restore operation.

To restore NetQ on the same hardware where the backup file resides:

1. Log in to the NetQ server.
2. Run the restore script being sure to replace the `backup-directory` option with the name of the directory where the backup file resides.
   ```
   cumulus@<netq-platform/netq-appliance>:~$ ./backuprestore.sh --restore --localdir /opt/<backup-directory>
   ```
   {{%notice tip%}}

   You can abbreviate the `restore` and `localdir` options of this command to `-r` and `-l` to reduce typing.

   This is a sample of what you see while the script is running:
   ```
   [Fri 26 Jul 2019 02:37:49 PM UTC] - Received Inputs for restore ...

   WARNING: Restore procedure wipes out the existing contents of Database.
     Once the Database is restored you loose the old data and cannot be recovered.
   "Do you like to continue with Database restore:[Y(yes)/N(no)]. (Default:N)"
   ```
      You must answer the above question to continue the restoration. After entering **Y** or **yes**, the output continues as follows:
      ```

      ```

To restore NetQ on new hardware:

1. Copy the backup file from `/opt/<backup-directory>` on the older hardware to the backup directory on the new hardware.
2. Run the restore script on the new hardware, being sure to replace the `backup-directory` option with the name of the directory where the backup file resides.

   ```
   cumulus@<netq-platform/netq-appliance>:~$ ./backuprestore.sh --restore --localdir /opt/<backup-directory>
   ```
