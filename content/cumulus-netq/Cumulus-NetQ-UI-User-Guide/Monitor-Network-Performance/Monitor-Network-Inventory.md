With NetQ, a network administrator can monitor both the switch hardware
and its operating system for misconfigurations or misbehaving services.
The Devices Inventory card workflow provides a view into the switches
and hosts installed in your network and their various hardware and
software components. The workflow contains a small card with a count of
each device type in your network, a medium card displaying the operating
systems running on each set of devices, large cards with component
information statistics, and full-screen cards displaying tables with
attributes of all switches and all hosts in your network.

The Devices Inventory card workflow helps answer questions such as:

  - What switches do I have in the network?
  - What is the distribution of ASICs across my network?
  - Do all switches have valid licenses?
  - Are NetQ agents running on all of my switches?

For monitoring inventory and performance on a switch-by-switch basis,
refer to the [Monitor Switches](../../Monitor-Devices/Monitor-Switches).

## View the Number of Each Device Type in Your Network

You can view the number of switches and
hosts deployed in your network. As you grow your network this can be
useful for validating that devices have been added as scheduled.

To view the quantity of devices in your network, open the small Devices Inventory card.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-small-230.png" width="200" >}}

{{%notice tip%}}

Chassis are not monitored in this release, so an N/A (not applicable)
value is displayed for these devices, even if you have chassis in your
network.

{{%/notice%}}

## View Which Operating Systems Are Running on Your Network Devices

You can view the distribution of operating systems running on your
switches and hosts. This is useful for verifying which versions of the
OS are deployed and for upgrade planning. It also provides a view into
the relative dependence on a given OS in your network.

To view the OS distribution, open the medium Devices Inventory card if
it is not already on your workbench.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-medium-230.png" width="200" >}}

## View Switch Components

To view switch components, open the large Devices Inventory card. By
default the Switches tab is shown displaying the total number of
switches, ASIC vendor, OS versions, license status, NetQ Agent versions,
and specific platforms deployed on all of your switches.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-large-switches-tab-230.png" width="500" >}}

### Highlight a Selected Component Type

You can hover over any of the segments in a component distribution chart
to highlight a specific type of the given component. When you *hover*, a
tooltip appears displaying:

  - the name or value of the component type, such as the version number
    or status
  - the total number of switches with that type of component deployed
    compared to the total number of switches
  - percentage of this type with respect to all component types.  

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-large-switches-tab-component-highlight-230.png" width="650" >}}

Additionally, sympathetic highlighting is used to show the related
component types relevant to the highlighted segment and the number of
unique component types associated with this type (shown in blue here).

### Focus on a Selected Component Type

To dig deeper on a particular component type, you can filter the card
data by that type. In this procedure, the result of filtering on the OS
is shown.

To view component type data:

1.  Click a segment of the component distribution charts.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-large-switches-tab-component-filter.png" width="300" >}}

2.  Select the first option from the popup, *Filter* \<*component
    name*\>. The card data is filtered to show only the components
    associated with selected component type. A filter tag appears next
    to the total number of switches indicating the filter criteria.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-large-switches-tab-component-filter-os-230.png" width="250" >}}

3.  Hover over the segments to view the related components.

    {{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-large-switches-tab-component-highlight2-230.png" width="500" >}}

4.  To return to the full complement of components, click the <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/close.svg", height="14", width="14"/> in the filter tag.

### Navigate to the Switch Inventory Workflow

While the Device Inventory cards provide a network-wide view, you may
want to see more detail about your switch inventory. This can be found
in the Switches Inventory card workflow. To open that workflow, click
the **Switch Inventory** button at the top right of the Switches card.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-large-switches-tab-switch-inv-button-230.png" width="500" >}}

## View All Switches

You can view all stored attributes for all switches in your network. To
view all switch details, open the full screen Devices Inventory card and
click the **All Switches** tab in the navigation panel.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-fullscr-allswitches-tab-230.png" width="700" >}}

To return to your workbench, click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/close.svg", height="14", width="14"/> in the top right corner of the card.

## View All Hosts

You can view all stored attributes for all hosts in your network. To
view all hosts details, open the full screen Devices Inventory card and
click the **All Hosts** tab in the navigation panel.

{{< figure src="/images/netq/inventory-devices-fullscr-allhosts-tab-230.png" width="700" >}}

To return to your workbench, click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/close.svg", height="14", width="14"/> in the top right corner of the card.
