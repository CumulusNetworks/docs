As an administrator, you have two major tasks related to managing Cumulus NetQ:

- [Application Management](../NetQ-Configuration-Management/Application-Management): manage access to and various application-wide settings for the Cumulus NetQ UI from a single location
- [Lifecycle Management](../NetQ-Configuration-Management/Lifecycle-Management): manage the software deployment onto your network devices

The NetQ UI makes both of these tasks easier than ever.
