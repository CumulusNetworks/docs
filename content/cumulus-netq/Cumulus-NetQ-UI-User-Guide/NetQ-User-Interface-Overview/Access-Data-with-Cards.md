Cards present information about your network for monitoring and
troubleshooting. This is where you can expect to spend most of your
time. Each card describes a particular aspect of the network. Cards are
available in multiple sizes, from small to full screen. The level of the
content on a card varies in accordance with the size of the card, with
the highest level of information on the smallest card to the most
detailed information on the full-screen card. Cards are collected onto a
workbench where you see all of the data relevant to a task or set of
tasks. You can add and remove cards from a workbench, move between cards
and card sizes, change the time period of the data shown on a card, and make copies of cards to show different levels of
data at the same time.

## Card Sizes

The various sizes of cards enables you to view your content at just the
right level. For each aspect that you are monitoring there is typically
a single card, that presents increasing amounts of data over its four
sizes. For example, a snapshot of your total inventory may be
sufficient, but to monitor the distribution of hardware vendors may
requires a bit more space.

### Small Cards

Small cards are most effective at providing a quick view of the
performance or statistical value of a given aspect of your network. They
are commonly comprised of an icon to identify the aspect being
monitored, summary performance or statistics in the form of a graph
and/or counts, and often an indication of any related events. Other
content items may be present. Some examples include a Devices Inventory
card, a Switch Inventory card, an Alarm Events card, an Info Events
card, and a Network Health card, as shown here:

{{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/access-data-small-group-230.png" width="700" >}}

### Medium Cards

Medium cards are most effective at providing the key measurements for a
given aspect of your network. They are commonly comprised of an icon to
identify the aspect being monitored, one or more key measurements that
make up the overall performance. Often additional information is also
included, such as related events or components. Some examples include a
Devices Inventory card, a Switch Inventory card, an Alarm Events card,
an Info Events card, and a Network Health card, as shown here. Compare
these with their related small- and large-sized cards.

{{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/access-data-medium-group-230.png" width="700" >}}

### Large Cards

Large cards are most effective at providing the detailed information for
monitoring specific components or functions of a given aspect of your
network. These can aid in isolating and resolving existing issues or
preventing potential issues. They are commonly comprised of detailed
statistics and graphics. Some large cards also have tabs for additional
detail about a given statistic or other related information. Some
examples include a Devices Inventory card, an Alarm Events card, and a
Network Health card, as shown here. Compare these with their related
small- and medium-sized cards.

{{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/access-data-large-group-230.png" width="500" >}}

### Full-Screen Cards

Full-screen cards are most effective for viewing all available data
about an aspect of your network all in one place. When you cannot find
what you need in the small, medium, or large cards, it is likely on the
full-screen card. Most full-screen cards display data in a grid, or
table; however, some contain visualizations. Some examples include All
Events card and All Switches card, as shown here.

## Card Workflows

The UI provides a number of card workflows. Card workflows focus on a
particular aspect of your network and are a linked set of each size
cardâ€”a small card, a medium card, one or more large cards, and one or
more full screen cards. The following card workflows are available:

  - **Network Health**: network-wide view of network health
  - **Devices|Switches**: health of a given switch
  - **Inventory|Devices**: information about all switches and hosts in
    the network
  - **Inventory|Switches**: information about the components on a given
    switch
  - **Events|Alarms**: information about all critical severity events in
    the system
  - **Events|Info**: information about all warning, info, and debug
    events in the system
  - **Network Services**: information about the network services and
    sessions
  - **Validation Request** (and Results): network-wide validation of
    network protocols and services
  - **Trace Request** (and Results): find available paths between two
    devices in the network fabric

### Access a Card Workflow

You can access a card workflow in multiple ways:

  - For workbenches available from the main menu, open the workbench
    that contains the card flow
  - Open a prior search
  - Add it to a workbench
  - Search for it

{{%notice tip%}}

If you have multiple cards open on your workbench already, you might
need to scroll down to see the card you have just added.

    The card appears on a current workbench, at the bottom.

## Card Interactions

Every card contains a standard set of interactions, including the
ability to switch between card sizes, and change the time period of the
presented data. Most cards also have additional actions that can be
taken, in the form of links to other cards, scrolling, and so forth. The
four sizes of cards for a particular aspect of the network are connected
into a flow; however, you can have duplicate cards displayed at the
different sizes. Cards with tabular data provide filtering, sorting, and
export of data. The medium and large cards have descriptive text on the
back of the cards.

To access the time period, card size, and additional actions, hover over
the card. These options appear, covering the card header, enabling you
to select the desired option.

### Add Cards to Your Workbench

You can add one or more cards to a workbench at any time. To add Devices|Switches cards, refer to [Add Switch Cards to Your Workbench](#add-switch-cards-to-your-workbench). For all other cards, follow the steps in this section.

To add one or more cards:

1.  Click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/44-Entertainment-Event-Hobbies/02-Card-Games/card-game-diamond.svg", height="18", width="18"/> to open the **Cards** modal.

    {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/add-card-modal-all-cards-222.png" width="700" >}}

2.  Scroll down until you find the card you want to add, or select the category of cards to find the card you want to add.

      {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/add-card-modal-ntwk-svcs-222.png" width="700" >}}

3. Click on each card you want to add.

      As you select each card, it is grayed out and a <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/33-Form-Validation/check-circle-1.svg", height="18", width="18"/> appears on top of it. If you have selected one or more cards using the category option, you can selected another category without losing your current selection. Note that the total number of cards selected for addition to your workbench is noted at the bottom.

      {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/add-card-2-selected-222.png" width="700" >}}

      Also note that if you change your mind and do not want to add a particular card you have selected, simply click on it again to remove it from the cards to be added. Note the total number of cards selected decreases with each card you remove.

4. When you have selected all of the cards you want to add to your workbench, you can confirm which cards have been selected by clicking the **Cards Selected** link. Modify your selection as needed.

      {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/add-card-confirm-selection-222.png" width="700" >}}

5. Click **Open Cards** to add the selected cards, or **Cancel** to return to your workbench without adding any cards.

The cards are placed at the end of the set of cards currently on the
workbench. You might need to scroll down to see them. By default, the
medium size of the card is added to your workbench for all except the Validation and Trace cards. These are added in the large size by default. You can rearrange the cards as described in [Reposition a Card on Your Workbench](#reposition-a-card-on-your-workbench).

### Add Switch Cards to Your Workbench

You can add switch cards to a workbench at any time. For all other cards, follow the steps in [Add Cards to Your Workbench](#add-cards-to-your-workbench).

To add a switch card:

1.  Click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/03-Computers-Devices-Electronics/09-Hard-Drives/hard-drive-1.svg", height="18", width="18"/> to open the Add Switch Card modal.

    {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/add-switch-card-modal-222.png" width="250" >}}

2. Begin entering the hostname of the switch you want to monitor.

3. Select the device from the suggestions that appear.

      {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/add-switch-card-auto-suggest-222.png" width="250" >}}

      {{%notice tip%}}

If you attempt to enter a hostname that is unknown to NetQ, a pink border appears around the entry field and you are unable to select **Add**. Try checking for spelling errors. If you feel your entry is valid, but not an available choice, consult with your network administrator.

      {{%/notice%}}

4. Optionally select the small or large size to display instead of the medium size.

5. Click **Add** to add the switch card to your workbench, or **Cancel** to return to your workbench without adding the switch card.

### Remove Cards from Your Workbench

Removing cards is handled one card at a time.

To remove a card:

1.  Hover over the card you want to remove.
2.  Click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/03-Menu/navigation-menu-horizontal.svg", height="18", width="18"/> (*More Actions* menu).
3.  Click **Remove**.

    {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/remove-card-222.png" width="100" >}}

The card is removed from the workbench, but not from the application.

### Change the Time Period for the Card Data

All cards have a default time period for the data shown on the card,
typically the last 24 hours. You can change the time period to view the
data during a different time range to aid analysis of previous or
existing issues.

To change the time period for a card:

1.  Hover over any card.
2.  Click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/01-Interface-Essential/18-Time/time-stopwatch.svg", height="18", width="18"/> in the header.
3.  Select a time period from the dropdown list.

    {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/time-picker-popup-222.png" width="200" >}}

{{%notice tip%}}

Changing the time period in this manner only changes the time period for
the given card.

{{%/notice%}}

### Switch to a Different Card Size

You can switch between the different card sizes at any time. Only one
size is visible at a time. To view the same card in different sizes,
open a second copy of the card.

To change the card size:

1.  Hover over the card.
2.  Hover over the Card Size Picker and move the cursor to the right or
    left until the desired size option is highlighted.

    {{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/card-size-picker-222.png" width="200" >}}

    Single width opens a small card. Double width opens a medium card.
    Triple width opens large cards. Full width opens full-screen cards.

3.  Click the Picker.  
    The card changes to the selected size, and may move its location on
    the workbench.

### View a Description of the Card Content

When you hover over a medium or large card, the bottom right corner
turns up and is highlighted. Clicking the corner turns the card over
where a description of the card and any relevant tabs are described.
Hover and click again to turn it back to the front side.

{{< figure src="https://dkahegywkrw3e.cloudfront.net/images/netq/card-desc-on-back-222.png" width="400" >}}

### Reposition a Card on Your Workbench

You can also move cards around on the workbench, using a simple drag and
drop method.

To move a card:

1.  Simply click and drag the card to left or right of another card,
    next to where you want to place the card.
2.  Release your hold on the card when the other card becomes
    highlighted with a dotted line. In this example, we are moving the
    medium Network Health card to the left of the medium Devices
    Inventory card.

## Card Decks

{{%notice note%}}

This option only applies to NetQ 2.1.0 through 2.2.1. It has been removed from NetQ 2.2.2 and later.

{{%/notice%}}

A card deck is a collection of related cards that can be added and
removed from a workbench all at once. They are distinct from card
workflows, which focus on a particular aspect of your network. A card
deck pulls multiple cards with related information to aid the user in
performing a broader task. It also simplifies the creation of new
workbenches when a card deck is available. The following card decks are
provided by default:

  - **Inventory**: includes the medium Inventory | Switches and
    Inventory | Devices cards
  - **Events**: includes the medium Events | Alarms and Events | Info
    cards

To add a card deck:

1.  Click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/44-Entertainment-Event-Hobbies/02-Card-Games/card-game-cards.svg", height="18", width="18"/> in the workbench task bar.
2.  Select the deck you want to add to your workbench.
