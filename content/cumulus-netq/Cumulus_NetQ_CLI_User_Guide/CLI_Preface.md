Cumulus NetQ and to take advantage of its monitoring and analytic
capabilities. These resources are identified here along with information
about how the content is presented.

## <span>What's New in Cumulus NetQ 2.1</span>

Cumulus NetQ has been reinvented to scale with the fast adoption rate of
open networks and rapid network growth. In addition to the real-time
data collection and fabric-wide performance analysis that are already
supported in Cumulus NetQ 1.4.1, Cumulus NetQ now offers a graphical
user interface for:

  - Data visualizations of the overlay and underlay networks,

  - Simplified network troubleshooting with network-wide roll-ups of
    health and alarm status in a single card, and

  - Proactive validation of the network status and configuration to
    regularly detect network issues.

**Cumulus NetQ 2.1.1** includes the following new features and
improvements:

  - Updates to the NetQ UI, including:
    
      - Added scheduled validations that let you schedule when to
        validate the operation of the network protocols and services
        running in your network
    
      - Added Management workbench which provides a single location to
        manage access to the NetQ UI, as well as view, add, and export
        scheduled validations and traces
    
      - Improved display of trace results on the full screen Trace
        Results card
    
      - Collapsed Navigation History into a menu to provide additional
        space for cards on the workbench
    
      - Added user option to display the application in a light or dark
        color theme

  - Fixes for a number of issues. See Issues Fixed in Cumulus NetQ 2.1.1
    below.

  - The LNV protocol is deprecated with this NetQ release. It is
    supported only through the NetQ CLI and API for users on Cumulus
    Linux 3.7.x and earlier.

**Cumulus NetQ 2.1.0** includes the following new features and
improvements:

  - Modern microservices architecture enables scalable and agile network
    with real-time data collection

  - Supports up to 1,000 nodes

  - Graphical User Interface (UI) provides a visual representation of
    the health and operation of the network, network devices and events
    
      - Monitor network-wide health
    
      - Monitor individual device health and configuration
    
      - View network devices inventory and device component inventory
    
      - Monitor and validate network protocol and services operation
    
      - Track alarms and informational events across the network and for
        individual devices and components, protocols and services
    
      - Monitor connectivity with network tracing
    
      - Customize your own monitoring workbench to meet your needs

  - RESTful API provides access to data for use in third-party analytic
    tools

  - NetQ Appliance with the NetQ Platform pre-installed to speed
    deployment and get monitoring as quickly as possible

  - Several CLI improvements have been made. To view all changes, refer
    to the CLI user guide.
    
      - Instead of using the `netq show` commands to display changes
        between two points in time, a new `netq show events` command is
        available to see these changes.
    
      - The `netq config ts` commands used to configure the Telemetry
        Server has been deprecated. `netq config` commands remain for
        local file-based configuration and `netq notification` commands
        have been added for configuring event notifications.
    
      - Timestamps which indicate when a change occurred are displayed
        as an absolute time (Mon Feb 4 07:23:18 2019) versus relative to
        the current time (0d:2h:58m:34s ago). Uptimes remain relative to
        the current time.

Features supported in Cumulus NetQ 1.4.1 and earlier continue to be
supported, with the following exceptions:

  - The early access features provided with NetQ 1.4 that were not fully
    productized are not available with this release.
    
      - Extension of NetQ CLI with custom commands
    
      - NetQL, query language for directly accessing the database. This
        data will be available through the NetQ UI or API over time.
    
      - Export of interface statistics to third-party analytics tools
        (like Grafana). This data will be available through the NetQ UI
        or API over time.
    
      - Image and Provisioning Management (IPM) application. Life cycle
        management is in development for a future release.

  - Support for Docker and Docker Swarm. Use Kubernetes to manage
    containers instead.

  - `netq-shell` command. A subset of NetQ commands had to be run on the
    Telemetry Server. Commands that ran on the Telemetry Server have
    been removed and the replacement commands can be run from any node.

  - Service Console. Web-based UI access to the CLI is not currently
    available. Access the CLI directly through a terminal window.
