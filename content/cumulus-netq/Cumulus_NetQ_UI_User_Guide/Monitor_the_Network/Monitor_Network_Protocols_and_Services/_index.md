The Network Services card workflows provide a network-wide view into the
routing, link, and virtual network protocols installed in your network.
In this release, you can monitor the network-wide behavior (all
sessions) of the BGP, EVPN, MLAG, and LLDP services. Each protocol has
its own card workflow containing:

  - a small card with an overall status,

  - a medium card displaying key attributes of the protocol,

  - a large card with detailed performance statistics, some with
    additional tabs, and

  - full screen cards displaying attributes of all associated switches,
    sessions, alarms or other relevant data.

Refer to [NetQ User Interface Overview (2.1.0
version)](https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10456402)
for information about navigating the card workflows and performing
common actions.
