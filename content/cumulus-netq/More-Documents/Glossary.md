## Common Cumulus Linux and NetQ Terminology

The following table covers some basic terms used throughout the NetQ
user documentation.

<tr class="header">
<th><p>Term</p></th>
<th><p>Definition</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Agent</p></td>
<td><p>NetQ software that resides on a host server that provides metrics about the host to the NetQ Telemetry Server for network health analysis.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Alarm</p></td>
<td><p>In UI, event with critical severity.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Bridge</p></td>
<td><p>Device that connects two communication networks or network segments. Occurs at OSI Model Layer 2, Data Link Layer.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Clos</p></td>
<td><p>Multistage circuit switching network used by the telecommunications industry, first formalized by Charles Clos in 1952.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Device</p></td>
<td><p>UI term referring to a switch, host, or chassis or combination of these. Typically used when describing hardware and components versus a software or network topology. See also Node.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Event</p></td>
<td><p>Change or occurrence in network or component; may or may not trigger a notification. In the NetQ UI, there are two types of events: Alarms which indicate a critical severity event, and Info which indicate warning, informational, and debugging severity events.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Fabric</p></td>
<td><p>Network topology where a set of network nodes is interconnected through one or more network switches.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Fresh</p></td>
<td><p>Node that has been heard from in the last 90 seconds.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Software used to provide a high percentage of uptime (running and available) for network devices.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td><p>Software which creates and runs Virtual Machines. Also called a Virtual Machine Monitor.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Info</p></td>
<td><p>In UI, event with warning, informational, or debugging severity.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>IP Address</p></td>
<td><p>An Internet Protocol address is comprised of a series of numbers assigned to a network device to uniquely identify it on a given network. Version 4 addresses are 32 bits and written in dotted decimal notation with 8-bit binary numbers separated by decimal points. Example: 10.10.10.255. Version 6 addresses are 128 bits and written in 16-bit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons. Example: 2018:3468:1B5F::6482:D673.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Leaf</p></td>
<td><p>An access layer switch in a Spine-Leaf or Clos topology. An Exit-Leaf is switch that connects to services outside of the Data Center such as firewalls, load balancers, and Internet routers.</p>
<p>See also Spine, CLOS, Top of Rack and Access Switch.</p></td>
