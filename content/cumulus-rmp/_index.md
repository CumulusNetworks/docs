## Introducing Cumulus RMP

Cumulus RMP is a network operating system in a ready-to-deploy solution
that enables out-of-band management for web-scale networks. It provides
an open platform for customers and system integrators to use as is or on
which to build rack management applications.

Cumulus RMP shares the same architecture, foundation, and user
experience with Cumulus Linux. However, the feature set is customized to
the needs of out-of-band management. For a comparison of the features
supported in Cumulus RMP, [see below](#cumulus-rmp-features-span).

## Setting up a Cumulus RMP Switch

The [quick start guide](/cumulus-rmp/Quick-Start-Guide) walks you
through the steps necessary for getting your Cumulus RMP switch up and
running after you remove it from the box.

## Caveats and Errata

### Dynamic MAC Address Learning Delays

On Cumulus RMP switches, during an STP topology change or an interface flap, the following symptoms could be observed:

- A dynamic MAC address learned on the switch can take a long time to get
  populated back into the kernel, even though the MAC address has already been
  updated in hardware.
- The update of MAC learning can take a much longer time than expected, causing
  the MAC address to point to the wrong interface in hardware and not show up in
  the kernel, which leads to traffic disruption.

These symptoms have only been observed on Cumulus RMP switches; Cumulus RMP is meant to be used for out-of-band management purposes. Other platforms do not
exhibit this issue.
