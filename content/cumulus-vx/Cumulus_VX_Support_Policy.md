As a Cumulus Linux customer, you can now receive formal GSS support for
Cumulus VX instances used to:

  - Test and stage network topologies before deploying to production.

  - Analyze, troubleshoot, and correct issues with configurations and
    software bugs in Cumulus VX that might also apply to Cumulus Linux
    running on physical devices.

  - Analyze, troubleshoot, and correct issues with Cumulus VX if
    behaving differently than physical devices.
    
    {{%notice note%}}
    
    This does not apply in scenarios where it is not possible to emulate
    physical hardware with virtualization.

Cumulus Networks does *not* provide support for the following:

  - Cumulus VX instances used in a production environment.

  - Virtualization environments, including installation, setup, and
    configuration.

  - Automation tool playbooks, including creation and troubleshooting.

  - Performance or scalability issues related to network traffic running
    through Cumulus VX instances.

For non-customers, Cumulus VX remains a community-supported product,
with no formal support obligations from Cumulus Networks. You can submit
questions to the [Cumulus Networks community
forums](https://forums.cumulusnetworks.com) (hosted and moderated by
Cumulus Networks) or to the [community Slack
channel](https://slack.cumulusnetworks.com/) to engage with the forums
and wider community.
