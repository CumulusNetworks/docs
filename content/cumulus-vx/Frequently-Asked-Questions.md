### Why do I see the error br0: received package on swp1 with own address as source address?
<!-- vale on -->

If you intend to bridge the switch ports in the VM, place each switch port in the bridge in its own virtual network on the host. Otherwise, you might see this error:

```
br0: received package on swp1 with own address as source address
```
