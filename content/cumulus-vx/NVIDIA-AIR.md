NVIDIA Air is a cloud hosted, network simulation platform that behaves exactly like a real world production environment. Use NVIDIA Air to create a digital twin of your IT infrastructure so that you can:

- Run full scale network architectures with multiple network operating systems.
- Validate configurations, features, and automation code.

You can access NVIDIA Air {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/air/" text="here">}} and reference the {{<exlink url="https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/nvidia-air/" text="NVIDIA Air User Guide">}} for help.

To get a jumpstart on your network configuration, you can go to the {{<exlink url="https://air.nvidia.com/marketplace" text="Demo Marketplace">}} and run one of the pre-built feature demos, such as EVPN symmetric routing, EVPN centralized routing, EVPN multihoming, and more.
