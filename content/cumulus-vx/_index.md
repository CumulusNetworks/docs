Cumulus VX is a free virtual environment designed for cloud and network
administrators that introduces you to open networking and lets you learn
and test the latest technology from Cumulus Networks in your own time,
at your own pace, and within your own environment without organizational
and economic barriers. Use Cumulus VX to produce sandbox environments
for prototype assessment, pre-production rollouts, and script
development.

## About the Virtual Machine

Cumulus VX runs in a virtual machine (VM) on a standard x86 environment.
The VM is a 64-bit operating system, built on the same foundation as
[Cumulus Linux](/cumulus-linux), running Debian Linux Jessie 4.1, using `virtio`
drivers for network and HDD interfaces as well as the logical volume manager (LVM).

Five versions of the virtual disk image are available for use across
various hypervisors:

- An OVA disk image for use with VirtualBox.
- A VMware-specific OVA disk image.
- A qcow2 disk image for use with KVM.
- A Box image for use with Vagrant.
- A binary image for ONIE installations.

Cumulus VX integrates with the following hypervisors:

- VMware
  - vSphere - ESXi 5.5
  - VMware Fusion
  - VMware Workstation
- VirtualBox

In addition, you can use Cumulus VX with the following development environments:
