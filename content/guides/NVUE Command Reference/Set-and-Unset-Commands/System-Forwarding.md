## nv set system forwarding ecmp-hash gtp-teid

Turns ECMP hashing on the GTP TEID field on or off. The default setting is `off`.

GTP TEID-based ECMP hashing is only applicable if the outer header egressing the port is GTP encapsulated and if the ingress packet is either a GTP-U packet or a VXLAN encapsulated GTP-U packet.

{{%notice note%}}
- Cumulus Linux supports GTP Hashing on NVIDIA Spectrum-2 and later.
- GTP-C packets are not part of GTP hashing.

## nv set system forwarding hash-seed

Configures a unique hash seed for each switch to prevent hash polarization, a type of network congestion that occurs when multiple data flows try to reach a switch using the same switch ports.

You can set a hash seed value between 0 and 4294967295. If you do not specify a value, `switchd` creates a randomly generated seed.

### Version History

Introduced in Cumulus Linux 5.2.0

### Example

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv set system forwarding hash-seed 50
```

- - -

## nv set system forwarding host-route-preference

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv set system forwarding host-route-preference neighbour
```

- - -

## nv set system forwarding lag-hash

Configures custom hashing to load balance between multiple interfaces that are members of the same bond.

The switch distributes egress traffic through a bond to a slave based on a packet hash calculation, providing load balancing over the slaves; the switch distributes conversation flows over all available slaves to load balance the total traffic. Traffic for a single conversation flow always hashes to the same slave. In a failover event, the switch adjusts the hash calculation to steer traffic over available slaves.

- - -

## nv set system forwarding lag-hash destination-ip

Turns lag hashing on the destination IP address field on or off. The default setting is `off`.

### Version History

Introduced in Cumulus Linux 5.2.0

cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv set system forwarding lag-hash destination-ip on
```

- - -

## nv set system forwarding lag-hash destination-mac

cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv set system forwarding lag-hash destination-mac on
```

- - -

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv set system forwarding lag-hash ether-type on
```

- - -

## nv set system forwarding lag-hash gtp-teid

Turns lag hashing on the GTP TEID field on or off. GTP carries mobile data within the core of the mobile operatorâ€™s network. Traffic in the 5G Mobility core cluster, from cell sites to compute nodes, have the same source and destination IP address. The only way to identify individual flows is with the GTP TEID. Enabling GTP hashing adds the TEID as a hash parameter and helps the Cumulus Linux switches in the network to distribute mobile data traffic evenly across ECMP routes.

The default setting is `off`.

### Example

```
cumulus@leaf01:mgmt:~$ nv set system forwarding lag-hash gtp-teid on
```

- - -
