## This Solution Guide is Based on the Following Reference Design

### Topology

{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/ref.topo.png" caption="Ref Solution">}}

### Physical Devices 

In reference topology we used the following hardware:
- 2 x Nvidia Spectrum SN2410 (48x25G+8x100G)
- 2 x Nvidia Spectrum SN2010 (18x25G+4x100G)
- 4 x Nvidia Spectrum SN2700 (32x100G)
- 4 x ESXi Hypervisors (2x25G NIC)
- 1 x Bare Metal Server (2x100G NIC)

### Software

In reference topology we used the following software versions:
- Cumulus Linux 3.7.12
- VMware vCenter 7.0
- VMware NSX-T 2.5
- Apstra AOS 3.3.0
- Ubuntu 18.4 (bare-metal server)

### Racks

The reference topology we used is built of three racks:
- **Rack 1** – Two SN2410 in MLAG + 2 ESXi Hypervisors connected in Active/Active (LACP) bonding (2x25G)
- **Rack 2** – Two SN2010 in MLAG + 2 ESXi Hypervisors connected in Active/Active (LACP) bonding (2x25G)
- **Rack 3** – Two SN2700 in MLAG + Bare-Metal server connected in Active/Active (LACP) bonding (2x100G)
  
All interconnect is done with 2xSN2700 spine switches.

### Physical Connectivity 

The connectivity based on initial LLDP information. After Apstra AOS configuration (or PRA), some of the LLDP information may differ.

## Netowrk Configuration Automation using Apstra AOS

### Step 1 - Create Logical Devices

Networks can be designed in AOS before considering hardware vendors by using logical devices (abstractions of physical devices) to specify common device form factors such as number, speeds, and roles of each port in one or more rack units (panels).<br />In our case, we are using custom logical devices that were designed to perfectly match our custom reference topology, but you can find a lot of predefined logical devices that can suit your needs.

Go to **Logical Devices** tab in the **Design** category
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/1-Logical_devices.JPG">}}
Press on the **Create Logical Device** button
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/1.1-create_logical_devic.JPG">}}
In the opened window, fill the following parameters:
- Logical Device name
- Create device's panel ports count
- Define ports speeds and destiny (which devices types they can be connected to) 

Below is an example of Logical Device matching to Nvidia Mellanox MSN2010 switch with 18x25Gbps + 4x100Gbps ports.<br /> 
The first panel consists of 18 ports SFP25 (25Gbps) and destined to connect to the L2/L3 server or an external router (won’t be used in this reference topology).
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/1.2-create logical device panel1.JPG">}}
The second panel consists of 4 QSFP28 ports (100Gbps) and destined to connect to the Peer switch for MLAG, spine switches, and external router (again, it’s optional).
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/1.2-create logical device panel2.JPG">}}
After all panel ports set, review them, and press **Create** to create the Logical device.
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/1.3-create logical device.JPG">}}
Repeat those actions to create the needed Logical Devices for the reference topology.<br />Once done, you can check out your custom devices by searching for them in the Logical Devices list (or for any other predefined logical device)
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/1.5-create the models as you need.JPG">}}

{{%notice note%}}In our reference topology, for each of our servers, we created custom Logical Devices: 
- ESXi with 2x25Gbps ports 
- Bare-metal server with 2x100Gbps ports 
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/1.6-custom servers logical devices for this solution.JPG">}}{{%/notice%}}

### Step 2 - Create Interfaces Maps

Interface maps consist of interfaces used for achieving the intended network configuration rendering. They map interfaces between logical devices and physical hardware devices (represented with device profiles) while adhering to vendor specifications. Nvidia Mellanox switches profiles for MSN2010, MSN2100, MSN2410, and MSN2700 are predefined in AOS, so no need to create them. 
If your environment consists of newer NVIDIA switche models (e.g., SN3xxx or SN4xxx series ), create them in **Devices/Device Profiles** by following AOS UM.

Go to **Interfaces Maps** tab in the **Design** category
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/2-interface map.JPG">}}
Press on **Create Interfaces Map** button
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/2.1-create interface map.JPG">}}
In the opened window, fill Interface Map’s **Name** and select the needed **Logical Device** and **Profile**. We created custom Logical Devices in the previous step, the profiles for them are predefined in Apstra AOS. As mentioned, custom Device Profiles can be created in **Devices/Device Profiles**.<br />
Press on **Select Interfaces** near each of the port types and select the amounts. Once done, press **Create** to create and map the interfaces to the logical devices
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/2.2-fill interface map info and select ports.JPG">}}
Here are all our created reference topology interfaces maps
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/2.3-after all needed interafces maps created.JPG">}}

### Step 3 - Create Rack Types

Rack Types are standard build patterns that define the type and number of leaf switch network devices and servers for a rack build. There are predefined rack types in AOS, and you can also create, clone, edit, and delete them.<br />
For our reference topology, we will create a new Rack Types to match each of our custom racks designs.

Go to the **Rack Types** tab in the **Design** category
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3-rack type.jpg">}}
Press on the **Create Rack Type** button
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3.1-create rack type.JPG">}}
In the opened window, fill Rack Type’s name and connectivity type (L2/L3).
{{%notice note%}} In our reference topology, we are using L2 MLAG connections on the TOR switches, so we selected L2 connectivity type.{{%/notice %}}
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3.2-rack creation1.JPG">}}

In the **Leaf** tab, fill the following parameters: 
- Name
- Logical Device
- Number of Uplink ports and their speeds
- Redundancy Protocol (MLAG) and its parameters: 
    - Peer-Link (ISL) ports and speed
    - ISL Port-Channel number
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3.2-rack creation2.JPG">}}

Go to the **Server** tab to connect the server to the leaf switches and fill the following parameters:
- Name
- Amount
- Port-Channel ID (in our case it will be MLAG Port-Channel)
- Logical device (we created custom logical devices for our ESXi and bare-metal server earlier)
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3.2-rack creation3-server.JPG">}}

Add links to the server by pressing **Add link** button. 
In the opened section, set the following parameters:
- Link’s name 
- Switch (in our case, we have only one leaf pair) 
- Dual-Homed attachment type
- Active LACP LAG mode
- Physical link count per switch
- Links speed (this automatically taken from the logical device of the server)
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3.2-rack creation3-server-links.JPG">}}

Following the same steps, add the second ESXi hypervisor link (with MLAG Port 2) to the rack

Once done, preview the created Rack Type and press **Create** to create it
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3.2-rack creation-topology preview and create.JPG">}}
We repeated the same steps to create 3 custom Rack Types for our reference topology.
{{%notice note%}} For the bare-metal server, we used the appropriate logical device we created earlier. {{%/notice %}}
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/3.3-created 3 types for our topo, on BM, use BM server logical device.JPG">}}

### Step 4 - Create Templates

Tere are two Template types in Apstra AOS:
- **Rack-based** templates - Used to build 3-stage Clos networks by defining the rack connectivity from the server to the Top-of-Rack and Spine switches. Each can be different in terms of its connection type L2/L3. 
- **POD-based** templates - Used to build 5-stage Clos networks, essentially combining multiple rack-based templates into one by connecting them with a Super-Spine switches layer.

In our reference topology, we are using a single POD of 3 different racks. So we created three different Rack-based templates. 

Go to the **Templates** tab in the **Design** category 
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/5-templates.JPG">}}
Press on the **Create Template** button
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/5.1-create template.JPG">}}
In the opened window, fill the Template details:
- Name
- Type (as mentioned before, we are using Rack-based templates in our reference topology) 
- Policies:
    - Unique BGP ASN allocation
    - Default Routing Policy
    - MP-BGP EVPN overlay 
    - IPv4 P2P Leaf-Spine links
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/5.2-create template1.JPG">}}
{{%notice note%}}Overlay encapsulation in NSX-T deployments is done by it and uses Geneve protocol. In our case, there is a bare-metal rack as well, so VXLAN encapsulation will be used to connect the virtualized and the physical environments.<br />More details about the different types of NSX-T deployments will be covered later on in this guide.{{%/notice %}}
Select previously created rack types, and the Spine Logical Device (are using 2 Spines in our reference topology)
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/5.3-create template structure.JPG">}}
Preview the topology of the Template and press **Create**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/5.4-create template preview_new.png">}}
You can search for the our newly created template by by querying it from the templates list
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/5.5-search for template.JPG">}}

### Step 5 - Create Device Agents

Devices connected to AOS are managed with Device Agents using Push and Pull methods. AOS provides an integrated Agent installer that automates installation and verification of AOS Agents on network devices.

There are two agent types:
- **Onbox** - Installed on the device itself 
- **Offbox** - Is running on the AOS server-side and communicates with the device through its API 
{{%notice note%}}AOS doesn't support Offbox agent for Cumulus Linux, so for our reference topology we will install Onbox agent on our switches.{{%/notice %}}

Go to **Agents** tab in the **Devices** category
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_5.0-agants.JPG">}}
Press on **Create Onbox Agetn(s)** button
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_5.0-agants create.JPG">}}
Fill the following parameters:
- IP addresses of the switches (range can be used) 
- Devices' credentials 
- Leave the rest of the parameters with their default valuse 
Once done, press **Create**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_5-create agent.JPG">}}
Wait until agents finish installing on the switches
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_5-create agent progress.JPG">}}
Once all agents are installed successfully, **Job State** should show **SUCCESS** on all switches.<br />At this point, the device information will appear (system ID and hostname)
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_5-agent installed.JPG">}}
After the agents are installed on the switches, we need to acknowledge the devices in AOS. <br />
Go to the **Managed Devices** tab under **Devices** category
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_6-managed devices.JPG">}}
Select all devices and press on the **V** icon to acknowledge the devices
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_6-ack devices.JPG">}}
{{%notice note%}}If not all device profiles automatically set, check the needed device, press on the **Pencil** icon, and set **Profile** and **Admin State** to **NORMAL**.<br />
Now, the device will be acknowledged automatically.{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4_6-ack devices full.png">}}{{%/notice %}}

### Step 6 - Create Blueprint

After we assembled all the raw materials from the abstractions, reference design, and inventory elements (logical devices, interfaces maps, rack types, profiles, and templates), the next step is to create a Blueprint for our network.<br /> 
Blueprint pulls everything into your best-practice, validated solution. The blueprint will push the configuration into the infrastructure and monitor for state changes and anything else that can affect our intent compliance.

Go to the **Blueprints** category
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/6-blueprints.JPG">}}
Press on **Create Blueprint** button
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/6.1-create blueprint.JPG">}}
In the opened window, set the Blueprint’s **Name** and select the topology **Template**.<br /> 
Once selected, the intent preview will be available
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/6.2-create blueprint1.JPG">}}
Preview Blueprint’s toplogy and parameters, press **Create** to create it
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/6.2-create blueprint2.JPG">}}
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/6.2-create blueprint3.JPG">}}
Wait till the Blueprint finishes creating, and it will be available in the Blueprints Dashboard
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/6.3-blueprint dashboard.JPG">}}

### Step 7 - Configure the Blueprint

To configure the network intent, we need to configure the Blueprints parameters. Click on the blueprint’s name to enter it.

The first page is the Blueprint’s Dashboard, which is currently empty as we have no intent configured yet.<br />
Once all Staged configuration is set and committed into the environment, this dashboard will show the network intent, it’s status and changes in real-time.
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7-blueprint status.JPG">}}

To start configuring the network intent, go to the **Staged** tab. In this tab, we have to configure our network’s **Physical** and **Virtual** parameters.
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7.1-staged.JPG">}}

Start with the **Physical** environment configuration. For that, we need to assign **Resource Pools** for the following parameters:
- Spines’ BGP ASN allocation
- Leafs’ BGP ASN allocation 
- Spines’ Loopback IP addresses  
- Leafs’ Loopback IP addresses
- Leaf-Spine P2P LInks IP addresses

To set the above parameters, press on the **Red status indicator** near each of them (one-by-one), and edit them by pressing the **Pencil** icon
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7.2-config1.JPG">}}
Select the desired resource pools, and press on the **Save** button 
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7.2-config2.JPG">}}
{{%notice note%}}It is possible to create custom **Resource Pools** for any of the above parameters (Leaf/Spine BGP ASN, Leaf/Spine Loopbacks, P2P IPs, and VNIs).<br />
To create them, go to **Resources** category and select the needed tab. 
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/4-resource pools (optional).JPG">}}
In this guide, we are using AOS predefined pools so that custom resource pools creation steps won’t be covered. For more information, check out the AOS UM.{{%/notice %}}
After all the resources selected, all status indicators should appear **Green**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7.2-config3.JPG">}}
Set the devices’ **Interfaces Maps** by clicking on the **Device Profiles** icon (2nd one).<br />
Click on each of the Devices’ **Red status indicator**, and press on the **Pencil** icon to select **Device Profile**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7.2-config4.JPG">}}
Select the appropriate **Interface Map** for each switch (can be done for all by select all checkbox).<br />
The **Device Profile** will be automatically set since it was assigned to the **Interfaces Map** earlier in the configuration. Once all set, press **Update Assignment**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7.2-profiles assignemt.png">}}
After all interfaces maps are set, all switches satatus indicators should be **Green**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/7.2-config5.JPG">}}
{{%notice note%}}As we are not managing server configuration, we can leave their interface maps unselected. It's optional.{{%/notice %}}
Assign **System IDs** to the switches. Go to the **Devices** tab by pressing on the middle icon, click on the **Yellow status indicator**, and press on the **Pencil** icon to edit
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/8-system ids.JPG">}}
In the opened window, assign **System ID** for each of the devices. They should be avalible for each one based on the information from the Agents we installed on them earlier. The **Deployment Mode** will be automatically set to **Deploy**. Once all selected, press on the **Update Assignments**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/8.1-set system ids.JPG">}}
All **System IDs** should be set for all the switches<be />
(Server system IDs are not available as no agents were installed on them. Again, this is optional)
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/8.2-system ids complete.png">}}
{{%notice info%}}Before moving on to the **Virtual** environment configuration, we need to ensure that our **Physical Connectivity** (physical cabling) is aligned with our intent. When a blueprint is created, the interface connectivity will be automatically assumed and done by it.<br />
But, not always the cabling is being done after the intent configured in AOS. If this is the case and the cabling already exists, it's possible to update the blueprint default cabling assumption in a few ways.<br />
Go to **Links** under the **Physical** configuration in **Staged** tab
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/9-lldp.JPG">}}
In this output, all the environment links will be displayed according to the AOS assumption.<br />To change the cabling to your own, use the buttons above the table
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/9.1-lldp buttons.png">}}
Using these buttons allows us to upload a custom cabling schema, export or edit the AOS assumed cabling, change links speeds, or refresh the cabling according to the LLDP from the managed switches.<br /> 
In our case, we are using different cabling schema (as presented in the reference topology diagram). So we will update AOS default schema using LLDP information from our switches.<br />
Press on the **Refresh** icon to gather LLDP information from the switches, and once done, press **Update Cabling Map from LLDP**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/9-lldp1.JPG">}}
Review the gathered LLDP information in the opened window, update if needed, and press **Update**
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/9.2-lldp update.png">}}
Now, the LLDP information (environment cabling) is matching the **Staged** AOS configuration
{{<figure src="/images/guides/apstra-nsx/9-lldp match.png">}}
{{%notice note%}}You can clear the LLDP data, and return on these steps if there was a cabling change afterward.{{%/notice %}}
