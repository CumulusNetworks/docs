NVIDIA Air supports the ability to integrate a Netwoirk Continuous Integration (NetCI) pipeline. It provides workflows to onboard production code and have it tested against a digital simulation of the network.

## Scope

* Currently, only Gitlab is supported as the centralized code repository

## Requirements

In order to use the NVIDIA Air Continuous Integration as a Service (CIaaS), the following requirements must be met.

1. Infrastructure as Code
2. Topology of Data Center

### Infrastructure as Code

The configurations and deployment mechanism must be stored in a centralized git repository. Common git repositories include {{<exlink url="https://github.com" text="Github">}} and {{<exlink url="https://gitlab.com" text="Gitlab">}}.

Infrastructure as code can exist in many way. Below are two methods that can be used for implementing a CI solution.

#### Simple IAC

The simplest form of IAC involves backing up and restoring configurations using a centralized configuration repository. Use this publicly available {{<exlink url="https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/features/simple-iac/" text="Simple IAC">}} repository that can be used to backup and restore files. Any changes committed to this repository would result in a pipeline run of the CI workflow.

#### Advanced IAC

 An example of an advanced solution can be obtained through the NVIDIA {{<exlink url="https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle/cumulus_ansible_modules/" text="Production Ready Automation">}}. This code centralizes not only the configuration backup, but it creates a fully comprehensive automation deployment method including data structures, templates and feature-specific tasks.

### Topology of Data Center

There are two methods to build the topology of the data center. For new environments, the Air topology builder tool can be used to create the the topology. For existing environments, using a script to convert existing configurations into a topology file is easier.

#### Topology Builder

This workflow is outlined in more detail in the section labelled {{<link url="Custom-Topology/" text="Build a Custom Topology">}}.

Using the blank canvas, a full topology can be generated using the GUI:

#### Topology From Existing Network

This workflow is outlined in more detail in the section labelled {{<link url="Custom-Topology/" text="Create a Custom Topology from the Production Network">}}.

## Access NetCI

NVIDIA Air's contiuous integration functionality is available via the direct link for {{<exlink url="https://air.nvidia.com/netci/" text="NetCI">}}.

Login by creating a new account.

## Adding a NetCI Workflow

After the first login, the user is presented with the option to launch a wizard to `Get Started`:

### Connect a Repository

Meeting the first requirement of IaC, the user must link to their git repository and provide the NVIDIA Air NetCI platform access to read the repository.

#### Repository URL

The repository URL is the parent level URL directly accessible over the internet.

Examples of this include:

https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle/cumulus_ansible_modules

Ensure that there is no `trailing slash` as it will cause an error from reading the repository.

After the contents are filled out, the output will look as follows:

#### Access Token

The access token must be generated by the repository and can normally be done through the GUI. Below there are two examples of how to generate the token from Gitlab and Github.

##### Gitlab

In Gitlab, after logging in, select `Preferences`:

Then selected Access Tokens:

Then create an Access Token by giving it a name and make sure to select `read_repository` and `api` as the selected scope.

Take the newly generated personal access token and copy it to the appropriate field in the NVIDIA Air NetCI text box.


### Add a Network

The network defines the architecture that will be launched in the NVIDIA Air as a simulation and the configuration that will be deployed into the simulation.
