NVIDIA Air supports the ability to collaborate and share simulations with your colleagues in an organization. To join an organization, contact your Organization Administrator or your NVIDIA sales team. If you don't know who your Organization Administrator is, please reach out to citc-support@nvidia.com.

## Working with organizations

Each simulation can optionally be assigned to an organization that you are a member of. All members of the organization can view all of its assigned simulations.

In the simulation list, the **Organizations** column will display which organization the simulation is assigned to.

To assign a simulation to an organization, use the **Organization** dropdown menu from the **Edit Simulation** window.

## Managing an organization

As an Organization Administrator, the organization details page will show a list of current members, their roles, and the resource utilization for all simulations in the organization.

To remove a member select **Remove Member** from the actions menu. Note that removing a member from an organization will move all of their simulations out of the organization as well.

## Deleting an organization

To delete an organization, choose the **Delete** option from the actions menu. **Be careful!** Deleting an organization will also delete all of the simulations and resources assigned to it.
