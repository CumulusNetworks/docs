This quick start provides an easy way to access the NVIDIA Air simulation platform.

## Logging into NVIDIA Air

NVIDIA Air uses the developer forums for account access. When presented with the login page, put in your email address into the box and press `GET STARTED`:

The page will redirect to the NVIDIA forums login page. Sign up or login with an existing account:

## NVIDIA Air Landing Page

After logging in, users will be presented with the landing page of NVIDIA Air:

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/LandingPage.png" >}}

From here there are a few options the users can select.

### Organizations

If you have custom simulations, the `Organizations` dropdown will show different organizations to which each simulation belongs. This is not common and will normally be associated with working directly with an NVIDIA Solutions Architect to set up a custom topology.

### Search Simulations

If you have more than one simulation, the search box can help filter your simulations based on a text match.

### Build a Simulation

The details of the Demos are covered in more detail in the section {{<link text="Pre Built Demos" title="Pre Built Demos" >}}

To build a simulation, click the `BUILD A SIMULATION` button in the middle of the screen.

This will launch a new window that lets the user select from a list of pre-build demos.

## Simulation View

### Basic View

The basic view of the simulation allows users to click on the nodes in the topology image to launch a console to each specific node.

Clicking on the node launches a console:

### Advanced View

The advanced view has 4 different panes:
1. Guided Tour
2. Console
3. Nodes
4. Services

## Managing a Simulation

From the main Air landing page, you can manage simulations. There are three options for each public simulation:

1. Power On/Off
2. Rebuild
3. Delete

The `Power On/Off` and `Rebuild` functions are both under the power icon. `Power On/Off` function either wakes the simulation up or puts it to sleep. The `Rebuild` option resets the simulation to a factory default setting. This is useful if you've made lots of changes to the simulation and it is no longer in a desireable state. Using `Rebuild` will reset the simulation to a known base state.
