This quick start provides an easy way to access the NVIDIA Air simulation platform.

## Logging into NVIDIA Air

NVIDIA Air uses the developer forums for account access. When presented with the login page, put in your email address into the box and press `GET STARTED`:

## NVIDIA Air Landing Page

After logging in, users will be presented with the landing page of NVIDIA Air:

From here there are a few options the users can select.

### Organizations

If you have custom simulations, the `Organizations` dropdown will show differen organizations to which each simulation belongs. This is not common and will normally be associated with working directly with an NVIDIA Solutions Architect to set up a custom topology.

### Search Simulations

If you have more than one simulation, the search box can help filter your simulations based on a text match.

### Build a Simulation

The details of the Demos are covered in more detail in the section {{<link text="Pre Built Demos" title="Pre Built Demos" >}}

To build a simulation, click the `BUILD A SIMULATION` button in the middle of the screen.

This will launch a new window that lets the user select from a list of pre-build demos.
