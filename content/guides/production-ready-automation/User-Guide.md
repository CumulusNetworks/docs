This section discusses how you can run the Cumulus Production Ready Automation unmodified on your own system in your enterprise. You can test, learn, and experience Cumulus Linux driven by best practice Ansible automation, and test drive the officially-supported golden standard configurations and architecture.

For more details about how to customize, reuse, and adapt these examples of simulation, automation, or CI/CD for your own purposes, refer to {{<link title="Customize Production Ready Automation" text="Customize Production Ready Automation">}}.

## System Requirements

For a robust simulation environment and CI/CD with GitLab, a dedicated, always-on, enterprise class server is recommended.

{{%notice note%}}

Using the NetQ server in individual development environments is not typically required and is only needed for CI testing where the GitLab Runner is installed and registered to your CI/CD-enabled project.

{{%/notice%}}

### Hardware Requirements

- A minimum of 16GB RAM (without NetQ) - 32GB RAM recommended
- A minimum 256GB disk - more than 1TB disk recommended
- SSD recommended (NetQ requirement)
- Internet connectivity for package installs during simulation start up
- A minimum of eight CPU Cores
- 15104MB of memory *without* NetQ or 23296MB of memory *with* NetQ

### Software Requirements

- Operating systems:
  - Cumulus Linux 3.7.11 or later
  - Cumulus NetQ 2.4 or later (optional)
  - Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 (Cumulus Networks has *not* tested other Linux distributions)
- Software packages:
  - Vagrant 2.2.4 or later
  - Libvirt
  - Qemu
  - Git
- Vagrant plugins:
  - Vagrant-libvirt
  - Vagrant-scp

Refer to the {{<link title="Example Install Scripts" text="Example Install Scripts">}} for an example bash script that installs these package dependencies to support Cumulus VX simulation with Vagrant and libvirt.

## Manually Start a Golden Standard Topology

The {{<link url="Quick-Start" text="Quick Start section">}} provides the easiest way to start a Production Ready Automation demo using a bash script. However, if you want more control over which nodes start and in which order, you can launch the simulation manually. This method saves CPU and memory resources.

To manually start a golden standard demo topology, such as {{<exlink url="https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym" text="EVPN Symmetric Mode">}}, make sure you also fetch and pull down the included Cumulus Linux base reference topology. You can do this in one of two ways:

- Use the `--recurse-submodule` option with the initial `git clone` to fetch the submodule files in the same step as the clone. This option is used in the procedure below.
- Perform a normal `git clone`, then fetch the submodule files separately with the `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` options. For more information about Git submodules, see {{<exlink url="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules" text="this guide">}}.

When the submodule files download correctly, the `cldemo2` folder contains a subfolder called `simulation`. This `simulation` folder contains the `Vagrantfile`. Using `vagrant` commands like `vagrant ssh oob-mgmt-server` are only valid when you run them from the same directory as the simulationâ€™s `Vagrantfile`.

To start a golden standard topology manually:

1. Download a golden standard automation demo, such as EVPN Symmetric Mode. Use the `--recurse-submodule` option to make sure Git also fetches the base Cumulus Networks reference topology simulation files.

   ```
   user@host:~# git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym.git

   Submodule path 'cldemo2': checked out '214c8a66e3fef8f6d5d2b1e13ca3942e4cfd120f'
   ```

2. Change to the folder created by the previous step, then into the `cldemo2/simulation` subfolder. This is the directory where the `Vagrantfile` is present and where `vagrant` commands are valid for this simulation.

   ```
   user@host:~# cd dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation/
   user@host:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation#
   ```

3. Run the `vagrant up` command for the out-of-band management devices.

   If you do not intend to use NetQ, omit `netq-ts` to save CPU and memory resource consumption.

   {{%notice info%}}

You must start the oob-mgmt-server and oob-mgmt-switch first. The oob-mgmt-server acts as the management network DHCP server. If the oob-mgmt-server and switch are not online first, the management interfaces of the other network devices will be unreachable temporarily.

{{%/notice%}}

   ```
   user@host:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation# vagrant up oob-mgmt-server oob-mgmt-switch netq-ts
   Bringing machine 'oob-mgmt-server' up with 'libvirt' provider...
   Bringing machine 'oob-mgmt-switch' up with 'libvirt' provider...
   Bringing machine 'netq-ts' up with 'libvirt' provider...
   ==> oob-mgmt-server: Checking if box 'generic/ubuntu1804' version '2.0.6' is up to date...
   ==> oob-mgmt-switch: Checking if box 'CumulusCommunity/cumulus-vx' version '3.7.11' is up to date...
   ==> netq-ts: Checking if box 'generic/ubuntu1804' version '2.0.6' is up to date...
   <output omitted for brevity>
   ```

4. Run the `vagrant up` command to start up the other network devices. You can start up all the remaining nodes in the simulation with the `vagrant up` command (with no specific devices specified). 

   Vagrant for libvirt tries to start devices in parallel. Occasionally, starting an entire reference topology simulation in parallel can cause errors that result in a partial or incomplete startup process. Cumulus Networks recommends you start the simulation in smaller, more manageable groups. The example below starts the simulation in four separate stages. Each stage separated by `&&` is executed alone. The example combines those serialized stages in one line.

   {{%notice tip%}}

The `&&` operator in Linux only executes the next command if the previous command is successful. If an error occurs, the simulation start up process stops.

{{%/notice%}}

   ```
   user@host:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation# vagrant up /leaf/ /spine/ && vagrant up server01 server02 server03 server04 && vagrant up server05 server06 server07 server08 && vagrant up border01 border02 fw1 fw2
   ```

5. Enter the simulation from the oob-mgmt-server with the `vagrant ssh oob-mgmt-server` command:

   ```
   user@host:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation# vagrant ssh oob-mgmt-server
                                                    _

   vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$
   ```

6. Run another `git clone` from your target golden standard demo project (refer to step 1) from inside the simulation to fetch the automation files. Alternatively, you can run `vagrant scp` to copy the automation files into the simulation.

   ```
   vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$ git clone https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym
   Cloning into 'dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym'...
   warning: redirecting to https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym.git/

   Resolving deltas: 100% (214/214), done.
   vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$
   ```

7. Change to the project folder, then to the `automation` subfolder:

   ```
   vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$ cd dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/automation/
   vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/automation$
   ```

8. Run the `deploy.yml` playbook and specify the inventory path with the `-i` option:

   ```
   vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/automation$ ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventories/pod1 --diff

## Automatically Run Production Ready Automation in Cumulus in the Cloud

This method is the easiest way to experience the final product of the Cumulus golden standard EVPN VXLAN demo configurations. This method is best suited to fast track all the simulation setup and provisioning, and start testing any of the official golden standard EVPN-VXLAN demo configurations.

If you are interested in taking a closer look at the automation and deployment processes, and see the actual examples of the infrastructure as code, you need to clone the demo project and manually run the automation playbook to render the configuration as code into the network devices. This automated process clones your selected demo repository and runs the Ansible deployment playbook for you with a few easy and convenient clicks from Cumulus in the Cloud UI.

1. Go to {{<exlink url="https://www.cumulusnetworks.com/citc" text="Cumulus in the Cloud">}} to request a demo or to reach your existing simulation.
2. After you reach your simulation console, choose a demo from the dropdown menu on the left panel.

    {{<img src="/images/guides/citc-interface-demo.png" >}}

3. Click **Run Now**.
4. Follow the instructions on the `Guided Tour` panel to test and experience the unique aspects of your selected demo.

## Manually Run the Automation Demo from Cumulus in the Cloud

{{<exlink url="https://www.cumulusnetworks.com/citc" text="Cumulus in the Cloud">}} provides the fastest way to enjoy the experience of provisioning a full data center using best practice Ansible automation and see a working example of infrastructure as code. By removing the complexity of the simulation hardware and software dependencies, you can be in the driverâ€™s seat of a fully provisioned data center to test the automation experience and any of the demo solution architectures in minutes. Cumulus in the Cloud also includes a free temporary NetQ Cloud account to showcase the NetQ features with live data from your simulation.

1. Start from the `oob-mgmt-server` in your Cumulus in the Cloud simulation. For the best experience, use an SSH client to connect. Find the SSH client connection information from the **Services** window in the UI.

    {{<img src="/images/guides/citc-interface-services.png" >}}

2. From your target golden standard demo project, run the `git clone` command:

    ```

## Install and Configure the NetQ Cloud Server

The Cumulus Networks reference topology includes an Ubuntu 18.04 server with additional CPU, memory, and disk resources to support a NetQ Cloud Server installation. Vagrant provisions this box with all the required software package dependencies to be able to go immediately to the bootstrap and install steps of the NetQ server setup documented in the {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq-30/Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Install-NetQ/Install-NetQ-System-Platform/Prepare-Existing-NetQ-Appliance/" text="NetQ Deployment Guide" >}}.

To use the included NetQ Cloud server, the following is required:

- An active NetQ Cloud account with {{<exlink url="https://netq.cumulusnetworks.com" text="netq.cumulusnetworks.com" >}}.
- An additional site that is set up and provisioned, and dedicated for virtualization use (a unique NetQ configuration key for your simulation environment). Do not mix a simulation topology with an existing site or use an existing and in-use NetQ premises configuration key.
- The NetQ bootstrap tarball downloaded from {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/" text="cumulusnetworks.com" >}}.
- The NetQ OPTA install tarball downloaded from {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/" text="cumulusnetworks.com" >}}.

{{%notice info%}}

The NetQ bootstrap and NetQ OPTA install tarballs are two unique files.

{{%/notice%}}

### Stage the NetQ Installation Tarballs

The NetQ application and version is driven by the version of the bootstrap and install files used to install the NetQ application on the provided Ubuntu server. The installation procedure uses the NetQ agent that is preinstalled on the Cumulus NetQ Cloud virtual appliance (netq-ts). You must stage the NetQ bootstrap and install the tarball files that are downloaded from cumulusnetworks.com for the NetQ installation procedure.

You can stage the installation tarballs in either one of two locations:

- On the local filesystem of netq-ts.

   **After** you start the simulation with `vagrant up`, copy the bootstrap and installation tarballs onto netq-ts (with `scp` or `vagrant scp`).

- On a remote HTTP server reachable by netq-ts.

   Place the bootstrap and installation tarballs onto an HTTP server. An HTTP URL is provided during the bootstrap and installation procedures.

   You must decide whether to stage the installation tarball files directly onto the server for installation, or host them on a remote HTTP server that netq-ts can reach.

   When downloaded from cumulusnetworks.com, the installation tarball files are called:

    - `netq-bootstrap-X.Y.Z.tgz` (bootstrap tarball)
    - `NetQ-X.Y.Z-opta.tgz` (install tarball)

    {{%notice info%}}

The `netq-bootstrap` and `netq-opta` image version numbers must match.

{{%/notice%}}

#### Stage from the Local Filesystem

For specific steps on how to log into cumulusnetworks.com and download the NetQ files, refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq-30/Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Install-NetQ/Install-NetQ-System-Platform/Prepare-Existing-NetQ-Appliance/" text="Download the bootstrap and NetQ installation tarballs" >}} in the NetQ documentation. Use SCP to copy the files onto the Linux-based simulation host securely.

The following procedure shows you how to copy the installation tarball files to the `/mnt/installables` directory (any directory that has sufficient read permissions is suitable for staging these files). Repeat the following steps for each file:

1. Download these two required installation files from cumulusnetworks.com:
    - Bootstrap
    - Appliance (Cloud)
2. Move or copy the files onto the simulation host. SCP is most commonly used to push files onto the Linux-based simulation host.
3. To copy the file from the simulation host to the simulation on netq-ts, run the `vagrant scp` command. The `vagrant scp` plugin uses `vagrant ssh` and is subject to the permissions of the `vagrant` user account. Copy files to a path where the `vagrant` user has permissions, such as `/home/cumulus/`.

   Make sure you run the `vagrant scp` command from inside the `simulation` folder (where the `Vagrantfile` for the simulation exists).

    ```
    user@simulation-host:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation# vagrant scp /path/to/local/file/netq-boostrap-X.Y.Z.tgz netq-ts:/home/cumulus

    user@simulation-host:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation# vagrant scp /path/to/local/file/NetQ-X.Y.Z-opta.tgz netq-ts:/home/cumulus
    ```

5. Run `vagrant ssh` into netq-ts, then move the files to the `/mnt/installables` directory:

    ```
    user@host:~/dc_configs_vxlan_evpnsym/cldemo2/simulation# vagrant ssh netq-ts
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$ sudo mv /home/cumulus/netq-boostrap-X.Y.Z.tgz /mnt/installables/
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$ sudo mv /home/cumulus/NetQ-X.Y.Z.tgz /mnt/installables/
    ```

#### Stage from a Remote HTTP Server

For specific steps on how to log into cumulusnetworks.com and download the NetQ files, refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq-30/Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Install-NetQ/Install-NetQ-System-Platform/Prepare-Existing-NetQ-Appliance/" text="Download the bootstrap and NetQ installation tarballs" >}} in the NetQ documentation. Specific steps on how to copy the tarballs onto a remote HTTP server vary depending on the specific HTTP server software. This following example shows you how to set up an HTTP server with Apache on a Debian- or Ubuntu-based Linux system.

1. Download these two required installation files from cumulusnetworks.com:
    - Bootstrap
    - Appliance (Cloud)
2. Install Apache2.
3. Confirm the services are running.
4. Copy the tarball files to the `/var/www/html` directory (with permissions).
5. Derive HTTP staging URLs for the next steps.

### Install the NetQ Application

This process installs the NetQ Cloud server application to be able to receive and aggregate agent data, and transport the data securely to the cloud associated with your account.

- You must stage the bootstrap and install tarball files in either the local filesystem on netq-ts or on a remote HTTP server accessible from netq-ts. See the {{<link text="previous section" title="#Stage the NetQ Installation Tarballs" >}} for instructions.
- The NetQ configuration key associated with the NetQ site/premises that this simulation will occupy is required. You receive the key from Cumulus Networks by email as part of NetQ Cloud onboarding.

For more complete information about installing NetQ, refer to the {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq-30/Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Install-NetQ/Install-NetQ-System-Platform/Prepare-Existing-NetQ-Appliance/" text="NetQ documentation" >}}. To complete the NetQ Cloud Server installation in the Cumulus demo topology, follow these steps:

1. Perform the NetQ server bootstrap with the bootstrap tarball.

   - Use `eth0` as the interface identifier.
   - `<URL-path>` is either a local filesystem absolute path or an HTTP server URL starting with `http://`.

    ```
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$  netq bootstrap master interface eth0 tarball <URL-path>/netq-bootstrap-X.Y.Z.tgz
    2020-12-20 01:13:27.207201: master-node-installer: Extracting tarball <URL-path>/netq-bootstrap-X.Y.Z.tgz
    2019-12-20 01:14:44.157670: master-node-installer: Checking package requirements
    2019-12-20 01:15:10.402228: master-node-installer: Using eth0 IP X.X.X.X
    2019-12-20 01:15:10.812041: master-node-installer: Initializing kubernetes cluster
    -----------------------------------------
    Successfully bootstrapped the master node
    ```

    This step takes a few minutes.

2. After the bootstrap step completes, perform the NetQ application install with the `-opta.tgz` bundle.

   - Use the configuration key for your NetQ Cloud premises.
   - `<URL-path>` is either a local filesystem absolute path or an HTTP server URL starting with `http://`.

    ```
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$ netq install opta standalone full interface eth0 bundle <URL-path>/NetQ-X.Y.Z-opta.tgz config-key <your-config-key>
    2019-12-20  06:28:35.368116: master-node-installer: Installing in standalone mode

    --------------------------------------
    Successfully installed the master node
    ```

### (Optional) Configure the NetQ CLI Agents

The NetQ CLI is a separate daemon that is configured independently from the NetQ agent data collection and telemetry streaming daemon. To fully complete the NetQ installation in your demo environment, you must also configure and install the CLI on all devices where you want to run the `netq` CLI commands. In most deployments, this is also configured with every agent so that you can obtain all NetQ data from any device in the network.

You must have a set of authorization keys generated for a NetQ user (access-key and secret-key). Refer to {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq-30/Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Install-NetQ/Install-NetQ-CLI/Install-NetQ-CLI-on-CL/" text="Configuring the CLI for Cloud Deployments" >}} in the NetQ documentation to create the keys.

To install the CLI:

1. From devices in simulation that do not use the management VRF (Ubuntu hosts and the NetQ server itself), run the following command:

    ```
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$ netq config add cli server api.netq.cumulusnetworks.com access-key <access-key> secret-key <secret-key> premise <netq-premise-name> port 443
    ```

    From devices in simulation that do use the management VRF (Cumulus Linux nodes, such as leaf, spine, border, and fw), run the following command:

    ```
    cumulus@netq-ts:~$ netq config add cli server api.netq.cumulusnetworks.com access-key <access-key> secret-key <secret-key> premise <netq-premise-name> vrf mgmt port 443
    ```

2. Restart the NetQ CLI daemon:

   ```
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$ netq config restart cli
   ```

3. Test a NetQ CLI command:

   ```
    vagrant@netq-ts:~$ netq show agents
   ```

To deploy the NetQ CLI configuration commands to several devices at the same time, use Ansible ad-hoc commands from the oob-mgmt-server.

The following example shows you how to configure the NetQ CLI on all the Cumulus Linux nodes that use the management VRF:

```
vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$ ansible spine:leaf:exit -a 'netq config add cli server api.netq.cumulusnetworks.com access-key <access-key> secret-key <secret-key> premise <netq-premise-name> vrf mgmt port 443'
vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$ ansible spine:leaf:exit -a 'netq config restart cli'
```

The following example shows you how to configure the NetQ CLI on Ubuntu hosts:

```
vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$ ansible host -a 'netq config add cli server api.netq.cumulusnetworks.com access-key <access-key> secret-key <secret-key> premise <netq-premise-name> vrf mgmt port 443'
vagrant@oob-mgmt-server:~$ ansible host -a 'netq config restart cli'
```

## Clean Up Orphaned Simulations

Occasionally, errors occur when you use Vagrant or when you delete files from a project that is in use.

To clean up stuck or orphaned libvirt simultations:

1. Use the `virsh list --all` command to inspect the system and see all running libvirt simulations. Find the libvirt *domains* that you want to clean up. Simulations often have a common prefix from the same simulation that is normally the parent folder.

2. Run these commands on each virtual machine (libvirt domain) that you want to clean up:
   - `virsh destroy <name>`
   - `virsh undefine <name>`
   - `virsh vol-delete --pool default <name>.img`

To clean up all simulations that match a common pattern, run this script:

```
#for vm in $(virsh list --all | grep <match-pattern> | awk -F ' ' '{print$2}'); do virsh destroy $vm; virsh undefine $vm; virsh vol-delete --pool default $vm.img; done
```

Use this script with caution on servers with other simulations and in shared environments as it does not prompt for confirmation and might delete systems you match accidentally.
