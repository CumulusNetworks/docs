## Issue

I lost my root password. How do I reset the root password in Cumulus Linux?

My switch boots partially, but not far enough for me to log in. How do I gain access the file system to investigate or fix?

## Environment

- Cumulus Linux, all versions

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, [boot into single user mode]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-43/Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/Single-User-Mode-Password-Recovery" >}}) for password recovery.
