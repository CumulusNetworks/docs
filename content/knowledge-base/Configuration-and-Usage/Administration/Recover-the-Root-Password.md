## Issue

I lost my root password. How do I reset the root password in Cumulus Linux?

My switch boots partially, but not far enough for me to log in. How do I gain access the file system to investigate or fix?

## Environment

- Cumulus Linux, all versions

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/Single-User-Mode-Password-Recovery/" text="boot into single user mode">}} for password recovery.
