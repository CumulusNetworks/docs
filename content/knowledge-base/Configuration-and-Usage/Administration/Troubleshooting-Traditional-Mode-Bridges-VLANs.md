This article presents troubleshooting procedures for bridges in traditional mode.

## Bridge Is not Passing Traffic

### Symptoms

- The bridge looks correct (correct ports are in the bridge, and the swps are admin up, physically up),
- But traffic is not passing through the bridge.

### Solution

`brctl` does not show if the bridge is administratively down:

    cumulus@switch:~ $ brctl show br-untagged
    bridge name bridge id       STP enabled interfaces
    bridge      8000.443839003424   no      swp20
                                        swp22
                                        swp23

This bridge looks fine, but is admin down:

    cumulus@switch:~$ ip link show br-untagged
    63: bridge-untagged: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT
        link/ether 44:38:39:00:34:24 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

## Bridge Is not Giving Spanning Tree Output

### Symptoms

- Bridge is up and passing traffic,
- But `mstpctl` is not giving any output on the bridge.

### Solution

No output means that spanning tree is not enabled for that specific bridge.

Example output:

    cumulus@switch:~$ mstpctl showbridge br-untagged
    cumulus@switch:~$

Add `bridge-stp on` under the bridge stanza and `ifup` the bridge. Output now appears when `mstpctl showbridge` command is used:

    cumulus@switch:~$ mstpctl showbridge br-untagged
    bridge CIST info
      enabled         yes
      bridge id       8.000.44:38:39:00:34:24
      designated root 8.000.44:38:39:00:34:24
      regional root   8.000.44:38:39:00:34:24

## Individual Port Is not Forwarding Traffic despite Being up/up

### Symptoms

- `brctl` output looks fine,
- swp is showing up/up,
- But the swp does not forward traffic.

### Solution

Check if spanning tree has disabled ports by using the `mstpctl showport` command:

    cumulus@sw2:~$ mstpctl showport br-untagged
    *  swp17 8.003 down 8.000.44:38:39:00:25:E8 8.000.44:38:39:00:25:E8 0.000 Disa
    *  swp18 8.001 down 8.000.44:38:39:00:25:E8 8.000.44:38:39:00:25:E8 0.000 Disa
       swp19 8.002 forw 8.000.08:9E:01:CE:DC:D2 8.000.08:9E:01:CE:DC:D2 8.002 Root

{{<img src="/images/knowledge-base/tshoot-trad-mode-bridge.png">}}

In the above example, swp17-19 are connected to the same switch and spanning-tree has disabled 2 of the connections as indicated with the "Disa" at the end of each line. This is correct behavior in this scenario. To get all 3 ports working in tandem at the same time, you could bond the ports together to form an LACP EtherChannel.

## You Do not Remember which Port a Device Is Hooked Into

### Symptoms

- Bridge is working correctly,
- And you have the MAC address of the device.

### Solution

Check the MAC address table by using the `brctl showmacs` command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ brctl showmacs br-untagged
    port name mac addr      is local?   ageing timer
    swp19     08:9e:01:ce:dc:d4 no         8.69
    swp17     44:38:39:00:25:e8 yes        0.00
    swp18     44:38:39:00:25:e9 yes        0.00
    swp19     44:38:39:00:25:ea yes        0.00
    cumulus@switch:~$

Now you can see all the MAC addresses (machine specific) and which ports (front panel port) they are tied to. With the above output, only swp19 has a device hooked into it, as indicated by the *no* under *is local?*.

## You Do not Remember which Port a Device Is Hooked up to, or which Bridge

### Symptoms

- Multiple bridges are configured,
- And you have the MAC address of the device.

### Solution

Use the `bridge fdb show` command to see multiple bridges and their associated MAC addresses:

    cumulus@switch:~$ bridge fdb show
    44:38:39:00:25:e8 dev swp17 master br-10 permanent
    08:9e:01:ce:dc:c1 dev swp19 master br-20
    44:38:39:00:25:eb dev swp20 master br-5 permanent
    08:9e:01:ce:dc:d4 dev swp19 master br-20
    44:38:39:00:25:e9 dev swp18 master br-5 permanent
    44:38:39:00:25:ea dev swp19 master br-20 permanent
