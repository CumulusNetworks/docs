The Cumulus Networks {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl" text="Cumulus Linux Hardware Compatibility List">}} (HCL) provides a list of pluggables that are recommended for use with systems running Cumulus Linux. The list includes:

- All {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-express/" text="Cumulus Express">}} components
- Pluggables qualified by Cumulus Networks Engineering

The HCL provides a list of recommended pluggables for each platform. That list identifies the Cumulus Linux versions that support each recommended pluggable. The HCL includes pluggables qualified by Cumulus Networks Engineering.

While Cumulus Networks recommends using the pluggables listed on the HCL, Cumulus Networks also provides {{<link url="Transceiver-and-Cable-Self-qualification-with-Cumulus-Linux" text="this procedure for qualifying a non-recommended pluggable yourself">}}. If you decide to try out a pluggable that Cumulus Networks does not recommend, Cumulus Linux does not actively prevent the pluggable from functioning. Cumulus Networks does not restrict the use of self-qualified pluggables; however, we do not provide support for any issues that arise from a self-qualified pluggable. If you have concerns about a pluggable that is not listed, please contact your Cumulus Networks sales team.
