This article introduces you to monitoring and walks you through configuration of several sFlow visualization tools. You need a Linux-based host to install the collectors below. You can read more about setting up sFlow on your Cumulus Linux switch in the {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/Network-Troubleshooting/Monitoring-System-Statistics-and-Network-Traffic-with-sFlow/" text="user guide">}}.

## Understanding Monitoring

Monitoring can provide important insight into your network. Many tools, both open source and commercial, exist to help you monitor the traffic flowing through your network as well as the performance of your switches and routers. Cumulus Linux, in versions 2.1 and up, supports the Host sFlow protocol. Host sFlow can sample traffic going through your network as well as metrics and counters on the switches, to give a holistic view of your network.  A variety of network gear and system operating systems also {{<exlink url="http://www.sflow.org/products/network.php" text="support sFlow">}}.

There are two important pieces to successfully setting up sFlow:

- Setting up the hosts
- Setting up the collectors

We strongly recommend using a separate server for your sFlow collector, as switches running Cumulus Linux are specialized and do not have the storage and CPU to satisfactorily perform as a collector. Setting up your Cumulus Linux switch to be a collector is described in the {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/Network-Troubleshooting/Monitoring-System-Statistics-and-Network-Traffic-with-sFlow/" text="user guide">}}. Configuring your server to be an sFlow collector is described in the documentation from your server vendor, and some popular setups are described below.

Once your `hsflow` daemon is sending monitoring traffic to your collections server, you can find out some interesting data such as top talkers, interface status, and top flows.

## Popular sFlow Tools

Many popular tools exist for sFlow data. You can find a comprehensive list {{<exlink url="http://www.sflow.org/products/collectors.php" text="here">}}. With so many tools in the wild, choosing one may depend on your organization's existing infrastructure and your goals. Since sFlow can send to multiple collectors, you do not need to limit yourself to one tool.

Two free, very simple open source collectors are {{<exlink url="https://www.wireshark.org/" text="Wireshark">}} and {{<exlink url="http://www.inmon.com/technology/sflowTools.php" text="sflowtool">}}. They are useful for debugging a low bandwidth single flow or for ensuring that your hosts are properly configured and sending sFlow data, but they aren't very human readable.  

Due to the high volume of traffic passing through most switches, a more human readable format is often preferred. Graphs also provide excellent visibility.

Many organizations have existing systems to monitor servers. One of these, {{<link url="Use-Ganglia-with-Cumulus-Linux/" text="Ganglia">}}, can directly ingest sFlow counter samples and display switch metrics directly. {{<exlink url="http://graphite.wikidot.com/" text="Graphite">}}, another popular tool for visualizing system data, can display sFlow data with the {{<exlink url="https://code.google.com/p/sflow2graphite/" text="sflow2graphite script">}}.

Tools that specialize in network traffic also exist for sFlow. These tools can also ingest netflow data, for compatibility with any network gear which does not yet support sFlow. These tools also will show more network specific information such as flow data. Two popular open source projects are {{<exlink url="http://www.pmacct.net/" text="pmacct">}} and {{<exlink url="http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/" text="NfSen">}} (described in more detail below).

Some popular commercial options are {{<exlink url="http://www.inmon.com/products/trafficsentinel.php" text="Traffic Sentinel">}} (described in more detail below), {{<exlink url="http://www.arbornetworks.com/products/peakflow" text="Arbor Peakflow">}} and {{<exlink url="http://www.solarwinds.com/netflow-traffic-analyzer.aspx" text="Solarwinds NetFlow Traffic Analyzer">}}.

## NfSen

{{<exlink url="http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/" text="NfSen">}} is one of the popular open source project which monitors networking data. There was an excellent guide to setting up NfSen, that's {{<exlink url="https://web.archive.org/web/20180827055516/http://terraltech.com/installation-and-configuration-of-nfdump-and-nfsen-on-ubuntu/" text="archived here">}}. There are two or three caveats to this guide. Since we are using sFlow, when compiling `nfdump`, be sure to use the `--enable-sflow` flag. When you set up a source in `nfsen.conf`, it should look like the following:

    %sources = (
        'upstream1'    => { 'port' => '6343', 'col' => '#0000ff', 'type' => 'sflow' },
    );

Notice that the `type` flag is `sflow`, not `netflow`.

If you are installing NfSen on a Debian-based system (like Debian or Ubuntu), you need to add LSB tags to the `init` file. Edit `/etc/init.d/nfsen`, and after the line `#!/usr/bin/perl`, add:

    ### BEGIN INIT INFO
    # Provides:          nfsen
    # Required-Start:    $local_fs $network $syslog
    # Required-Stop:     $local_fs $syslog
    # Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
    # Default-Stop:      0 1 6
    # Short-Description: nfsen
    # Description:       nfsen
    ### END INIT INFO

## Traffic Sentinel

{{<exlink url="http://www.inmon.com/products/trafficsentinel.php" text="Traffic Sentinel">}} is a popular commercial project that bridges both server metrics and network data. This tool can be useful to have all of your monitoring in one location. Install the server on a Linux host using {{<exlink url="https://www.myinmon.com/support/install_instructions_2_2.html" text="these instructions">}} (you must register to access the instructions).
