You can access any switch on the NVIDIA {{<exlink url="www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/hardware-compatibility-list/" text="HCL">}} via the console. The standard command to use for console access depends on your host operating system.

For MacOS:

    screen /dev/cu.usbserial 115200

For Linux:

    picocomm -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0

USB0 can be USB1 or USB2, and so forth.

Most switches on the NVIDIA HCL are set at either 9600 or 115200. This depends on the factory setting.
