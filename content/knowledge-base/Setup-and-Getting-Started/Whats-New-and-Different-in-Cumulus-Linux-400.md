Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 is the biggest update to the operating system in years! This version has many changes, both cosmetic and under the hood, including a new kernel and several new platforms &mdash; but we've also removed some platforms and features &mdash; so it is a good idea for you to understand everything that changed **before** you upgrade.

  - In this kernel, {{<link url="Spectre-and-Meltdown-Vulnerability-Fixes" text="Meltdown/Spectre fixes">}} are all fully up to date
- Capability to `apt-get upgrade` to a specific 4.y.z release, not just the latest version (for use in future Cumulus 4.0.z releases)

- A new [backup and restore utility]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-40/Installation-Management/Back-up-and-Restore" >}})
- [Advertise primary IP address type-5 routes]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-40/Network-Virtualization/Ethernet-Virtual-Private-Network-EVPN/Inter-subnet-Routing#advertise-primary-ip-address" >}}) in an EVPN symmetric configuration in VXLAN active-active mode
- [BGP best path reason]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-40/Layer-3/Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP" >}}) shown in command outputs
- On NVIDIA Spectrum switches, certain [buffer and queue configuration settings]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-40/Layer-1-and-Switch-Ports/Buffer-and-Queue-Management" >}}) no longer require `switchd` restart
- The [FRRouting]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-40/Layer-3/FRRouting-Overview" >}}) `daemons` and `daemons.conf` files have been merged together into the `daemons` file, which may affect your automation scripts
- The NetQ agent and CLI are installed by default in Cumulus Linux; these packages are also present in the `apt.cumulusnetworks.com` repository and are updated as new versions of NetQ become available
- The following files have been added to the Cumulus Linux base image:
  - `bwm-ng`
  - `dos2unix`

  - [MAC learning]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-43/Network-Virtualization/Ethernet-Virtual-Private-Network-EVPN/Basic-Configuration" >}}) is disabled by default on all VXLAN bridge ports
  - On Broadcom switches, the default value for `route_preferred_over_neigh` in `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` is now TRUE
- A [local archive]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-40/Installation-Management/Adding-and-Updating-Packages#add-packages-from-the-cumulus-linux-local-archive" >}}) is now embedded in the Cumulus Linux disk image that contains the packages required to install ifplugd, LDAP, RADIUS or TACACS+ without needing a network connection; the archive is called `cumulus-local-apt-archive` and is referenced in the `/etc/apt/cumulus-local-apt-archive-sources.list` file
