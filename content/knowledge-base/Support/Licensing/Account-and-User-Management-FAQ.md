## One of my colleagues received our order confirmation and I need to access the license file. How can I get it?
<!-- vale on -->
Cumulus Linux 4.3 and earlier uses a generic license. To retrieve the license:
1. Log in to the {{<exlink url="https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/" text="NVIDIA Enterprise support portal">}}.
2. From the **Downloads** tab, click **Switches and Gateways**.
3. Under **Switch Software**, click **All downloads** next to **Cumulus Linux for Mellanox Switches**.
4. Select the current version and the target version, then click the **Show Downloads Path** button.
5. Click on the download icon for the Generic Cumulus License to display the generic license.

If you do not have login access to the portal, contact the license owner at your company and they can create a login for you. If you do not know who owns your company's NVIDIA account, contact your NVIDIA account manager.
