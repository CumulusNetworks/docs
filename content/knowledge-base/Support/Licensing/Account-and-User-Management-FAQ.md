## One of my colleagues received our order confirmation and I need to retrieve the license key. How can I get it?
<!-- vale on -->
Cumulus Linux 4.3 and earlier uses a generic license key to enable the front-panel ports on the Mellanox switch. To retrieve the license key, see {{<link url="/Cumulus-Linux-License-Key" text="Cumulus Linux License Key">}}.

If you do not have login access to the portal, contact the license owner at your company and they can create a login for you. If you do not know who owns your company's NVIDIA account, contact your NVIDIA account manager.
