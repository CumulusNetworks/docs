   (e) you will appoint as designated users only those of your employees who have reasonably appropriate technical backgrounds and skills. You may remove or replace designated users during the service term with notice to NVIDIA; and

   (f) you will appoint, at NVIDIA’s request, designated service, and engineering contacts for service issue escalations NVIDIA shall be excused from performing any of its obligations hereunder to the extent any such non‐performance is attributable to your failure to perform your responsibilities under this section.

5. **Service Fees**; Payment Terms. When you purchase service subscriptions directly from NVIDIA the following applies: Fees
for the service subscriptions are set forth in the associated order and are payable pursuant to the terms of such order which may require the receipt of payment in full prior to the commencement of any services. Unless otherwise expressly indicated in an order, fees will be invoiced upon your purchase, are payable upon invoice and are expressed in U.S. Dollars. All fees are non‐refundable, and don’t include any taxes, duties or similar charges. If NVIDIA is required to pay sales, use, property, valueadded or other taxes based on the payments provided in the service subscriptions and if NVIDIA is required to collect and remit such taxes, then such taxes shall be billed to and paid by you or your reseller, unless NVIDIA receives a valid exemption or resale certificate. If you are not billed the applicable tax under the order, then it is your responsibility to properly remit the tax directly to the applicable tax jurisdiction. Further, you acknowledge that the payments to NVIDIA under the service subscriptions shall be made in full without reduction for withholding taxes, if applicable. This section shall not apply to taxes based on NVIDIA’s net income or payroll taxes. All amounts not paid when due will accrue interest (without the requirement of a notice) at the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permissible by law until the unpaid amounts are paid in full.
