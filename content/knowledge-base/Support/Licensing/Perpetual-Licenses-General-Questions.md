## Cumulus Linux License Key

Cumulus Linux 4.3 and earlier uses a generic license key to enable the front-panel ports on the switch. You use the same license key for all your licensed Cumulus Linux switches. To retrieve the generic license key, see {{<link url="/Cumulus-Linux-License-Key" text="Cumulus Linux License Key">}}.

Cumulus Linux 4.4 and later does **not** require a license key to enable the front-panel ports.

## How can I evaluate Cumulus Linux?
<!-- vale on -->
If you do not have supported hardware, reserve a {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/cumulus-linux-free-trial/" text="Cumulus in the Cloud">}} simulation and try out a test setup in your browser.

If you already have supported hardware, fill out {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/contact/sales/" text="this form">}} and wait for an NVIDIA representative to contact you.

## How is Cumulus Linux licensed?

Cumulus Linux is commercially available through a perpetual license model, giving you the right to use Cumulus Linux for the lifetime of the Open Networking hardware it runs on. <!--NVIDIA provides a generic license, which you can download from the {{<exlink url="https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/" text="NVIDIA Enterprise support portal">}}.-->

## What do I receive when I purchase a Cumulus Linux license?
<!-- vale on -->
Purchasing a Cumulus Linux license gives you right to use Cumulus Linux for the lifetime of the Open Networking hardware on which it runs. Combined with the license, you can purchase a Software Updates and Support contract for 1-, 3-, and 5-year terms. An active contract gives you full access to Cumulus Linux updates and NVIDIA's 24/7 enterprise-class support team, which are essential to running a mission critical production environment. Software Updates and Support includes:

- All software upgrades, including major and minor software releases.
- All software updates, including maintenance releases and security patches.
- Technical support.

When you purchase a Cumulus Linux license, you receive:

- Your order confirmation with proof of your purchase and entitlement to run the software, obtain updates, and receive technical support.
- Access to the {{<exlink url="https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/" text="NVIDIA Enterprise support portal">}}, which includes account and user management, license and contract management, 24x7 support, and Cumulus Linux software downloads.

You need to purchase the hardware separately.

## How much does a Cumulus Linux license cost?

Contact the NVIDIA {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/contact/sales/" text="sales team">}} for more information.

## How can I order a Cumulus Linux license?
<!-- vale on -->
NVIDIA partners with approved resellers and distributors to facilitate your license procurement. Sign up on the {{<exlink url="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/contact/sales/" text="NVIDIA website">}} for help and information on approved resellers.

NVIDIA does not sell any hardware; however, resellers often do.

## On how many switches can I run Cumulus Linux?
<!-- vale on -->
You can run Cumulus Linux concurrently on the number of switches equal to the number of licenses you have.

## Are Cumulus Linux licenses tied to specific hardware?

Cumulus Linux subscriptions are not tied to the specific hardware acquired atÂ the time of purchase, but one license can run on just one switch at any given time. You can transfer a license from one switch to another, provided:

- You are keeping within the number of licenses noted in your account entitlement inventory.
- The replacement switch has the same maximum port speed, such as 25G.
- The replacement switch has the same type of ASIC, such as Broadcom Tomahawk or NVIDIA Spectrum.
- The license has the same term.

Because Cumulus Linux subscriptions are not tied to hardware, you can stock extra switches that meet the above requirements as backups to quickly replace any failing hardware. For instance, if you purchase two Cumulus Linux, 10G, one year subscriptions, you can run Cumulus Linux on two switches concurrently. If one of the two switches you are using fails, you can install the Cumulus Linux license file that is on that failing hardware to one of your spare switches, so long as it meets the requirements specified above.

## How do I know how many licenses I already have purchased and how do I find the expiration dates for my Software Updates and Support contracts?
<!-- vale on -->
When you purchase a Cumulus Linux license, you get access to the {{<exlink url="https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/" text="NVIDIA Enterprise support portal">}}. After logging in to the portal, you can view your complete license history including active, pending, and expired Software Updates and Support contracts.

## How can I get a copy of the NVIDIA EULA (end-user license agreement)?
<!-- vale on -->
Click the following link to view {{<exlink url="https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/knowledge-base/Support/Licensing/Cumulus-Linux-EULA/" text="the EULA">}}.
<!-- vale off -->
## When does my Software Updates and Support contract start?
<!-- vale on -->
- **New license with a Software Updates and Support contract:** Upon purchase, you have 45 days to activate the license and Software Updates and Support contract through the {{<exlink url="https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/" text="NVIDIA Enterprise support portal">}}. The date when you activate your contract is the start date. If not activated before 45 days, your contract automatically activates on the forty-fifth day after purchase.

    If you procured your license through Dell, your contract starts within 2 business days after you claim your license from the NVIDIA portal.
- **Renewal:** Renewals start on the last active date of the contract, regardless of when you purchased the renewal. For example, your Cumulus Linux 10G 1 year support contract starts on February 2, 2016 and expires on February 2, 2017. Renewal starts on February 2, 2017.
- **Co-term:** Co-terminable contract start on the last active date of the contract, the same as renewals. For more information on co-terms, contact your account team.

## What happens when the Software Updates and Support contract expires?

Cumulus Linux licenses are perpetual but Software Updates and Support contracts are terms. With an expired contract you lose access to Cumulus Linux software updates or upgrades, and cannot contact the NVIDIA 24/7 enterprise-class support team, which are essential to running a mission critical production environment.
