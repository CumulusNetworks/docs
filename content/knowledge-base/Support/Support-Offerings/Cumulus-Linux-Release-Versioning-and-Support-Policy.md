## Version Definitions

The Cumulus Linux installation file name includes the version number, in
the form of CumulusLinux\_x.y.z; for Cumulus RMP, it is CumulusRMP\_x.y.z.

- **x** represents the major release version number. An increased major release version means that the release may include:
    - Significant architectural or engineering changes.
    - New hardware platforms, including new ASICs or chipsets.
    - New functionality and features.
    - Bug fixes.
    - Security updates.
- **y** represents the minor release version number. An increased
    minor release version means that the release may include:
    - New hardware platforms, including new ASICs or chipsets.
    - New functionality and features.
    - Bug fixes.
    - Security updates.
- **z** represents the maintenance release version number. An
    increased maintenance release version may include:
    - New hardware platforms for existing ASICs or chipsets.
    - Bug fixes and updates.
    - Security updates.

## Release, Support Lifecycle and Support Policy

Cumulus Networks supports both mainline and Extended Support Releases
(ESRs). This support mechanism allows us to maintain our desire to
innovate, while providing customers with stable releases once the
architectural needs are met.

Consistent with this two-pronged approach, the mainline and ESR code
branches are separate code bases. As such, issues and fixes in one
branch are independent of the other. The ESR branch is prioritized for
stability first and foremost, so any fixes there are focused on
critical-impact security fixes and urgent bug fixes. This ensures
customers deploying an ESR release can experience minimal disruption in
their day to day network operations.

The following diagram illustrates the ESR and mainline branches, and the
table below it describes the characteristics of each.
