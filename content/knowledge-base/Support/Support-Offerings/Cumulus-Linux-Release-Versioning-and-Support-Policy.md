## Version Definitions

The Cumulus Linux installation file name includes the version number, in the form of CumulusLinux\_x.y.z; for Cumulus RMP, it is CumulusRMP\_x.y.z.

- **x** represents the major release version number. An increased major release version means that the release might include:
    - Significant architectural or engineering changes.
    - New hardware platforms, including new ASICs or chipsets.
    - New functionality and features.
    - Bug fixes.
    - Security updates.
- **y** represents the minor release version number. An increased minor release version means that the release might include:
    - New hardware platforms, including new ASICs or chipsets.
    - New functionality and features.
    - Bug fixes.
    - Security updates.
- **z** represents the maintenance release version number. An increased maintenance release version might include:
    - New hardware platforms for existing ASICs or chipsets.
    - Bug fixes and updates.
    - Security updates.

## Release, Support Lifecycle and Support Policy

NVIDIA supports both mainline and Extended Support Releases (ESRs). This support mechanism allows NVIDIA to maintain its desire to innovate, while providing stable releases as soon as it meets the architectural needs.

Consistent with this two-pronged approach, the mainline and ESR code branches are separate code bases. As such, issues and fixes in one branch are independent of the other. NVIDIA prioritizes the ESR branch for stability; any fixes on that branch focus on critical-impact security fixes and urgent bug fixes. This ensures that if you deploy an ESR release, you experience minimal disruption in day to day network operations.

The following diagram illustrates the ESR and mainline branches, and the table below it describes the characteristics of each.

## Product End of Life

Cumulus Linux and Cumulus RMP 3.7.12 have transitioned into the extended support phase (ESR). You can choose to continue using Cumulus Linux 3.7 ESR, a mature and stable operating system, or you can upgrade to Cumulus Linux 4.y.z, with the latest and greatest features. NVIDIA supports and maintains Cumulus Linux and Cumulus RMP 3.7 ESR for 3 years, until 21 February, 2023.

### Cumulus Linux 5.y.z

| Cumulus Linux Version | ESR Start Date    | End of Life Date  |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 5.0.z                 | N/A               | November 2024     |
| 5.y.z                 | February 2024     | February 2027     |

- All Cumulus Linux 5.y releases are supported until November 2024. The February 2024 release will be an ESR release.
- Cumulus Linux 5.y.z supports Spectrum based switches only.

### Cumulus Linux 4.y.z

| Cumulus Linux Version | ESR Start Date    | End of Life Date  |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 4.y.z (Spectrum based switches) | N/A     | December 2022     |
| 4.3.z (Broadcom based switches) | N/A     | December 2025     |

- The Cumulus Linux 4.y.z release will not have an ESR version. NVIDIA recommends that you run the latest Cumulus Linux 4.3.z release on Broadcom switches and the Cumulus Linux 4.4.z release on Spectrum switches.
- Cumulus Linux 4.y.z through 4.3.z is in maintenance mode; no new features are planned.

### Cumulus Linux 3.y.z

| Cumulus Linux Version | ESR Start Date    | End of Life Date  |
