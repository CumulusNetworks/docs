This number corresponds to the release version of the software. For NetQ
there are two Debian packages that are required per release. This

## Release, Support Lifecycle and Support Policy

Cumulus NetQ is licensed per Cumulus Linux switch. NetQ is a
subscription-based license that includes support for 1, 3, and 5 years
options. NetQ has one set of SKUs for 1G switches and one set of SKUs
for switches that are 10G and greater. The NetQ agent can be installed
free-of-charge on Ubuntu, Red Hat, and CentOS endpoint that is connected
to a NetQ-licensed Cumulus Linux switch. The subscription model
enables customers to upgrade the software as updates and new versions
become available, for the period of the subscription.

Updates are automatically applied. Minor releases are planned each
quarter, with maintenance releases as needed. Customers are notified
before upgrades are performed, and release notes are available for each release.

Customers with current NetQ 1.4 and earlier perpetual licenses have the
option to transfer to the five (5) year NetQ Cloud subscription where
they will receive the NetQ 3.x software, support, and upgrades for free.  

## Product End of Life

Currently, there are no end of life plans for Cumulus NetQ 2.2.
