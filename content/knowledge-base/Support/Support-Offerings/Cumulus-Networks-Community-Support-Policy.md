At Cumulus Networks we understand the importance of community. To that end, we are providing the {{<exlink url="https://slack.cumulusnetworks.com/" text="Cumulus Networks Community">}} to ensure that users have the ability to search for answers and ask questions outside of normal support channels.

Cumulus Networks provides the community spaces with a goal of sustaining a community that is vibrant, interactive and following proper community etiquette. There are a couple of ground rules that go a long way to ensure the community is as valuable as possible for everyone.

## Support vs. Community

First and foremost, Cumulus Networks Community should not be used in lieu of formal Cumulus Networks Global Support Services (GSS) engagement for time-sensitive or production-impacting issues. For issues that are time sensitive or impacting production environments, please engage the Cumulus Networks GSS team {{<exlink url="https://support.mellanox.com/s/contact-support-page" text="here">}}.

Issues and questions raised on the Cumulus Networks Community site do not come with any formal SLA or response guarantee. Issues are just as likely to be answered by an interested peer as they are to be answered by a Cumulus Networks employee.  One of the most important characteristics of any vibrant community is that the sponsoring company does not directly drive the community but merely provides the infrastructure and administration.

## Customer-sensitive Information

Because the nature of a community site is that it is by definition public, please do not share any data or log information that you or your company would consider confidential. If such information is required for the resolution of the issue, please either redact the logs or open a formal support request via  {{<exlink url="https://support.mellanox.com/s/contact-support-page" text="the Support Overview page">}}. Cumulus Networks will not be responsible for information shared on the community space. Please let us know immediately if something was posted that should not have been via email to <community@cumulusnetworks.com>.

## Help Beyond Cumulus Products

If your question or issue extends beyond Cumulus Networks products, you can certainly raise that query via the Cumulus Networks Community. The community may be able to provide guidance for configuration and interoperability with products from other vendors. However, the Cumulus Networks Community site is not an alternative to formal support for either Cumulus Networks products or third party software or platforms.

## Respect and Etiquette

The community is intended to be a safe and respectful place to search for answers to questions regarding Cumulus Networks products and their interoperation with third party software and platforms. Cumulus Networks reserves the right (but not the obligation) to moderate, edit, or delete posts, or ban users in each case when it determines appropriate, in its sole discretion.
