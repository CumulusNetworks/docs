## Cumulus Linux Repos for Versions 4.0.0 and Later
<!-- vale on -->
Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and later distributions come in a single package source for each minor (4.y) release, with the most recent repo called *latest*.

<!-- vale off -->
The *latest* source is enabled by default. In addition to packages in the Cumulus Linux image, the default configuration provides access to additional packages such as `iperf` or `git`, as well as Cumulus-provided updates for all these packages.
<!-- vale on -->
Security fixes and early access features also go into the latest source.

If you want to change to a more specific distribution (from latest to latest minor release or a specific version), you need to manually edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list`file for both the distribution and the source distribution (deb and deb-src).

You can install Debian packages and Debian source packages from upstream by uncommenting the corresponding lines in `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
    # Cumulus Linux package repository
    deb      http://apt.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-4-latest cumulus upstream netq
    deb-src  http://apt.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-4-latest cumulus upstream netq
    
    # Debian 10 Buster main package repositories
    # Uncomment these if you want to install upstream Debian packages
    # that are not mirrored in the Cumulus Linux repositories.
    # Packages installed this way may cause problems, and are not
    # officially supported by Cumulus Networks, Inc.
    #deb     http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
    #deb     http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-updates main
    #deb     http://security.debian.org buster/updates main
    #deb     http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
    
    # Debian 10 Buster main package source repositories
    # Only need to uncomment these if you want to install
    # upstream Debian source packages

\*\* In development. Does not contain packages as of the Cumulus Linux 3.0 initial release.
<!-- vale off -->
The *mainline*, *security* and *updates* sources are enabled by default. In addition to packages in the Cumulus Linux image, the default configuration provides access to additional packages such as `iperf` or `git`, as well as Cumulus-provided updates for all these packages.
<!-- vale on -->
To maintain access to the latest Cumulus Linux updates, keep the *updates* source enabled.

If you're an early adopter or are testing out new features that are not yet in Cumulus Linux mainline, you can enable the `early-access` source.

You can enable non-default sources by uncommenting the corresponding lines in `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
    
    deb     http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3 cumulus upstream
    deb-src http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3 cumulus upstream
    
    deb     http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3-security-updates cumulus upstream
    deb-src http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3-security-updates cumulus upstream
    
    deb     http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3-updates cumulus upstream
    deb-src http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3-updates cumulus upstream
    
    #deb     http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3-early-access cumulus
    #deb-src http://repo3.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3-early-access cumulus
    
    # Currently under construction
    #deb     http://community.cumulusnetworks.com/repo CumulusLinux-3-marketplace commercial community

The contents of each repository component in `sources.list` are as follows:

- **cumulus:** Contains packages maintained by NVIDIA.
- **upstream**: Contains unmodified packages from an upstream community.
- **commercial**: Contains packages from third party vendors.
- **community**: Contains community-contributed packages.
<!-- vale off -->
## Cumulus Linux Versions 1.5.z and 2.y.z Repos

Cumulus Linux distributions for versions 1.5.z and 2.y.z are organized into the following components:
<!-- vale on -->
- **main**: This contains all the packages that are in the Cumulus Linux image, including packages from Debian and other sources.
- **addons**: This contains additional packages that are not in the image (for example, Puppet from Puppet Labs).
- **updates**: This contains updates to any of the packages in main that are not security related.
- **security-updates**: This contains updates to any of the packages in main that are security related.
- **testing**: This contains packages that are still undergoing development.

You can select which repositories you want to draw from using apt by uncommenting the appropriate repos in `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
    #  The Cumulus Package Repository.
    #
    #  Only packages from this repository are supported
    #
    #
    
    deb http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5 main addons updates
    deb http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5 security-updates
    
    # Uncomment the next line to get access to the testing component
    # deb http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5 testing
    
    # Uncomment the next line to get access to the Cumulus community repository
    # deb http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com/community/ CumulusLinux-Community-2.5  main addons updates

## Accessing the Repository

To access packages from the repository server, just follow Debian convention and use `apt-get`. You can find details in the [Cumulus Linux user guide]({{<ref "/cumulus-linux-43" >}}).
