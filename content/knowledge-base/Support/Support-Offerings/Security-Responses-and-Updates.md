NVIDIA believes in the Linux model of security through transparency. NVIDIA constantly monitors security advisories and provides updated packages and notifies users when major vulnerabilities affect Cumulus Linux.

Subscribe to the {{<exlink url="https://lists.cumulusnetworks.com/listinfo/cumulus-security-announce" text="Cumulus Networks Security Announcements">}} mailing list so you can receive notification from NVIDIA whenever the team discovers a security issue.

NVIDIA tracks all security issues on the mailing list and references them in {{<link url="Cumulus-Linux-Security-Announcements" text="this article">}}.

## Security Policy
<!-- vale off -->
Because Cumulus Linux is based on Debian, NVIDIA will, within a reasonable time frame, address security problems that adhere to the {{<exlink url="http://www.debian.org/security/" text="Debian policies in place">}}.
<!-- vale on -->
Every Cumulus Linux release includes all applicable security patches available before the build date. NVIDIA evaluates any new vulnerabilities listed by Debian after the release and addresses them in a package update in the {{<exlink url="http://apt.cumulusnetworks.com/repo" text="Cumulus Linux repository">}}.

## Upgrading Cumulus Linux for Security Updates

When {{<link url="Cumulus-Linux-Security-Announcements" text="NVIDIA">}} or {{<exlink url="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/" text="Debian.org">}} issue a critical security update, NVIDIA updates Cumulus Linux and describes the nature of the update in {{<link url="Security" text="an article in the Security section of the knowledge base">}}. NVIDIA adds other security fixes to the Cumulus Linux repositories without announcements (Debian announces all security updates).

If the article **does not specify a procedure for upgrading Cumulus Linux**, follow these steps instead:

1.  Run `apt-get update`.
2.  Run `apt-get upgrade`.

Do not install security patches from Debian directly unless you have consulted with NVIDIA directly.

## Discovering Security Issues

Users who become aware of a security vulnerability in Cumulus Linux should contact NVIDIA with details of the vulnerability. Send descriptions of any vulnerabilities to <security@cumulusnetworks.com>.

Any vulnerability reported through customers, and not yet reported by {{<exlink url="http://www.debian.org/security/#DSAS" text="Debian">}} get reported to the Debian security team (<security@debian.org> or <team@security.debian.org>). As a result, a bug gets filed in Debian BTS with a tag of *security*.

In addition, NVIDIA works in conjunction with Debian's security team to resolve the issue and publish an advisory as quickly as possible.

## Contacting the NVIDIA Security Team

As noted above, contact <security@cumulusnetworks.com> with any security-related questions and issues.
