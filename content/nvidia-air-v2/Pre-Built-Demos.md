NVIDIA Air offers preconfigured network simulations---also called labs or demos---in the [Demo Marketplace](https://air-ngc.nvidia.com/demos). You can clone these demos and use them to learn about network configuration best practices, try out new features, and experiment with different environments or fabrics. They are completely yours to learn from, explore, destroy, and rebuild. Each demo includes a link to documentation that explains the goals of the simulation and provides step-by-step instructions or general information about the demo.

- Click **Launch** on any demo to create a copy of the simulation in your account. Depending on its size, it may take several minutes to deploy the simulation. You can access it from your list of [Simulations](https://air-ngc.nvidia.com/simulations).

- Click **Documentation** to view the instructions for or information about the demo. This link directs you to the GitLab repository which hosts code, configurations, Ansible files, and additional content. GitLab also hosts topology DOT files, which you can use as references when creating custom topologies. You can read more about DOT files and custom topologies in [Custom Topology](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/nvidia-air/Custom-Topology/).
