## The Drag-and-Drop Topology Builder

One way to create fully custom simulations is with the built-in topology builder, which provides a drag-and-drop editor to design any custom network. To get started, navigate to [https://air.nvidia.com/simulations](https://air.nvidia.com/simulations).

1. Select **Create Simulation**.
2. Provide a name for your simulation.
3. Select **Blank Canvas** as the type.
4. (Optional) Assign the simulation to an [Organization](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/nvidia-air/Organizations/).
5. (Optional) Add a [ZTP script](#ztp-scripts) to the simulation.
   1. Toggle on the **Apply ZTP Template** button.
   2. Enter your ZTP script. A default script is prefilled to help get you started.
6. Click **Create**.

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/CreateSimulation.png" alt="" width="800px">}}

### ZTP Scripts

When you create a new simulation, Air gives you the option to add a zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) script. The ZTP script is copied to the simulation's `oob-mgmt-server`. Any node making a ZTP request on the out-of-band management network has access to this ZTP script through a DHCP server and web server running on the `oob-mgmt-server`. 

**ZTP scripts will not be used if the simulation does not have the Out-of-band network enabled.**

A default script is prefilled to help you get started. It implements some common ZTP features on Cumulus Linux, such as changing the default password or downloading SSH keys. You can edit the default script directly in the UI.

{{< expand "View Default ZTP script" >}}

### Manage Nodes

You can drag servers and switches from the **System Palette** to the workspace. Air provides access to hardware models based on available NVIDIA Spectrum switches. The model does not affect the simulation, but allows Air to pre-populate the number of ports based on the switch model. You do not need to use each port.

Select a node to view or edit its properties.
- **Name**: Node hostname.
- **Operating System**: Name of the OS installed on the node. The OS is installed automatically.
- **CPUs**: Number of CPUs. The default is 1 or 2 GB depending on the Spectrum switch.
- **Memory (GB)**: Amount of RAM (default is 2 GB).
- **Storage (GB)**: Amount of hard disk space (default is 10 GB).
- **Connectors**: Choose an available port to connect directly to any port on another node.

Make sure to select **Update Node** when you complete the changes. You can delete nodes by selecting **Delete Node**.

Air also provides **Advanced Options**, such as enabling **UEFI Secure Boot**.

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/AddNode.png" alt="">}}
<br>
When you finish creating your topology, click **Workspace > Start Simulation**. **You cannot add, remove, or edit nodes after the simulation starts for the first time.**

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/WorkspaceStart.png" alt="" width="250px">}}

### OOB Management Network

On the **System Palette**, there is an option to **Enable OOB**. This setting enables the out-of-band management network that connects all nodes with each other. It also adds an `oob-mgmt-switch` and `oob-mgmt-server` to your simulation. When you enable SSH, you SSH into the `oob-mgmt-server`, making this node an ideal starting point for configurations. Air handles the configuration automatically for you.

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/EnableOOB.png" alt="" width="300px">}}

You can add more `oob-mgmt-switches` and `oob-mgmt-servers` to your simulation manually even when **Enable OOB** is set to off. However, you must switch **Enable OOB** on to use the OOB network.

## Importing Custom Topologies with External Files
You can create custom topologies in Air by importing either JSON or DOT files. These files define nodes, attributes, and connections for generating a topology for a network.

You can upload files directly to Air to generate a topology, allowing you to share and create copies of a topology, save the topology in a reusable file, use for automation purposes, and more easily generate very large topologies. You can modify the file with any text editor.

### JSON
JSON files use the `.json` file extension. 

The following is an example of a simple topology with 1 spine, 2 leaf nodes, and 2 servers connected to each leaf.

When viewing the Links within Air after starting the simulation, observe that the nodes are connected based on the file, and
also connected to the out-of-band management network. 

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/JSONLinksExample.png" alt="">}}

{{%notice note%}}
If you omit the `oob` key in your JSON file, the **Enable OOB** will still be set to **on** after you've uploaded your file with default resources and will be automatically connected to each node.
{{%/notice%}}

#### Custom OOB Management Network Resources

You can specify an `oob-mgmt-switch` and `oob-mgmt-server` to customize allocated resources. See the example below.

### DOT

You can also create custom topologies in Air using a DOT file, which is the file type used with the open-source graph visualization software, Graphviz. DOT files are simple, customizable, text-based files.

DOT files use the `.dot` file extension.

{{%notice info%}}
NVIDIA highly recommends using JSON over DOT files due to its improved validation, scalability, and wide adoption around the world. 
{{%/notice%}}

The following is an example of a simple topology with 1 spine, 2 leaf nodes, and 2 servers connected to each leaf.

```
graph "Demo" {
  "spine01" [ function="spine" memory="4096" os="sonic-vs-202305" cpu="2" ]
  "leaf01" [ function="leaf" memory="4096" os="sonic-vs-202305" cpu="2" nic_model="e1000"]
  "leaf02" [ function="leaf" memory="4096" os="sonic-vs-202305" cpu="2" secureboot="true"]
  "server01" [ function="server" memory="2048" os="generic/ubuntu2404" cpu="2"]
  "server02" [ function="server" memory="2048" os="generic/ubuntu2204" cpu="3" storage="20"]
    "leaf01":"eth1" -- "server01":"eth1"
    "leaf02":"eth1" -- "server02":"eth1"
    "leaf01":"eth2" -- "spine01":"eth1"
    "spine01":"eth2" -- "leaf02":"eth2"
}
```

The following sections provide examples for common DOT file customizations.

#### Operating System

You can set the operating system of the node with the `os` option:

```
"server" [os="cumulus-vx-5.10.1"]
```

#### Disk Space

By default, nodes in Air have 10 GB of hard disk space. You can increase the space (in GB) by using the `storage` option:

```
"server" [os="generic/ubuntu2404" storage="20"]
```

#### CPU

You can customize the number of allocated CPUs with the `cpu` option:

```
"server" [os="generic/ubuntu2404" cpu="4"]
```

#### Create Connections

You can create port connections by defining the node and its port with another node and port.

```
"leaf01":"swp49" -- "leaf02":"swp49"
"leaf01":"swp50" -- "leaf02":"swp50"
```

#### Memory

You can customize RAM (in MB) with the `memory` option:

```
"server" [os="generic/ubuntu2404"  memory="2048"]
```

### Examples

Labs in the [Demo Marketplace](https://air.nvidia.com/demos) are maintained with external GitLab repositories. Here you can find the `topology.dot` or `topology.json` file used to build the lab and use it as a reference. To access the files, select **Documentation** on any lab in the Demo Marketplace. It will direct you to the demo's GitLab repository for the lab, where you can download the file used for the demo topology.

### Import a Topology

To import/upload a DOT or JSON topology file to Air, navigate to [air.nvidia.com/simulations](https://air.nvidia.com/simulations).

1. Select **Create Simulation**.
2. Provide a name for the simulation.
3. Select your desired filetype.
4. Upload the file to the UI.
5. (Optional) Assign the simulation to an [organization](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/nvidia-air/Organizations/).
6. (Optional) Add a [ZTP scripts](#ztp-scripts).
     1. Select **Apply ZTP Template**.
     2. Enter your ZTP script. A default script is prefilled to help you get started.
7. (Optional) Click **Advanced** and provide an out-of-band management server configuration script that executes on the `oob-mgmt-server` when the simulation starts.
8. Click **Create**.

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/UploadTopologyFile.png" alt="">}}

Air redirects you to the [Drag-and-Drop topology builder](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/nvidia-air/Custom-Topology/#the-drag-and-drop-topology-builder) with your custom topology created. You can make any further modifications as needed.

### Export a Topology
You can export the topology for any existing simulation. The exported file is JSON formatted. 

From a simulation, click **Workspace > Export Simulation** to export.

{{<img src="/images/guides/nvidia-air/ExportSimulation.png" alt="" width="250px">}}

### A Note about Storage

If you increase the storage of a node higher than its default, and Air does not recognize the increased storage, run the following commands from the node to extend the partition and resize the file system:

```
sudo growpart /dev/vda 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/vda1
```

Verify the change:

```
df -h | grep vda1
/dev/vda1        20G  2.1G   18G  11% /
```

## Import a Topology with the API

You can import JSON formatted topologies through the API.

from air_sdk.v2 import AirApi

air = AirApi(
    authenticate=True,
    username='<username>',
    password='<password-or-token>',
)
simulation = air.simulations.create_from(
    title='<simulation-name>',
    format='JSON',
    content=<topology-content>,
    organization=<optional-organization>
)
```

{{%notice info%}}
This feature requires SDK version `air-sdk>=2.14.0` or later.

## Export a Topology through the API

You can export existing simulations into a JSON representation using the API. Refer to the [API documentation](https://air.nvidia.com/api/#/v2/v2_simulations_export_retrieve) for additional schema details.

{{< expand "Export Instructions" >}}

Use the API v2 SDK to export a simulation:

```
from air_sdk.v2 import AirApi

air = AirApi(
    authenticate=True,
    username='<username>',
    password='<password-or-token>',
)
topology = air.simulations.export(
    simulation='<simulation-instance-or-id>',
    format='JSON',
    image_ids=True,  # defaults to False
)
```

## Create a Custom Topology from the Production Network

This section describes how to create a simulation based on an existing production deployment.

{{%notice info%}}
NVIDIA has validated these scripts in a Linux environment only.
{{%/notice%}}

### Gather cl-support from the Production Network

Use [these Ansible playbooks](https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/features/cl_support_ansible) to gather the `cl-support` script output. The `ReadMe` for the repository provides additional instructions.

### Create topology.dot from the Production Network

After you obtain the `cl-support` output, you can create a `topology.dot` file using [this parser script](https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/features/cl_support_lldp_parser). You can run the script using `python3`. Here is sample output:

```
$ python3 cl_support_lldp_parser.py
Extracting: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_leaf01_20210721_164553.txz
Extracting: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_spine02_20210721_164553.txz
Extracting: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_leaf02_20210721_164553.txz
Extracting: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_spine01_20210721_084129.txz
folder is: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_leaf01_20210721_164553
leaf01
    leaf01:eth0 -- oob-mgmt-switch:swp2
    leaf01:swp31 -- spine01:swp1
    leaf01:swp32 -- spine02:swp1
folder is: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_spine02_20210721_164553
spine02
    spine02:eth0 -- oob-mgmt-switch:swp6
    spine02:swp1 -- leaf01:swp32
    spine02:swp2 -- leaf02:swp32
folder is: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_leaf02_20210721_164553
leaf02
    leaf02:eth0 -- oob-mgmt-switch:swp4
    leaf02:swp31 -- spine01:swp2
    leaf02:swp32 -- spine02:swp2
folder is: /home/cumulus/cl_support_lldp_parser/cl_support_spine01_20210721_084129
spine01
    spine01:eth0 -- oob-mgmt-switch:swp5
    spine01:swp1 -- leaf01:swp31
    spine01:swp2 -- leaf02:swp31
DOTFILE: cl_support_lldp_parser.dot
```

The command writes the output to the `cl_support_lldp_parser.dot` file. You need to manually edit this file to define the node versions and clean up any extra configurations:

```
$ cat cl_support_lldp_parser.dot
graph dc1 {
"leaf01" [function="leaf" ]
"oob-mgmt-switch" [function="leaf" ]
"spine01" [function="leaf" ]
"spine02" [function="leaf" ]
"leaf02" [function="leaf" ]
    "leaf01":"eth0" -- "oob-mgmt-switch":"swp2"
    "leaf01":"swp31" -- "spine01":"swp1"
    "leaf01":"swp32" -- "spine02":"swp1"
    "spine02":"eth0" -- "oob-mgmt-switch":"swp6"
    "spine02":"swp2" -- "leaf02":"swp32"
    "leaf02":"eth0" -- "oob-mgmt-switch":"swp4"
    "leaf02":"swp31" -- "spine01":"swp2"
    "spine01":"eth0" -- "oob-mgmt-switch":"swp5"
}
```

### Restore Configuration Files

After you create the simulation, you can restore the configuration files.

This [python script](https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/features/cl_support_file_extractor)
extracts relevant files and collates them into folders which you can use to restore configurations.

You can also use the [infrastructure-as-code](https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/features/simple-iac)
Ansible playbook to restore configurations.
