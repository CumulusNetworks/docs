NVIDIA Air offers preconfigured network simulations---also called labs or demos---in the [Demo Marketplace](https://air.nvidia.com/demos). You can clone these demos and then use them to learn about network configuration best practices, try out new features, and experiment with different environments or fabrics. They are completely yours to learn from, explore, destroy, and rebuild. Each demo includes a link to documentation that explains the goals of the simulation and provides step-by-step instructions or general information about the demo.

- Click **Launch** on any demo sim to create a copy in your account. Depending on its size, it may take several minutes to deploy and power on. You will find it in your list of available [Simulations](https://air.nvidia.com/simulations).

- Click **Documentation** to view the instructions or information about the demo. This link leads you to the GitLab repository which hosts code, configurations, Ansible files, and additional content.GitLab also hosts topology DOT files, which you can use as references when creating other topologies. You can read more about DOT files and custom topologies in [Custom Topology](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/nvidia-air/Custom-Topology/).
