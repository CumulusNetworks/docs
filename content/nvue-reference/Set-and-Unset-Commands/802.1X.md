{{%notice note%}}
The `nv unset` commands remove the configuration you set with the equivalent `nv set` commands. This guide only describes an `nv unset` command if it differs from the `nv set` command.

## <h>nv set interface \<interface-id\> dot1x eap</h>

Enables and disables 802.1X on an interface.

{{%notice note%}}
- You must configure 802.1X on a bridged interface.
- NVUE enables BPDU guard when you enable 802.1X on an interface; the interface goes into a protodown state if it receives BPDU packets.
- When you enable or disable 802.1X on an interface, `hostapd` reloads; however, existing authorized sessions do not reset.

| Syntax |  Description   |
| ---------  | -------------- |
| `<interface-id>` |  The interface you want to configure. |

## <h>nv set interface \<interface-id\> dot1x mba</h>

Enables and disables MAC-based authentication (MBA) to allow devices to bypass authentication based on their MAC address. This is useful for devices that do not support EAP, such as printers or phones.

{{%notice note%}}
- You must configure MBA on both the RADIUS server and the RADIUS client (the Cumulus Linux switch).
- Changing the MBA settings do not reset existing authorized user ports. However, changing the MBA activation delay restarts hostapd, which forces existing, authorized users to reauthenticate.

## <h>nv set interface \<interface-id\> dot1x auth-fail-vlan</h>

Enables and disables auth-fail VLAN. If a non-authorized supplicant tries to communicate with the switch, you can route traffic from that device to a different VLAN and associate that VLAN with one of the switch ports to which the supplicant is attached. Cumulus Linux assigns auth-fail VLAN by manipulating the PVID of the switch port.

{{%notice note%}}
Changing the auth-fail VLAN settings does not reset existing authorized user ports. However, changing the Auth-fail VLAN ID restarts `hostapd`, which forces existing, authorized users to reauthenticate.
