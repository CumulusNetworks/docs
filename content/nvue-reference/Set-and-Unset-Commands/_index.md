- To see the `nv show` command descriptions, refer to {{<link url="Show-Commands" text="Show Commands">}}.
- To see `nv config` command descriptions, refer to {{<link url="Config-Commands" text="Config Commands">}}.

{{%notice note%}}
The `nv unset` commands remove the configuration you set with the equivalent `nv set` commands. This guide only describes an `nv unset` command if it differs from the `nv set` command.
