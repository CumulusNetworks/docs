Installing NetQ software can be accomplished in one of three ways:

- Deploy the software on your own switch that is running Cumulus Linux version 3.3.2 or later (on-premises or in-cloud deployments)
- Purchase and deploy the Cumulus NetQ Appliance (for on-premises deployments)
- Purchase and deploy the Cumulus NetQ Cloud Appliance (for in-cloud deployments)

In all cases you must also load the NetQ Agent software onto the switches and hosts you want to monitor.

If you are upgrading from a prior version of NetQ, refer to [Upgrade NetQ](/cumulus-netq/Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Upgrade-NetQ/) instead.
