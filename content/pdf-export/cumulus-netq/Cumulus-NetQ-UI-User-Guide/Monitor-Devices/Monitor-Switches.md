With the NetQ UI, you can monitor individual switches separately from
the network. You are able to view the status of services they are
running, health of its various components, and connectivity performance.
Being able to monitor switch component inventory aids in upgrade,
compliance, and other planning tasks. Viewing individual switch health
helps isolate performance issues.

For network-wide monitoring, refer to [Monitor the
Network](/cumulus-netq/Cumulus-NetQ-UI-User-Guide/Monitor-the-Network/).

## Monitor Switch Performance

Viewing detail about a particular switch is essential when
troubleshooting performance issues. With NetQ you can view the overall
performance and drill down to view attributes of the switch, interface
performance and the events associated with a switch. This is
accomplished through the Switches card.

### View the Overall Health of a Switch

When you want to monitor the health of a particular switch, open the
small Switch card. It is unlikely that you would have this card open for
every switch in your network at the same time, but it is useful for
tracking selected switches that may have been problematic in the recent
past or that you have recently installed. The card shows you alarm
status and summary performance score and trend.

To view the summary:

1.  Click {{% imgOld 13 %}}, and select Devices|Switch. A dialog box opens.

    {{% imgOld 14 %}}

2.  Begin typing the hostname of the device you are interested in.
    Select it from the suggested matches when it appears.

    {{% imgOld 15 %}}

3.  Select the size of the card, *L1*, to open the small size card.

    {{% imgOld 16 %}}

4.  Click **Add**, or **Cancel** to exit the process.

    {{% imgOld 17 %}}

In this example, we see that the leaf01 switch has had very few alarms
overall, but the number is trending upward, with a total count of 24
alarms currently.

### View Health Performance Metrics

When you are monitoring switches that have been problematic or are newly
installed, you might want to view more than a summary. Instead, seeing
key performance metrics can help you determine where issues might be
occurring or how new devices are functioning in the network.

To view the key metrics, open the medium Switch card. The card shows you
the overall switch health score and the scores for the key metrics that
comprise that score. The key metric scores are based on the number of
alarms attributed to the following activities on the switch:

  - network services, such as BGP, EVPN, CLAG, NTP, and so forth
  - scheduled traces
  - interface performance
  - platform performance

{{% imgOld 18 %}}

Also included on the card is the total alarm count for all of these
metrics. You can view the key performance metrics as numerical scores or
as line charts over time, by clicking **Charts** or **Score** at the top
of the card.

### View Attributes of a Switch

For a quick look at the key attributes of a particular switch, open the
large Switch card. Attributes are displayed as the default tab.

{{% imgOld 19 %}}

In this example, the items of interest might be the five interfaces that
are down and what version of OS and NetQ Agent the switch is running.

### View Current Resource Utilization for a Switch

The NetQ GUI enables you to easily view the performance of various
hardware components and the network tables. This enables you to
determine whether a switch is reaching its maximum load and compare its
performance with other switches.

To view the resource utilization on a particular switch:

1.  Open the large Switch card.
2.  Hover over the card and click {{% imgOld 20 %}}.
3.  The card is divided into two sections, one displaying
    hardware-related performance through a series of charts, and one
    displaying the performance of the network tables, also through a
    series of charts.

    {{% imgOld 21 %}}

4.  Look at the hardware performance charts. Are there any that are
    reaching critical usage levels? Scroll down to view all available
    charts.
5.  Open a new large Switch card for the same switch and change the time
    period. Is the performance about the same? Better? Worse? The
    results can guide your decisions about upgrade options or just times
    of day when the system is more heavily used.
6.  Optionally, filter for a particular chart, by clicking **Filter**
    above the charts. Begin typing the name of the chart you want to
    focus on; the charts that match the filter remain, while the others
    are hidden from view. Delete the filter to see all charts again.
7.  Look at the network table performance. Are there any tables that are
    reaching their maximum size? Does it stay at that level or spike at
    peak times? Scroll down to view all available charts.
8.  Compare this data with that in the second card you opened in step 5.
    Is the performance about the same? Better? Worse? The results can
    guide you toward any next steps if needed.
9.  Optionally, filter for a particular chart, by clicking **Filter**
    above the charts. Begin typing the name of the chart you want to
    focus on; the charts that match the filter remain, while the others
    are hidden from view. Delete the filter to see all charts again.

### View All Addresses for a Switch

It can be useful to view all of the configured addresses that this
switch is using. You can view all IP addresses or all MAC addresses
using the full screen Switch card.

To view all IP addresses:

1.  Open the full screen Switch card. The **IP addresses** tab is shown
    by default.

    {{% imgOld 22 %}}

2.  Review the addresses for any anomalies, to obtain prefix
    information, determine if it is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, and so
    forth.

3.  To return to the workbench, click {{% imgOld 23 %}} in the top right corner.

To view all MAC addresses:

1.  Open the full screen Switch card and click the **MAC Addresses**
    tab.

    {{% imgOld 24 %}}

2.  Review the addresses for any anomalies, to see the associated egress
    port, associated VLANs, and so forth.

3.  To return to the workbench, click {{% imgOld 25 %}} in the top right corner.

### View All Interfaces on a Switch

You can view all of the configured interfaces on a switch in one place
making it easier to see inconsistencies in the configuration, quickly
see when changes were made, and the operational status.

To view all interfaces:

1.  Open the full screen Switch card and click the **All Interfaces**
    tab.

    {{% imgOld 26 %}}

2.  Look for interfaces that are down, shown in the **State** column.
3.  Look for recent changes to the interfaces, shown in the **Last
    Changed** column.
4.  View details about each interface, shown in the **Details** column.
5.  Verify they are of the correct kind for their intended function,
    shown in the **Type** column.
6.  Verify the correct VRF interface is assigned to an interface, shown
    in the **VRF** column.
7.  To return to the workbench, click {{% imgOld 27 %}} in the top right corner.

## Monitor Switch Component Inventory

Knowing what components are included on all of your switches aids in
upgrade, compliance, and other planning tasks. Viewing this data is
accomplished through the Switch Inventory card.

The full screen Switch Inventory card provides tabs for all components,
ASIC, platform, CPU, memory, disk, and OS components.

{{% imgOld 40 %}}

There are a multitude of ways to view and analyze the available data
within this workflow. A few examples are provided here.

### View a Summary of Communication Status for All Switches

A communication status summary for all of your switches across the
network is available from the small Switch Inventory card.

{{% imgOld 41 %}}

In this example, we see all 13 switches have been heard from recently
(they are fresh).

### View the Number of Types of Any Component Deployed

For each of the components monitored on a switch, NetQ displays the
variety of those component by way of a count. For example, if you have
three operating systems running on your switches, say Cumulus Linux,
Ubuntu and RHEL, NetQ indicates a total unique count of three OSs. If
you only use Cumulus Linux, then the count shows as one.

To view this count for all of the components on the switch:

1.  Open the medium Switch Inventory card.

    {{% imgOld 42 %}}

2.  Note the number in the **Unique** column for each component.  
    In the above example, there are four different disk sizes deployed,
    four different OSs running, four different ASIC vendors and models
    deployed, and so forth.

3.  Scroll down to see additional components.

By default, the data is shown for switches with a fresh communication
status. You can choose to look at the data for switches in the rotten
state instead. For example, if you wanted to see if there was any
correlation to a version of OS to the switch having a rotten status, you
could select **Rotten Switches** from the dropdown at the top of the
card and see if they all use the same OS (count would be 1). It may not
be the cause of the lack of communication, but you get the idea.

### View the Distribution of Any Component Deployed

NetQ monitors a number of switch components. For each component you can
view the distribution of versions or models or vendors deployed across
your network for that component.

To view the distribution:

1.  Open the medium or large Switch Inventory card. Each component has a
    chart showing the distribution.  

    {{% imgOld 43 %}}

    OR

    {{% imgOld 44 %}}

2.  Hover over a segment of the chart to view the name, version, model
    or vendor and the number of switches that have been deployed. You
    can also see the percentage of all switches this total represents.
    On the large Switch Inventory card, hovering also highlights the
    related components for the selected component. This is shown in blue
    here.

    {{% imgOld 45 %}}

3.  Point to additional segments on that component or other components
    to view their detail.

4.  Scroll down to view additional components.

### View the Number of Switches with Invalid or Missing Licenses

It is important to know when you have switches that have invalid or
missing Cumulus Linux licenses, as not all of the features are
operational without a valid license. Simply open the medium or large
Switch Inventory card, and hover over the License chart to see the
count.

{{% imgOld 46 %}}

To view which vendors and platforms have bad or missing licenses, open the large Switch Inventory card, and click {{% imgOld 47 %}} to open the **Platform Details** tab. Hover over the License State bar chart to highlight the vendor and platforms with the various states.

To view *which* switches have invalid or missing licenses, either:

  - hover over the large Switch Inventory card and click {{% imgOld 48 %}} to open the **Platform Details** tab. Above the Licenses State or the Vendor chart, click **Show All**.
  - open the full screen Switch Inventory card.

Then sort the **All Switches** tab data table by the **License State**
column to locate the switches with bad or missing licenses.

### View the Most Commonly Deployed ASIC

It can be useful to know the quantity and ratio of many components
deployed in your network to determine the scope of upgrade tasks,
balance vendor reliance, or for detailed troubleshooting. You can view
the most commonly deployed components in generally the same way. Some
components have additional details contained in large card tabs.

To view the most commonly deployed ASIC, for example:

1.  Open the medium or large Switch Inventory card.

2.  Hover over the *largest* segment in the ASIC chart. The tooltip that
    appears shows you the number of switches with the given ASIC and the
    percentage of your entire switch population with this ASIC.  

    {{% imgOld 50 %}}


    Click on any other component in a similar fashion to see the most
    common type of that component.

3.  If you opened the medium Switch Inventory card, switch to the large card.

4.  Hover over the card, and click {{% imgOld 51 %}} to open the **ASIC Details** tab. Here you can more easily view the
    various vendors and platforms based on the ASIC deployed.

5.  *Hover* over the **Vendor** pie chart
    to highlight which platforms are supported by the vendor; and vice
    versa, hover over the **Platform** pie chart to see which vendor
    supports that platform. Moving your cursor off of the carts removes
    the highlight.

    {{% imgOld 52 %}}

6.  *Click* on a segment of the
    **Vendor** pie chart to drill down and see only that Vendor and its
    supported models. A filter tag is
    placed at the top of the charts.

    {{% imgOld 53 %}}

7.  To return to the complete view of vendors and platforms, click {{% imgOld 54 %}} on the filter tag.

### View the Number of Switches with a Particular NetQ Agent

It is recommended that when you upgrade NetQ that you also upgrade the
NetQ Agents. You can determine if you have covered all of your agents
using the medium or large Switch Inventory card. To view the NetQ Agent
distribution by version:

1.  Open the medium Switch Inventory card.

2.  View the number in the Unique column next to Agent.  

    {{% imgOld 55 %}}

3.  If the number is greater than one, you have multiple NetQ Agent
    versions deployed.

4.  If you have multiple versions, hover over the Agent chart to view
    the count of switches using each version.

5.  For more detail, switch to the large Switch Inventory card.

6.  Hover over the card and click {{% imgOld 56 %}} to open the **Software Details** tab.  

    {{% imgOld 57 %}}

7.  Hover over the chart on the right to view the number of switches
    using the various versions of the NetQ Agent.

8.  Hover over the Operating System chart to see which NetQ Agent
    versions are being run on each OS.  

    {{% imgOld 58 %}}

9.  Click either chart to focus on a particular OS or agent version.

10. To return to the full view, click {{% imgOld 59 %}} in the filter tag.

11. Filter the data on the card by switches that are having trouble
    communicating, by selecting *Rotten Switches* from the dropdown
    above the charts.

### View a List of All Data for a Specific Component

When the small, medium and large Switch Inventory cards do not provide
either enough information or are not organized in a fashion that
provides the information you need, open the full screen Switch Inventory
card. Select the component tab of interest and filter and sort as
desired. Export the data to a third-party tool, by clicking **Export**.
