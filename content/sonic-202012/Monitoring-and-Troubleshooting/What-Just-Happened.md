*What Just Happened* (WJH) is a troubleshooting feature that streams detailed and contextual telemetry data for analysis. It provides real-time visibility into problems in the network, such as hardware packet drops due to buffer congestion, incorrect routing, and ACL or layer 1 problems.

**WJH available on NVIDIA Spectrum switches only.** It distributed as a Debian package that you can install on a SONiC switch. Please contact Mellanox Support to get the WJH Debian package.

## Install WJH

{{%notice info%}}

Before you install, make sure you do not have changes in the running configuration that you want to persist after reboot.

To install WJH:

1. Download the Debian package you received from Mellanox Support onto the SONiC switch.

       admin@switch:~$ sudo curl http://&lt;Mellanox-file-server>/sonic/what-just-happened_1.0.1_amd64.deb -o what-just-happened_1.0.1_amd64.deb
       % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current

       100 91.2M 100 91.2M 0 0 109M 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 109M
2. Install the downloaded package using `dpkg`:

       admin@switch:~$ sudo dpkg -i what-just-happened_1.0.1_amd64.deb 
       Selecting previously unselected package what-just-happened.
       (Reading database ... 27045 files and directories currently installed.)

During the installation, a default configuration required for What Just Happened to run is pushed to CONFIG_DB after you run `config save`. This does not change the existing configuration, it only applies the new one.

## Enable What Just Happened in SONiC

After you install WJH, SONiC treats the new WJH Docker image as any other optional SONiC feature, so SONiC `feature` commands can be applied to WJH like it can for any other SONiC container. You can verify SONiC was installed by running the following command:

```
admin@switch:~$ show feature status
Feature             State     AutoRestart
------------------  --------  -------------
bgp                 enabled   enabled
database            enabled   disabled
dhcp_relay          enabled   enabled
lldp                enabled   enabled
mgmt-framework      enabled   enabled
nat                 disabled  enabled
pmon                enabled   enabled
radv                enabled   enabled
sflow               disabled  enabled
snmp                enabled   enabled
swss                enabled   enabled
syncd               enabled   enabled
teamd               enabled   enabled
telemetry           enabled   enabled
what-just-happened  enabled   disabled 
```

Notice that WJH is in a *disabled* state by default after installation. To enable WJH, run:

    admin@switch:~$ sudo config feature state what-just-happened enabled

Then save the configuration to make the change persistent across reboots.

    admin@switch:~$ sudo config save -y

If you need to make further configuration changes, follow the steps in the {{<exlink url="https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/blob/master/doc/database/multi_database_instances.md" text="SONiC documentation">}} on GitHub.

Any configuration changes made to the `CONTAINER_FEATURE` table are also applied to the What Just Happened container. Thus, you can configure an auto restart of the container or a high memory alert in the same way you can for any other SONiC Docker container. The output below shows the defaults:

```
admin@switch:~$ redis-cli -n 4 hgetall "CONTAINER_FEATURE|what-just-happened"
1) "auto_restart"
2) "disabled"
3) "high_mem_alert"
4) "disabled"
```

After you enable WJH, you can see its Docker container running in the system:

```
admin@switch:~$ docker ps

### How What Just Happened Interoperates with SONiC systemd

`systemd` manages the What Just Happened container just like any other SONiC component, so you can run any `systemctl` command on What Just Happened. To see the status of the service after you enable What Just Happened:

```
admin@switch:~$ sudo systemctl status what-just-happened.service 
what-just-happened.service - Service providing "What-Just-Happened" feature functionality

### Upgrade the WJH Package

To upgrade to another version of the WJH package, use the `dpkg` command.

Make sure the new WJH Debian has the proper SDK version integrated into the image. If the version is not the latest, remove the WJH Debian image **before** rebooting to the new image.

For the latest SDK version, refer to the {{<link url="Release-Notes" text="SONiC Release Notes">}}.

```
admin@switch:~$ sudo dpkg -i what-just-happened-202012_1.2.0_amd64.deb

If you upgrade the SONiC OS on the switch, WJH gets removed. You need to reinstall the WJH package again.

## Configure What Just Happened

The configurations for global settings and channel types are stored in the `/etc/sonic/config_db.json` file.

### Global Configuration

WJH has these global settings:

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| mode | Defines the operation mode for What Just Happened. The mode can be either *debug* or *streaming*, but only debug is available at this time. In debug mode, you can view packets locally on the system using the SONiC CLI. In streaming mode, the CLI is available to you and dropped packets are streamed to a remote collector. |
| nice_level | This setting represents how many CPU resources the What Just Happened process uses relative to other processes running on the switch. You can adjust this setting to control how "nice" the What Just Happened process is to other processes in terms of CPU usage. In order to give more CPU resources to other running processes, you may increase this value. The valid range is from -20 to 19. You can change `nice_level` at runtime while the What Just Happened container is running. |
| pci_bandwidth | <p>Controls what percent of the PCI What Just Happened is allowed to use. Valid range is from 0 to 100. If you change this setting, you must restart the What Just Happened service.</p><pre>admin@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart what-just-happened.service</pre> |

NVIDIA recommends you keep the default values for the global configuration. However, if you need to change one or more of them, edit the the `/etc/sonic/config_db.json` file. The settings are in the WJH table:

```
admin@switch:~$ vi /etc/sonic/config_db.json
"WJH": {
    "global": {
        "mode": "debug", 
        "nice_level": "1", 
        "pci_bandwidth": "50"
    }
}
```

### Channel Types

A channel is an entity from which dropped packets are read. Just as a trap group that has a list of traps, a channel has a list of drop categories:

```
admin@switch:~$ vi /etc/sonic/config_db.json
"WJH_CHANNEL": {
     "forwarding": {
        "drop_category_list": "L2,L3,Tunnel", 
        "type": "raw_and_aggregated"
     }
}
```

The type defines a type of data returned by What Just Happened, one of:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| raw | Provides the raw packets and metadata about the dropped packet, such as timestamp, drop reason, drop category and recommended action. |
| aggregated | Provides an aggregated counter, which shows how many packets of a flow have been dropped as well as metadata about the dropped packets. Aggregation is done based on tuple of source and destination MAC addresses, source and destination IP addresses and ports, ingress port, VLAN, protocol and drop reason. |
| raw_and_aggregated | Combined type, which provides both raw and aggregated information. |

You cannot change this configuration at this time.

### Change the Drop Reason and Recommended Action Messages

What Just Happened uses an XML formatted file for configuring messages displayed in the CLI, as shown in this example:

```
<reason-info>
  <reason-id>204</reason-id>
  <reason>Ingress VLAN filtering</reason>
  <severity>Error</severity>
  <description>Validate the VLAN membership configuration on both ends of the link</description>
</reason-info>
```

You can modify the **severity**, **reason** and **description** fields. When the `what-just-happened` service starts, WJH tries to load `/etc/sonic/wjh/wjh.xml` file that can be provided by the user. If this file does not exist, a default provided by the WJH SDK library is used. You can use the file inside What Just-Happened container as a reference for creating your own:

    admin@switch:~$ docker exec -it what-just-happened less /usr/etc/wjh_lib_conf.xml

Once custom `/etc/sonic/wjh/wjh.xml` file is created, the `what-just-happened` service needs to be restarted to load the new XML file.
