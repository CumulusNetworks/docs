You use the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) to manage additional
applications (in the form of packages) and to install the latest
updates.

## Commands

  - apt-get
  - apt-cache
  - dpkg

## Updating the Package Cache

To work properly, APT relies on a local cache of the available packages.
You must populate the cache initially, and then periodically update it
with `apt-get update`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo apt-get update
    Get:1 http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5 Release.gpg [490 B]
    Get:2 http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5 Release [16.2 kB]
    Get:3 http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5/main powerpc Packages [181 kB]
    Get:4 http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5/addons powerpc Packages [75.1 kB]
    Get:5 http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5/updates powerpc Packages [112 kB]
    Get:6 http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-2.5/security-updates powerpc Packages [28.5 kB]

## Listing Available Packages

Once the cache is populated, use `apt-cache` to search the cache to find
the packages you are interested in or to get information about an
available package. Here are examples of the `search` and `show`
sub-commands:

    cumulus@switch:~$ apt-cache search tcp

    Description: Tool to replay saved tcpdump files at arbitrary speeds
     Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
     replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
     attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
     traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
     programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
     exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
     and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
     production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
     fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
     replication of real traffic seen on real networks.

{{%notice note%}}

The search commands look for the search terms not only in the package
name but in other parts of the package information. Consequently, it
will match on more packages than you would expect.

## Adding a Package

In order to add a new package, first ensure the package is not already
installed in the system:

    cumulus@switch:~$ dpkg -l | grep {name of package}

If the package is installed already, ensure it’s the version you need.
If it’s an older version, then update the package from the Cumulus Linux
repository:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo apt-get update

If the package is not already on the system, add it by running `apt-get
install`. This retrieves the package from the Cumulus Linux repository
and installs it on your system together with any other packages that
this package might depend on.

For example, the following adds the package `tcpreplay` to the system:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo apt-get install tcpreplay

## Listing Installed Packages

The APT cache contains information about all the packages available on
the repository. To see which packages are actually installed on your
system, use `dpkg`. The following example lists all the packages on the
system that have "tcp" in their package names:

    cumulus@switch:~$ dpkg -l \*tcp\*
    Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
    | Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend
    |/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)

    ii  tcpreplay      3.4.3-2+whee powerpc      Tool to replay saved tcpdump file
    cumulus@switch:~$

## Upgrading to Newer Versions of Installed Packages

### Upgrading a Single Package

A single package can be upgraded by simply installing that package again
with `apt-get install`. You should perform an update first so that the
APT cache is populated with the latest information about the packages.

To see if a package needs to be upgraded, use `apt-cache show <pkgname>`
to show the latest version number of the package. Use `dpkg -l
<pkgname>` to show the version number of the installed package.

{{%notice warning%}}

Upgrading a single package in the Cumulus Linux distribution is not
advised unless directed by [Cumulus Networks
Support](https://cumulusnetworks.com/support/overview/).

{{%/notice%}}

### Upgrading All Packages

You can update all packages on the system by running `apt-get update`,
then `apt-get dist-upgrade`. This upgrades all installed versions with
their latest versions but will not install any new packages.

## Adding Packages from Another Repository

As shipped, Cumulus Linux searches the Cumulus Linux repository for
available packages. You can add additional repositories to search by
adding them to the list of sources that `apt-get` consults. See `man
sources.list` for more information.

{{%notice tip%}}

For several packages, Cumulus Networks has added features or made bug
fixes and these packages must not be replaced with versions from other
repositories. Cumulus Linux has been configured to ensure that the
packages from the Cumulus Linux repository are always preferred over
packages from other repositories.

{{%/notice%}}

If you want to install packages that are not in the Cumulus Linux
repository, the procedure is the same as above with one additional step.

{{%notice note%}}

Packages not part of the Cumulus Linux Repository have generally not
been tested, and may not be supported by Cumulus Linux support.

{{%/notice%}}

Installing packages outside of the Cumulus Linux repository requires the
use of `apt-get`, but, depending on the package, `easy-install` and
other commands can also be used.

To install a new package, please complete the following steps:

1.  First, ensure package is not already installed in the system. Use
    the `dpkg` command:

        cumulus@switch:~$ dpkg -l | grep {name of package}

2.  If the package is installed already, ensure it's the version you
    need. If it's an older version, then update the package from the
    Cumulus Linux repository:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo apt-get update
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo apt-get install {name of package}

3.  If the package is not on the system, then most likely the package
    source location is also **not** in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.
    If the source for the new package is **not** in `sources.list`,
    please edit and add the appropriate source to the file. For example,
    add the following if you wanted a package from the Debian repository
    that is **not** in the Cumulus Linux repository:

        deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main
        deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main

    Otherwise, the repository may be listed in `/etc/apt/sources.list`
    but is commented out, as can be the case with the testing
    repository:

        #deb http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-VERSION testing

    To uncomment the repository, remove the \# at the start of the line,
    then save the file:

        deb http://repo.cumulusnetworks.com CumulusLinux-VERSION testing

4.  Run `apt-get update` then install the package:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo apt-get update
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo apt-get install {name of package}
