*Host HA* is a set of L2 and L3 features supporting high availability
for hosts, including multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) for L2 and
[redistribute neighbor](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204339077)
(an experimental L3 feature).

Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation, or MLAG, enables a server or switch with
a two-port bond (such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel,
port group, or trunk) to connect those ports to different switches and
operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This
provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput.

Dual-connected devices can create LACP bonds that contain links to each
physical switch. Thus, active-active links from the dual-connected
devices are supported even though they are connected to two different
physical switches.

A basic setup looks like this:

{{% imgOld 0 %}}

The two switches, S1 and S2, known as *peer switches*, cooperate so that
they appear as a single device to host H1's bond. H1 distributes traffic
between the two links to S1 and S2 in any manner that you configure on
the host. Similarly, traffic inbound to H1 can traverse S1 or S2 and
arrive at H1.

## MLAG Requirements

MLAG has these requirements:

  - There must be a direct connection between the two peer switches
    implementing MLAG (S1 and S2). This is typically a bond for
    increased reliability and bandwidth.

  - There must be only two peer switches in one MLAG configuration, but
    you can have multiple configurations in a network for
    *switch-to-switch MLAG* (see below).

  - The peer switches implementing MLAG must be running Cumulus Linux
    version 2.5 or later.

  - You must specify a unique `clag-id` for every dual-connected bond on
    each peer switch; the value must be between 1 and 65535 and must be
    the same on both peer switches in order for the bond to be
    considered *dual-connected*.

  - The dual-connected devices (hosts or switches) must use LACP (IEEE
    802.3ad/802.1ax) to form the bond. The peer switches must also use
    LACP.

More elaborate configurations are also possible. The number of links
between the host and the switches can be greater than two, and does not
have to be symmetrical:

{{% imgOld 1 %}}

Additionally, since S1 and S2 appear as a single switch to other bonding
devices, pairs of MLAG switches can also be connected to each other in a
switch-to-switch MLAG setup:

{{% imgOld 2 %}}

In this case, L1 and L2 are also MLAG peer switches, and thus present a
two-port bond from a single logical system to S1 and S2. S1 and S2 do
the same as far as L1 and L2 are concerned. For a switch-to-switch MLAG
configuration, each switch pair must have a unique system MAC address.
In the above example, switches L1 and L2 each have the same system MAC
address configured. Switch pair S1 and S2 each have the same system MAC
address configured; however, it is a different system MAC address than
the one used by the switch pair L1 and L2.

## LACP and Dual-Connectedness

In order for MLAG to operate correctly, the peer switches must know
which links are *dual-connected*, or are connected to the same host or
switch. To do this, specify a `clag-id` for every dual-connected bond on
each peer switch; the `clag-id` must be the same for the corresponding
bonds on both peer switches. [Link Aggregation Control Protocol
(LACP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Aggregation_Control_Protocol#Link_Aggregation_Control_Protocol),
the IEEE standard protocol for managing bonds, is used for verifying
dual-connectedness. LACP runs on the dual-connected device and on each
of the peer switches. On the dual-connected device, the only
configuration requirement is to create a bond that will be managed by
LACP.

On each of the peer switches the links connected to the dual-connected
host or switch must be placed in the bond. This is true even if the
links are a single port on each peer switch, where each port is placed
into a bond, as shown below:

{{% imgOld 3 %}}

All of the dual-connected bonds on the peer switches have their system
ID set to the MLAG system ID. Therefore, from the point of view of the
hosts, each of the links in its bond is connected to the same system,
and so the host will use both links.

Each peer switch periodically makes a list of the LACP partner MAC
addresses of all of their bonds and sends that list to its peer (using
the `clagd` service; see below). The LACP partner MAC address is the MAC
address of the system at the other end of a bond, which in the figure
above would be hosts H1, H2 and H3. When a switch receives this list
from its peer, it compares the list to the LACP partner MAC addresses on
its switch. If any matches are found and the `clag-id` for those bonds
match, then that bond is a dual-connected bond. You can also find the
LACP partner MAC address in the
`/sys/class/net/<bondname>/bonding/ad_partner_mac sysfs` file for each
bond.

## Understanding Switch Roles

Each MLAG-enabled switch in the pair has a role. When the peering
relationship is established between the two switches, one switch will be
in *primary* role, and the other one will be in *secondary* role. When
an MLAG-enabled switch is in the secondary role, it does not send STP
BPDUs on dual-connected links; it only sends BPDUs on single-connected
links. The switch in the primary role sends STP BPDUs on all single- and
dual-connected links.

| Send BPDUs             | Primary | Secondary |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Single-connected links | Yes     | Yes       |
| Dual-connected links   | Yes     | No        |

By default, the role is determined by comparing the MAC addresses of the
two sides of the peering link; the switch with the lower MAC address
assumes the primary role. You can override this by setting the priority
configuration, either by specifying the `clagd-priority` option in
`/etc/network/interfaces`, or by using `clagctl`. The switch with the
lower priority value is given the primary role; the default value is
32768, and the range is 0 to 65535. Read the `clagd(8)` and `clagctl(8)`
man pages for more information.

When the `clagd` service is exited during switch reboot or the service
is stopped in the primary switch, the peer switch that is in the
secondary role will become primary. If the primary switch goes down
without stopping the `clagd` service for any reason or the peer link
goes down, the secondary switch will **not** change its role. In case
the peer switch is determined to be not alive, the switch in the
secondary role will roll back the LACP system ID to be the bond
interface MAC address instead of the `clagd-sys-mac` and the switch in
primary role uses the `clagd-sys-mac` as the LACP system ID on the
bonds.

## Configuring MLAG

Configuring MLAG involves:

  - On the dual-connected devices, create a bond that uses LACP.

  - On each peer switch, configure the interfaces, including bonds,
    VLANs, bridges and peer links.

{{%notice note%}}

MLAG synchronizes the dynamic state between the two peer switches, but
it does not synchronize the switch configurations. After modifying the
configuration of one peer switch, you must make the same changes to the
configuration on the other peer switch. This applies to all
configuration changes, including:

  - Port configuration: For example, VLAN membership,
    [MTU](#understanding-mtu-in-an-mlag-configuration), and
    bonding parameters.

  - Bridge configuration: For example, spanning tree parameters or
    bridge properties.

  - Static address entries: For example, static FDB entries and static
    IGMP entries.

  - QoS configuration: For example, ACL entries.

You can verify the configuration of VLAN membership using the `clagctl
-v verifyvlans` command.

### Reserved MAC Address Range

In order to prevent MAC address conflicts with other interfaces in the
same bridged network, Cumulus Networks has [reserved a range of MAC
addresses](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/203837076)
specifically to use with MLAG. This range of MAC addresses is
44:38:39:ff:00:00 to 44:38:39:ff:ff:ff.

Cumulus Networks recommends you use this range of MAC addresses when
configuring MLAG.

### Configuring the Host or Switch

On your dual-connected device, create a bond that uses LACP. The method
you use varies with the type of device you are configuring. The
following image is a basic MLAG configuration, showing all the essential
elements; a more detailed two-leaf/two-spine configuration is
[below](#example-mlag-configuration).

{{% imgOld 4 %}}

### Configuring the Interfaces

Every interface that connects to the MLAG pair from a dual-connected
device should be placed into a
[bond](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Bonding-Link-Aggregation),
even if the bond contains only a single link on a single physical switch
(since the MLAG pair contains two or more links). Layer 2 data travels
over this bond. In the examples throughout this chapter, *peerlink* is
the name of the bond.

Single-attached hosts, also known as *orphan ports*, can be just a
member of the bridge.

Additionally, the fast mode of LACP should be configured on the bond to
allow more timely updates of the LACP state. These bonds will then be
placed in a bridge, which will include the peer link between the
switches.

In order to enable communication between the `clagd` services on the
peer switches, you should choose an unused VLAN (also known as a
*switched virtual interface* or *SVI* here) and assign an unrouteable
link-local address to give the peer switches layer 3 connectivity
between each other. To ensure that the VLAN is completely independent of
the bridge and spanning tree forwarding decisions, configure the VLAN as
a VLAN subinterface on the peer link bond rather than the VLAN-aware
bridge. Cumulus Networks recommends you use 4094 for the peerlink VLAN
(*peerlink.4094* below) if possible. In addition, to avoid issues with
STP, make sure you include untagged traffic on the peer link.

You can also specify a backup interface, which is any layer 3 backup
interface for your peer links in the event that the peer link goes down.
[See below](#specifying-a-backup-link) for more information about the 
backup link.

For example, if peerlink is the inter-chassis bond, and VLAN 4094 is the
peerlink VLAN, configure peerlink.4094 using:

    auto peerlink.4094
    iface peerlink.4094
      address 169.254.1.1/30
      clagd-enable yes
      clagd-peer-ip 169.254.1.2
      clagd-backup-ip 10.0.1.50
      clagd-sys-mac 44:38:39:FF:40:94

Then run `ifup` on the peerlink VLAN interface. In this example, the
command would be `sudo ifup peerlink.4094`.

There is no need to add VLAN 4094 to the bridge VLAN list, as it is
unnecessary there.

{{%notice note%}}

Keep in mind that when you change the MLAG configuration in the
`interfaces` file, the changes take effect when you bring the peerlink
interface up with `ifup`. Do **not** use `service clagd restart` to
apply the new configuration.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice warning%}}

Do not use 169.254.0.1 as the MLAG peerlink IP address, as Cumulus Linux
uses this address exclusively for 
[BGP unnumbered](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-3-Features/Configuring-Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP/#span-id-src-5116113-configuringbordergatewayprotocol-bgp-unnumbered-class-confluence-anchor-link-span-using-bgp-unnumbered-interfaces-span)
interfaces.

{{%/notice%}}

### Example MLAG Configuration

An example configuration is included below. It configures two bonds for
MLAG, each with a single port, a peer link that is a bond with two
member ports, and three VLANs on each port. You store the configuration
in `/etc/network/interfaces` on each peer switch.

{{% imgOld 5 %}}

Configuring these interfaces uses syntax from `ifupdown2` and the
[VLAN-aware bridge driver mode](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode-for-Large-scale-Layer-2-Environments).
The bridges use these Cumulus Linux-specific keywords:

  - `bridge-vids`, which defines the allowed list of tagged 802.1q VLAN
    IDs for all bridge member interfaces. You can specify non-contiguous
    ranges with a space-separated list, like  
    `bridge-vids 100-200 300 400-500`.

  - `bridge-pvid`, which defines the untagged VLAN ID for each port.
    This is commonly referred to as the *native VLAN*.

The bridge configurations below indicate that each bond carries tagged
frames on VLANs 1000 to 3000 but untagged frames on VLAN 1. Also, take
note on how you configure the VLAN subinterface used for `clagd`
communication (*peerlink.4094* in the sample configuration below).

{{%notice note%}}

At minimum, this VLAN subinterface should not be in your Layer 2 domain,
and you should give it a very high VLAN ID (up to 4094). Read more about
the [range of VLAN IDs you can use](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode-for-Large-scale-Layer-2-Environments/#caveats-and-errata-span).

The configuration for the spines should look like the following (note
that the `clag-id` and `clagd-sys-mac` must be the same for the
corresponding bonds on spine1 and spine2):

The configuration is almost identical, except for the IP addresses used
for managing the `clagd` service.

{{%notice note%}}

In the configurations above, the `clagd-peer-ip` and `clagd-sys-mac`
parameters are mandatory, while the rest are optional. When mandatory
`clagd` commands are present under a peer link subinterface, by default
`clagd-enable` is treated as *yes*; to disable `clagd` on the
subinterface, set `clagd-enable` to *no*. Use `clagd-priority` to set
the role of the MLAG peer switch to primary or secondary. Each peer
switch in an MLAG pair must have the same `clagd-sys-mac` setting. Each
`clagd-sys-mac` setting should be unique to each MLAG pair in the
network. For more details refer to `man clagd`.

### Configuring MLAG with a Traditional Mode Bridge

It's possible to configure MLAG with a bridge in [traditional mode](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/)
instead of [VLAN-aware mode](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode-for-Large-scale-Layer-2-Environments).
In order to do so, the peer link and all dual-connected links must be
configured as
[untagged/native](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-Tagging/)
ports on a bridge (note the absence of any VLANs in the `bridge-ports`
line and the lack of the `bridge-vlan-aware` parameter below):

    auto br
    iface br
      bridge-ports peerlink spine1-2 host1 host2

Because you can have multiple bridges in traditional mode, you can
create more than one bridge on the switch, in case you need to use
tagged VLANs, as the following example shows:

    #native vlan (default vlan1)
    auto bridge
    iface bridge
      bridge-ports peerlink host1 host2 host3
      bridge-stp on
     
    # also can configure additional tagged birdges
    auto bridge1000
    iface bridge1000
      bridge-ports peerlink.1000 host1.1000 host2.1000 host3.1000
      bridge-stp on

{{%notice tip%}}

For a deeper comparison of traditional versus VLAN-aware bridge modes,

### Using the clagd Command Line Interface

A command line utility called `clagctl` is available for interacting
with a running `clagd` service to get status or alter operational
behavior. For detailed explanation of the utility, please refer to the
`clagctl(8)`man page. The following is a sample output of the MLAG
operational status displayed by the utility:

    cumulus@switch$ clagctl
    The peer is alive
         Our Priority, ID, and Role: 8192 00:e0:ec:26:50:89 primary
        Peer Priority, ID, and Role: 8192 00:e0:ec:27:49:f6 secondary
              Peer Interface and IP: peerlink.4094 169.254.255.2
                         System MAC: 44:38:39:ff:00:01
    
                             Dual Attached Ports
          Our Interface      Peer Interface     CLAG Id
          ----------------   ----------------   -------
                 downlink1   downlink1          1
                 downlink2   downlink2          2

## Peer Link Interfaces and the protodown State

In addition to the standard UP and DOWN administrative states, an
interface that is a member of an MLAG bond can also be in a `protodown`
state. When MLAG detects a problem that could result in connectivity
issues such as traffic black-holing or a network meltdown if the link
carrier was left in an UP state, it can put that interface into
`protodown` state. Such connectivity issues include:

  - When the peer link goes down but the peer switch is up (that is, the
    backup link is active).

  - When the bond is configured with an MLAG ID, but the `clagd` service
    is not running (whether it was deliberately stopped or simply died).

  - When an MLAG-enabled node is booted or rebooted, the MLAG bonds are
    placed in a `protodown` state until the node establishes a
    connection to its peer switch, or five minutes have elapsed.

When an interface goes into a `protodown` state, it results in a local
OPER DOWN (carrier down) on the interface. As of Cumulus Linux 2.5.5,
the `protodown` state can be manipulated with the `ip link set` command.
Given its use in preventing network meltdowns, manually manipulating
`protodown` is not recommended outside the scope of interaction with the
Cumulus Networks support team.

The following `ip link show` command output shows an interface in
`protodown` state. Notice that the link carrier is down (NO-CARRIER):

    cumulus@switch:~$ ip link show swp1
    3: swp1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,SLAVE,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master host-bond1 state DOWN mode DEFAULT qlen 500 protodown on
       link/ether 44:38:39:00:69:84 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

### Specifying a Backup Link

You can specify a backup link for your peer links in the event that the
peer link goes down. When this happens, the `clagd` service uses the
backup link to check the health of the peer switch. To configure this,
edit `/etc/network/interfaces` and add `clag-backup-ip <ADDRESS>` to the
peer link configuration.

However, if the eth0 management interface is enabled on a switch with an
MLAG configuration, you cannot specify a backup link over the switch
ports. The backup link uses eth0 if a 
[management VRF](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-3-Features/Management-VRF) is
configured.

Here's an example:

    auto peerlink.4094
    iface peerlink.4094
        address 169.254.255.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        clagd-enable yes
        clagd-priority 8192
        clagd-peer-ip 169.254.255.2
        clagd-backup-ip 10.0.1.50
        clagd-sys-mac 44:38:39:ff:00:01
        clagd-args --priority 1000

{{%notice tip%}}

The backup IP address must be different than the peer link IP address
(`clagd-peer-ip` above), and it must be reachable by a route that
doesn't use the peer link.

Cumulus Networks recommends you use the switch's management IP address
for this purpose.

{{%/notice%}}

You can also specify the backup UDP port. The port defaults to 5342, but
you can configure it as an argument in `clagd-args` using `--backupPort
<PORT>`.

    auto peerlink.4094
    iface peerlink.4094
        address 169.254.255.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        clagd-enable yes
        clagd-priority 8192
        clagd-peer-ip 169.254.255.2
        clagd-backup-ip 10.0.1.50
        clagd-sys-mac 44:38:39:ff:00:01
        clagd-args --backupPort 5400

You can see the backup IP address if you run `clagctl`:

    cumulus@switch$ clagctl
    The peer is alive
         Our Priority, ID, and Role: 8192 00:e0:ec:26:50:89 primary
        Peer Priority, ID, and Role: 8192 00:e0:ec:27:49:f6 secondary
              Peer Interface and IP: peerlink.4094 169.254.255.2
                          Backup IP: 10.0.1.50
                         System MAC: 44:38:39:ff:00:01
    
                             Dual Attached Ports
          Our Interface      Peer Interface     CLAG Id
          ----------------   ----------------   -------
                 downlink1   downlink1          1
                 downlink2   downlink2          2 

## Monitoring Dual-Connected Peers

Upon receipt of a valid message from its peer, the switch knows that
`clagd` is alive and executing on that peer. This causes `clagd` to
change the system ID of each bond that was assigned a `clag-id` from the
default value (the MAC address of the bond) to the system ID assigned to
both peer switches. This makes the hosts connected to each switch act as
if they are connected to the same system so that they will use all ports
within their bond. Additionally, `clagd` determines which bonds are
dual-connected and modifies the forwarding and learning behavior to
accommodate these dual-connected bonds.

If the peer does not receive any messages for three update intervals,
then that peer switch is assumed to no longer be acting as an MLAG peer.
In this case, the switch reverts all configuration changes so that it
operates as a standard non-MLAG switch. This includes removing all
statically assigned MAC addresses, clearing the egress forwarding mask,
and allowing addresses to move from any port to the peer port. Once a
message is again received from the peer, MLAG operation starts again as
described earlier. You can configure a custom timeout setting by adding
`--peerTimeout <VALUE>` to `clagd-args` in `/etc/network/interfaces`.

Once bonds are identified as dual-connected, `clagd` sends more
information to the peer switch for those bonds. The MAC addresses (and
VLANs) that have been dynamically learned on those ports are sent along
with the LACP partner MAC address for each bond. When a switch receives
MAC address information from its peer, it adds MAC address entries on
the corresponding ports. As the switch learns and ages out MAC
addresses, it informs the peer switch of these changes to its MAC
address table so that the peer can keep its table synchronized.
Periodically, at 45% of the bridge ageing time, a switch will send its
entire MAC address table to the peer, so that peer switch can verify
that its MAC address table is properly synchronized.

The switch sends an update frequency value in the messages to its peer,
which tells `clagd` how often the peer will send these messages. You can
configure a different frequency by adding `--lacpPoll <SECONDS>` to
`clagd-args` in `/etc/network/interfaces`.

## Configuring Layer 3 Routed Uplinks

In this scenario, the spine switches connect at layer 3, as shown in the
image below. Alternatively, the spine switches can be singly connected
to each core switch at layer 3 (not shown below).

{{% imgOld 6 %}}

In this design, the spine switches route traffic between the server
hosts in the layer 2 domains and the core. The servers (host1 - host4)
each have a layer 2 connection up to the spine layer where the default
gateway for the host subnets resides. However, since the spine switches
as gateway devices communicate at layer 3, you need to configure a
protocol such as
[VRR](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Virtual-Router-Redundancy-VRR)
(Virtual Router Redundancy) between the spine switch pair to support
active/active forwarding.

Then, to connect the spine switches to the core switches, you need to
determine whether the routing is static or dynamic. If it's dynamic, you
must choose which protocol —
[OSPF](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-3-Features/Open-Shortest-Path-First-OSPF---Protocol)
or
[BGP](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-3-Features/Configuring-Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP)
— to use. When enabling a routing protocol in an MLAG environment it is
also necessary to manage the uplinks, because by default MLAG is not
aware of layer 3 uplink interfaces. In the event of a peerlink failure
MLAG does not remove static routes or bring down a BGP or OSPF adjacency
unless a separate link state daemon such as `ifplugd` is used.

## IGMP Snooping with MLAG

IGMP snooping processes IGMP reports received on a bridge port in a
bridge to identify hosts that are configured to receive multicast
traffic destined to that group. An IGMP query message received on a port
is used to identify the port that is connected to a router and
configured to receive multicast traffic.

IGMP snooping is enabled by default on the bridge. IGMP snooping
multicast database entries and router port entries are synced to the
peer MLAG switch. If there is no multicast router in the VLAN, the IGMP
querier can be configured on the switch to generate IGMP query messages
by adding a configuration like the following to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

    auto br.100
    vlan br.100
        #igmp snooping is enabled by default, but is shown here for completeness
        bridge-mcsnoop 1
        # If you need to specify the querier IP address
        bridge-igmp-querier-src 123.1.1.1

To display multicast group and router port information, use the `bridge
-d mdb show` command:

    cumulus@switch:~# sudo bridge -d mdb show
    dev br port bond0 vlan 100 grp 234.1.1.1 temp
    router ports on br: bond0

<details>
<summary>Runtime Configuration (Advanced) </summary>

    cumulus@switch:~# sudo brctl setmcqv4src br 100 123.1.1.1
    cumulus@switch:~# sudo brctl setmcquerier br 1
    cumulus@switch:~# sudo brctl showmcqv4src br
            
    vlan            querier address
    100             123.1.1.1
</details>

## Monitoring the Status of the clagd Service

Due to the critical nature of the `clagd` service, an external process,
called `jdoo`, continuously monitors the status of `clagd`. If the
`clagd` service dies or becomes unresponsive for any reason, the `jdoo`
process will get `clagd` up and running again. This monitoring is
automatically configured and enabled as long as `clagd` is enabled (that
is, `clagd-peer-ip` and `clagd-sys-mac` are configured in
`/etc/network/interfaces`) and `clagd` been started. When `clagd` is
explicitly stopped, for example with the `service clagd stop` command,
monitoring of `clagd` is also stopped.

The `jdoo` process checks two things to make sure the `clagd` service is
operating properly:

  - The result of the `service clagd status` command. If the command
    returns that `clagd` is running, or that `clagd` is not configured
    to run, then `jdoo` does nothing. If `service clagd status` returns
    that `clagd` is *not* running but was configured to run, `jdoo` will
    start the `clagd` service. This check is performed every 30 seconds.
    Due to the way the `jdoo` process implements this check, it may
    start the `clagd` process twice. This is harmless, since `clagd`
    checks to make sure another instance is not already running when it
    begins executing. This is indicated with a message in the `clagd`
    log file, `/var/log/clagd.log`.

  - The modification time of the `/var/run/clagd.alive` file. As `clagd`
    runs, it periodically updates the modification time of the
    `/var/run/clagd.alive` file (by default, every 4 seconds). If `jdoo`
    notices that this file's modification time has not been updated
    within the last 4 minutes, it will assume `clagd` is alive, but
    hung, and will restart `clagd`. If `clagd` is not enabled to run,
    this check still occurs and `jdoo` will start `clagd`. But since
    `clagd` is not configured to run, nothing will happen except that a
    message is written to the `jdoo` log file that it tried to start
    `clagd`.

You can check the status of `clagd` monitoring by using the `jdoo summary` 
command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo jdoo summary
    The jdoo daemon 5.4 uptime: 15m
    ...
    Program 'clagd'                     Status ok
    File 'clagd.alive'                  Waiting
    ...

## MLAG Best Practices

For MLAG to function properly, the dual-connected hosts' interfaces
should be configured identically on the pair of peering switches. See
the note above in the [Configuring MLAG](#configuring-mlag) section.

### Understanding MTU in an MLAG Configuration

Note that the
[MTU](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Configuring-and-Managing-Network-Interfaces/Layer-1-and-Switch-Port-Attributes/#mtu)
in MLAG traffic is determined by the bridge MTU. Bridge MTU is
determined by the lowest MTU setting of an interface that is a member of
the bridge. If an MTU other than the default of 1500 bytes is desired,
you must configure the MTU on each physical interface and bond interface
that are members of the MLAG bridges in the entire bridged domain.

For example, if an MTU of 9216 is desired through the MLAG domain in the
example shown above:

On the the leaf switches, [configure `mtu 9216`](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Configuring-and-Managing-Network-Interfaces/Layer-1-and-Switch-Port-Attributes/#mtu)
for each of following interfaces, since they are members of bridge
*br0*: spine1-2, peerlink, host1, host2.

    auto br0
    iface br0
       bridge-vlan-aware yes
       bridge-ports spine1-2 peerlink host1 host2   <- List of bridge member interfaces
       ...

Likewise, to ensure the MTU 9216 path is respected through the spine
switches above, also change the MTU setting for bridge *br* by
configuring `mtu 9216` for each of the following members of bridge *br*
on spine1 and spine2: uplinkA, peerlink, downlink1, downlink2.

    auto br
    iface br
        bridge-vlan-aware yes
        bridge-ports uplinkA peerlink downlink1 downlink2 
        ...

## STP Interoperability with MLAG

Cumulus Networks recommends that you always enable STP in your layer 2
network.

Further, with MLAG, Cumulus Networks recommends you enable BPDU guard on
the host-facing bond interfaces. (For more information about BPDU guard,
see [BPDU Guard and Bridge Assurance](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Spanning-Tree-and-Rapid-Spanning-Tree/#bridge-assurance).)

### Debugging STP with MLAG

`/var/log/daemon.log` has `mstpd` logs.

Run `mstpctl debuglevel 3` to see MLAG-related logs in
`/var/log/daemon.log`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl showportdetail br peer-bond
    br:peer-bond CIST info
      enabled            yes                     role                 Designated
      port id            8.008                   state                forwarding
      ...............
      bpdufilter port    no                     
      clag ISL           yes                     clag ISL Oper UP     yes
      clag role          primary                 clag dual conn mac   0:0:0:0:0:0
      clag remote portID F.FFF                   clag system mac      44:38:39:ff:0:1
    cumulus@switch:~$ 
    
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl showportdetail br downlink-1
    br:downlink-1 CIST info
      enabled            yes                     role                 Designated
      port id            8.006                   state                forwarding
      ..............
      bpdufilter port    no                     
      clag ISL           no                      clag ISL Oper UP     no
      clag role          primary                 clag dual conn mac   0:0:0:3:11:1
      clag remote portID F.FFF                   clag system mac      44:38:39:ff:0:1
    cumulus@switch:~$

### Best Practices for STP with MLAG

  - The STP global configuration must be the same on both the switches.

  - The STP configuration for dual-connected ports should be the same on
    both peer switches.

  - Use `mstpctl` commands for all spanning tree configurations,
    including bridge priority, path cost and so forth. Do not use
    `brctl` commands for spanning tree, except for `brctl stp on/off`,
    as changes are not reflected to `mstpd` and can create conflicts.

## Troubleshooting MLAG

By default, when `clagd` is running, it logs its status to the
`/var/log/clagd.log` file and syslog. Example log file output is below:

    Jan 14 23:45:10 switch clagd[3704]: Beginning execution of clagd version 1.0.0
    Jan 14 23:45:10 switch clagd[3704]: Invoked with: /usr/sbin/clagd --daemon 169.254.2.2 peer-bond.4000 44:38:39:ff:00:01 --priority 8192
    Jan 14 23:45:11 switch clagd[3995]: Role is now secondary
    Jan 14 23:45:31 switch clagd[3995]: Role is now primary
    Jan 14 23:45:32 switch clagd[3995]: The peer switch is active.
    Jan 14 23:45:35 switch clagd[3995]: downlink-1 is now dual connected.

### Understanding STP and LACP Behavior when MLAG Fails

For an in-depth look at how LACP and STP react during a number of
failure scenarios, read this [knowledge base article](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/217942577).

## Caveats and Errata

If both the backup and peer connectivity are lost within a 30-second
window, the switch in the secondary role misinterprets the event
sequence, believing the peer switch is down, so it takes over as the
primary.
