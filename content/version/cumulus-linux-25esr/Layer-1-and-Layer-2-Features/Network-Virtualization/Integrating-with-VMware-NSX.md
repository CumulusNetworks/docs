Switches running Cumulus Linux can integrate with VMware NSX to act as
VTEP gateways. The VMware NSX controller provides consistent
provisioning across virtual and physical server infrastructures.

{{% imgOld 0 %}}

## Getting Started

Before you integrate VXLANs with NSX, make sure you have the following
components:

  - A switch (L2 gateway) with a Trident II chipset running Cumulus
    Linux 2.0 or later;
  - OVSDB server (ovsdb-server), included in Cumulus Linux 2.0 and later
  - VTEPd (ovs-vtepd), included in Cumulus Linux 2.0 and later

Integrating a VXLAN with NSX involves:

  - Bootstrapping the NSX Integration
  - Configuring the Transport Layer
  - Configuring the Logical Layer
  - Verifying the VXLAN Configuration

Once you finish the integration, you can make the configuration
persistent across upgrades (see 
[Persistent VXLAN Configuration in NSX](#persistent-vxlan-configuration-in-nsx) below).

### Caveats and Errata

  - As mentioned in [Network
    Virtualization](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Network-Virtualization/),
    the switches with the source and destination VTEPs cannot reside on
    the same subnet; there must be at least one layer 3 hop between the
    VXLAN source and destination.

  - There is no support for VXLAN routing in the Trident II chip; use a
    loopback interface or external router.

  - Do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values
    under Cumulus Linux.

  - For more information about NSX, see the VMware NSX User Guide,
    version 4.0.0 or later.

## Bootstrapping the NSX Integration

Before you start configuring the gateway service and logical switches
and ports that comprise the VXLAN, you need to complete some steps to
bootstrap the process. You need to do the bootstrapping just once,
before you begin the integration.

### Enabling the openvswitch-vtep Package

Before you start bootstrapping the integration, you need to enable the
`openvswitch-vtep` package, as it is disabled by default in Cumulus
Linux.

1.  In `/etc/default/openvswitch-vtep`, change the `START` option from
    *no* to *yes*:
    
        cumulus@switch$ cat /etc/default/openvswitch-vtep
        # This is a POSIX shell fragment                -*- sh -*-
        
        # Start openvswitch at boot ? yes/no
        START=yes
        
        # FORCE_COREFILES: If 'yes' then core files will be enabled.
        # FORCE_COREFILES=yes
        
        # BRCOMPAT: If 'yes' and the openvswitch-brcompat package is installed, then
        # Linux bridge compatibility will be enabled.
        # BRCOMPAT=no

2.  Start the daemon:
    
        cumulus@switch$ sudo service openvswitch-vtep start

Make sure to include this file in your persistent configuration (see
[Persistent VXLAN Configuration in NSX](#persistent-vxlan-configuration-in-nsx) 
below) so it's available after you upgrade Cumulus Linux.

### Using the Bootstrapping Script

A script is available so you can do the bootstrapping automatically. For
information, read `man vtep-bootstrap`. The output of the script is
displayed here:

{{% imgOld 1 %}}

In the above example, the following information was passed to the
`vtep-bootstrap` script:

  - `--credentials-path /var/lib/openvswitch`: Is the path to where the
    certificate and key pairs for authenticating with the NSX controller
    are stored.
  - `vtep7`: is the ID for the VTEP.
  - `192.168.100.17`: is the IP address of the NSX controller.
  - `172.16.20.157`: is the datapath IP address of the VTEP.
  - `192.168.100.157`: is the IP address of the management interface on
    the switch.

These IP addresses will be used throughout the rest of the examples
below.

### Manually Bootstrapping the NSX Integration

If you don’t use the script, then you must:

  - Initialize the OVS database instance
  - Generate a certificate and key pair for authentication by NSX
  - Configure a switch as a VTEP gateway

These steps are described next.

### Generating the Credentials Certificate

First, in Cumulus Linux, you must generate a certificate that the NSX
controller uses for authentication.

1.  In a terminal session connected to the switch, run the following
    commands:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ovs-pki init
        Creating controllerca...
        Creating switchca...
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ovs-pki req+sign cumulus
        
        cumulus-req.pem Wed Oct 23 05:32:49 UTC 2013
                fingerprint b587c9fe36f09fb371750ab50c430485d33a174a
        cumulus@switch:~$
        cumulus@switch:~$ ls -l
        total 12
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4028 Oct 23 05:32 cumulus-cert.pem
        -rw------- 1 root root 1679 Oct 23 05:32 cumulus-privkey.pem
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3585 Oct 23 05:32 cumulus-req.pem

2.  In `/usr/share/openvswitch/scripts/ovs-ctl-vtep`, make sure the
    lines containing **private-key**, **certificate** and
    **bootstrap-ca-cert** point to the correct files;
    **bootstrap-ca-cert** is obtained dynamically the first time the
    switch talks to the controller:
    
        # Start ovsdb-server.
        set ovsdb-server "$DB_FILE"
        set "$@" -vANY:CONSOLE:EMER -vANY:SYSLOG:ERR -vANY:FILE:INFO
        set "$@" --remote=punix:"$DB_SOCK"
        set "$@" --remote=db:Global,managers
        set "$@" --remote=ptcp:6633:$LOCALIP
        set "$@" --private-key=/root/cumulus-privkey.pem
        set "$@" --certificate=/root/cumulus-cert.pem
        set "$@" --bootstrap-ca-cert=/root/controller.cacert
    
    If files have been moved or regenerated, restart the OVSDB server
    and `vtepd`:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo service openvswitch-vtep restart

3.  Define the NSX controller cluster IP address in OVSDB. This causes
    the OVSDB server to start contacting the NSX controller:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtep-ctl set-manager ssl:192.168.100.17:6632

4.  Define the local IP address on the VTEP for VXLAN tunnel
    termination. First, find the physical switch name as recorded in
    OVSDB:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtep-ctl list-ps
        vtep7
    
    Then set the tunnel source IP address of the VTEP. This is the
    datapath address of the VTEP, which is typically an address on a
    loopback interface on the switch that is reachable from the
    underlying L3 network:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo vtep-ctl set Physical_Switch vtep7 tunnel_ips=172.16.20.157

Once you finish generating the certificate, keep the terminal session
active, as you need to paste the certificate into NSX Manager when you
configure the VTEP gateway.

### Configuring the Switch as a VTEP Gateway

After you create a certificate, connect to NSX Manager in a browser to
configure a Cumulus Linux switch as a VTEP gateway. In this example, the
IP address of the NSX manager is 192.168.100.12.

1.  In NSX Manager, add a new gateway. Click the **Network Components**
    tab, then the **Transport Layer** category. Under **Transport
    Node**, click **Add**, then select **Manually Enter All Fields**.
    The Create Gateway wizard appears.
    
    {{% imgOld 2 %}}

2.  In the Create Gateway dialog, select *Gateway* for the **Transport
    Node Type**, then click **Next**.

3.  In the **Display Name** field, give the gateway a name, then click
    **Next**.

4.  Enable the VTEP service. Select the **VTEP Enabled** checkbox, then
    click **Next**.

5.  From the terminal session connected to the switch where you
    generated the certificate, copy the certificate and paste it into
    the **Security Certificate** text field. Copy only the bottom
    portion, including the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE`
    lines. For example, copy all the highlighted text in the terminal:
    
    {{% imgOld 3 %}}
    
    And paste it into NSX Manager:
    
    {{% imgOld 4 %}}
    
    Then click **Next**.

6.  In the Connectors dialog, click **Add Connector** to add a transport
    connector. This defines the tunnel endpoint that terminates the
    VXLAN tunnel and connects NSX to the physical gateway. You must
    choose a tunnel **Transport Type** of *VXLAN*. Choose an existing
    transport zone for the connector, or click **Create** to create a
    new transport zone.

7.  Define the connector’s IP address (that is, the underlay IP address
    on the switch for tunnel termination).

8.  Click **OK** to save the connector, then click **Save** to save the
    gateway.

Once communication is established between the switch and the controller,
a `controller.cacert` file will be downloaded onto the switch.

Verify the controller and switch handshake is successful. In a terminal
connected to the switch, run this command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ovsdb-client dump -f list | grep -A 7 "Manager"
    Manager table
    _uuid               : 505f32af-9acb-4182-a315-022e405aa479
    inactivity_probe    : 30000
    is_connected        : true
    max_backoff         : []
    other_config        : {}
    status              : {sec_since_connect="18223", sec_since_disconnect="18225", state=ACTIVE}
    target              : "ssl:192.168.100.17:6632"

## Configuring the Transport Layer

After you finish bootstrapping the NSX integration, you need to
configure the transport layer. For each host-facing switch port that is
to be associated with a VXLAN instance, define a **Gateway Service** for
the port.

1.  In NSX Manager, add a new gateway service. Click the **Network
    Components** tab, then the **Services** category. Under **Gateway
    Service**, click **Add**. The Create Gateway Service wizard appears.

2.  In the Create Gateway Service dialog, select *VTEP L2 Gateway
    Service* as the **Gateway Service Type**.
    
    {{% imgOld 5 %}}

3.  Give the service a **Display Name** to represent the VTEP in NSX.

4.  Click **Add Gateway** to associate the service with the gateway you
    created earlier.

5.  In the **Transport Node** field, choose the name of the gateway you
    created earlier.

6.  In the **Port ID** field, choose the physical port on the gateway
    (for example, swp10) that will connect to a logical L2 segment and
    carry data traffic.

7.  Click **OK** to save this gateway in the service, then click
    **Save** to save the gateway service.

The gateway service shows up as type *VTEP L2* in NSX.

Next, you will configure the logical layer on NSX.

## Configuring the Logical Layer

To complete the integration with NSX, you need to configure the logical
layer, which requires defining a logical switch (the VXLAN instance) and
all the logical ports needed.

### Defining Logical Switches

To define the logical switch, do the following:

1.  In NSX Manager, add a new logical switch. Click the **Network
    Components** tab, then the **Logical Layer** category. Under
    **Logical Switch**, click **Add**. The Create Logical Switch wizard
    appears.

2.  In the **Display Name** field, enter a name for the logical switch,
    then click **Next**.
    
    {{% imgOld 7 %}}

3.  Under **Replication Mode**, select **Service Nodes**, then click
    **Next**.

4.  Specify the transport zone bindings for the logical switch. Click
    **Add Binding**. The Create Transport Zone Binding dialog appears.
    
    {{% imgOld 8 %}}

5.  In the **Transport Type** list, select *VXLAN*, then click **OK** to
    add the binding to the logical switch.
    
    {{% imgOld 9 %}}

6.  In the **VNI** field, assign the switch a VNI ID, then click **OK**.
    
    {{%notice note%}}
    
    Do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values
    under Cumulus Linux.
    
    {{%/notice%}}

7.  Click **Save** to save the logical switch configuration.  
    
    {{% imgOld 10 %}}

### Defining Logical Switch Ports

As the final step, define the logical switch ports. They can be virtual
machine VIF interfaces from a registered OVS, or a VTEP gateway service
instance on this switch, as defined above in the Configuring the
Transport Laye. A VLAN binding can be defined for each VTEP gateway
service associated with the particular logical switch.

To define the logical switch ports, do the following:

1.  In NSX Manager, add a new logical switch port. Click the **Network
    Components** tab, then the **Logical Layer** category. Under
    **Logical Switch Port**, click **Add**. The Create Logical Switch
    Port wizard appears.
    
    {{% imgOld 11 %}}

2.  In the **Logical Switch UUID** list, select the logical switch you
    created above, then click **Create**.
    
    {{% imgOld 12 %}}

3.  In the **Display Name** field, give the port a name that indicates
    it is the port that connects the gateway, then click **Next**.

4.  In the **Attachment Type** list, select *VTEP L2 Gateway*.

5.  In the **VTEP L2 Gateway Service UUID** list, choose the name of the
    gateway service you created earlier.

6.  In the **VLAN** list, you can optionally choose a VLAN if you wish
    to connect only traffic on a specific VLAN of the physical network.
    Leave it blank to handle all traffic.

7.  Click **Save** to save the logical switch port. Connectivity is
    established. Repeat this procedure for each logical switch port you
    want to define.
    
    {{% imgOld 13 %}}

## Verifying the VXLAN Configuration

Once configured, you can verify the VXLAN configuration using these
Cumulus Linux commands in a terminal connected to the switch:

    cumulus@switch1:~$ sudo ip –d link show vxln100
    71: vxln100: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master br-vxln100 state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT
        link/ether d2:ca:78:bb:7c:9b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        vxlan id 100 local 172.16.20.157 port 32768 61000 nolearning ageing 300 svcnode 172.16.21.125

or

    cumulus@switch1:~$ sudo bridge fdb show
    52:54:00:ae:2a:e0 dev vxln100 dst 172.16.21.150 self permanent
    d2:ca:78:bb:7c:9b dev vxln100 permanent
    90:e2:ba:3f:ce:34 dev swp2s1.100
    90:e2:ba:3f:ce:35 dev swp2s0.100
    44:38:39:00:48:0e dev swp2s1.100 permanent
    44:38:39:00:48:0d dev swp2s0.100 permanent

## Persistent VXLAN Configuration in NSX

If you want your VXLAN configuration to 
[persist across upgrades of Cumulus Linux](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Installation-Upgrading-and-Package-Management/Managing-Cumulus-Linux-Disk-Images/Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux/#upgrading-cumulus-linux-devices-strategies-and-processes),
you need to include the following items in the persistent configuration.
Use `scp` to copy the files to `/mnt/persist`:

  - `/usr/share/openvswitch/ovs-ctl-vtep`
  - Certificates and key pairs, as above
  - `/etc/default/openvswitch-vtep`
  - The `ovsdb` database file; the default is
    `/var/lib/openvswitch/conf.db`
    
    {{%notice note%}}
    
Copying the `ovsdb` database file is optional; the persistent
    database file helps to speed up convergence on a system upgrade. NSX
    Manager pushes any configuration created or changed in NSX Manager
    when the connection with the VTEP is reestablished, which overwrites
    the database file.
    
    {{%/notice%}}

## Troubleshooting VXLANs in NSX

Use `ovsdb-client dump` to troubleshoot issues on the switch. It
verifies that the controller and switch handshake is successful. This
command works only for VXLANs integrated with NSX:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ovsdb-client dump -f list | grep -A 7 "Manager"
    Manager table
    _uuid               : 505f32af-9acb-4182-a315-022e405aa479
    inactivity_probe    : 30000
    is_connected        : true
    max_backoff         : []
    other_config        : {}
    status              : {sec_since_connect="18223", sec_since_disconnect="18225", state=ACTIVE}
    target              : "ssl:192.168.100.17:6632"
