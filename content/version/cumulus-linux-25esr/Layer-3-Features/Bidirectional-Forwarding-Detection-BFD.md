*Bidirectional Forwarding Detection* (BFD) provides low overhead and
rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It
provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and
protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or
multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional
path failure detection.

Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.

## Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths

BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two
systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single
hop sessions. Here are some best practices for using multihop paths:

  - **Spoofing:** To avoid spoofing with multihop paths, configure
    `max_hop_cnt` (maximum hop count*)* for each peer, which limits the
    number of hops for a BFD session. All BFD packets exceeding the max
    hop count will be dropped.
  - **Demultiplexing:** Since multihop BFD sessions can take arbitrary
    paths, demultiplex the initial BFD packet based on the
    source/destination IP address pair. Use Quagga, which monitors
    connectivity to the peer, to determine the source/destination IP
    address pairs.

Multihop BFD sessions are supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 peers. See
below for more details.

## BFD Parameters

You can configure the following BFD parameters for both IPv4 and IPv6
sessions:

  - The required minimum interval between the received BFD control
    packets.
  - The minimum interval for transmitting BFD control packets.
  - The detection time multiplier.

## Configuring BFD

You configure BFD one of two ways: by specifying the configuration in
the [PTM `topology.dot` file](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Prescriptive-Topology-Manager-PTM),
or using
[Quagga](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-3-Features/Quagga-Overview).

The [Quagga CLI](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-3-Features/Configuring-Quagga/#using-the-vtysh-modal-cli) 
can track IPv4 and IPv6 peer connectivity — both single hop and multihop, 
and both link-local IPv6 peers and global IPv6 peers — using BFD sessions 
without needing the `topology.dot` file. Use Quagga to register multihop 
peers with PTM and BFD as well as for monitoring the connectivity to the
remote BGP multihop peer. Quagga can dynamically register and unregister
both IPv4 and IPv6 peers with BFD when the BFD-enabled peer connectivity
is established or de-established, respectively. Also, you can configure
BFD parameters for each BGP or OSPF peer using Quagga.

{{%notice note%}}

The BFD parameter configured in the topology file is given higher
precedence over the client-configured BFD parameters for a BFD session
that has been created by both topology file and client (Quagga).

### BFD in BGP

For Quagga when using **BGP**, neighbors are registered and
de-registered with
[PTM](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Prescriptive-Topology-Manager-PTM)
dynamically when you enable BFD in BGP:

    quagga(config)# router bgp X
    quagga(config-router)# neighbor <neighbor ip> bfd

You can configure BFD parameters for each BGP neighbor. For example:

    null

To see neighbor information in BGP, including BFD status, run `show bgp
neighbors <IP address>`.

    quagga# show bgp neighbors 12.12.12.1
    BGP neighbor is 12.12.12.1, remote AS 65001, local AS 65000, external link

### BFD in OSPF

For Quagga using **OSFP**, neighbors are registered and de-registered
dynamically with
[PTM](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Prescriptive-Topology-Manager-PTM)
when you enable or disable BFD in OSPF. A neighbor is registered with
BFD when two-way adjacency is established and deregistered when
adjacency goes down if the BFD is enabled on the interface. The BFD
configuration is per interface and any IPv4 and IPv6 neighbors
discovered on that interface inherit the configuration.

    quagga(config)# interface X
    quagga(config-if)# ipv6 ospf6 bfd
        <2-255> Detect Multiplier
        <cr>
    quagga(config-if)# ipv6 ospf6 bfd 5
        <50-60000> Required min receive interval
    quagga(config-if)# ipv6 ospf6 bfd 5 500
        <50-60000> Desired min transmit interval
    quagga(config-if)# ipv6 ospf6 bfd 5 500 500
        <cr>
    quagga(config-if)# ipv6 ospf6 bfd 5 500 500

### OSPF Show Commands

or IPv4 OSPF interface or neighbor information.

## Troubleshooting BFD

To troubleshoot BFD, use `ptmctl -b`. For more information, see
[Prescriptive Topology Manager - PTM](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/Layer-1-and-Layer-2-Features/Prescriptive-Topology-Manager-PTM).
