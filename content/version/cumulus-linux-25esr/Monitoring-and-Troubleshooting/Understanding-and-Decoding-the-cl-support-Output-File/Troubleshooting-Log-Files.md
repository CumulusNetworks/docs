The only real unique entity for logging on Cumulus Linux compared to any
other Linux distribution is `switchd.log`, which logs the HAL (hardware
abstraction layer) from hardware like the Broadcom ASIC.

[This guide on NixCraft](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-log-files-location-and-how-do-i-view-logs-files/)
is amazing for understanding how `/var/log` works. The green highlighted
rows below are the most important logs and usually looked at first when
debugging.

|Log|Description|
|--- |--- |
|/var/log/alternatives.log|Information from the update-alternatives are logged into this log file.|
|/var/log/apt|Information the apt utility can send logs here; for example, from apt-get install and apt-get remove.|
|/var/log/audit/*|Contains log information stored by the Linux audit daemon, auditd.|
|/var/log/auth.log|Authentication logs. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/autoprovision|Logs output generated by running the zero touch provisioning script.|
|/var/log/boot.log|Contains information that is logged when the system boots.|
|/var/log/btmp|This file contains information about failed login attempts. Use the last command to view the btmp file. For example: `last -f /var/log/btmp | more`|
|/var/log/clagd.log|Logs status of the clagd service.|
|/var/log/cron.log|Log file for cron jobs. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/daemon.log|Contains information logged by the various background daemons that run on the system. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/debug|Debugging information. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/dmesg|Contains kernel ring buffer information. When the system boots up, it prints number of messages on the screen that display information about the hardware devices that the kernel detects during boot process. These messages are available in the kernel ring buffer and whenever a new message arrives, the old message gets overwritten. You can also view the content of this file using the dmesg command.|
|/var/log/dpkg.log|Contains information that is logged when a package is installed or removed using the dpkg command.|
|/var/log/faillog|Contains failed user login attempts. Use the faillog command to display the contents of this file.|
|/var/log/fsck/*|The fsck utility is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux filesystems.|
|/var/log/jdoo.log|jdoo is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system.|
|/var/log/kern.log|Logs produced by the kernel and handled by syslog. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/lastlog|Formats and prints the contents of the last login log file.|
|/var/log/lpr.log|Printer logs. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/mail.log|Mail server logs. Also includes mail.err, mail.info and mail.warn. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/messages|General messages and system-related information. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/news/*|The news command keeps you informed of news concerning the system. Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/ntpstats|Logs for network configuration protocol.|
|/var/log/openvswitch/*|ovsdb-server logs.|
|/var/log/quagga/*|Where Quagga logs to once enabled.|
|/var/log/switchd.log|The HAL log for Cumulus Linux.|
|/var/log/syslog|The main system log, which logs everything except auth-related messages.|
|/var/log/user.log|Note that Cumulus Linux does not write to this log file; but because it's a standard file, Cumulus Linux creates it as a zero length file.|
|/var/log/watchdog|Hardware watchdog log files.|
|/var/log/wtmp|Login records file.|
