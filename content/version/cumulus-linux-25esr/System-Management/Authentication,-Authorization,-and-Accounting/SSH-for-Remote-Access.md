You use [SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) to securely
access a Cumulus Linux switch remotely.

## Access Using Passkey (Basic Setup)

Cumulus Linux uses the openSSH package to provide SSH functionality. The
standard mechanisms of generating passwordless access just applies. The
example below has the cumulus user on a machine called
management-station connecting to a switch called *cumulus-switch1.*

First, on management-station, generate the SSH keys:

    cumulus@management-station:~$ ssh-keygen
       Generating public/private rsa key pair.
       Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa):
       Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
       Enter same passphrase again:
       Your identification has been saved in /home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa.
       Your public key has been saved in /home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
       The key fingerprint is:
       8c:47:6e:00:fb:13:b5:07:b4:1e:9d:f4:49:0a:77:a9 cumulus@management-station
       The key's randomart image is:
       +--[ RSA 2048]----+
       |    .  .= o o.   |
       |     o . O *..   |
       |    . o = =.o    |
       |     . O oE      |
       |      + S        |
       |       +         |
       |                 |
       |                 |
       |                 |
       +-----------------+

Next, append the public key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` into
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in the target userâ€™s home directory:

    cumulus@management-station:~$ scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub cumulus@cumulus-switch1:.ssh/authorized_keys
        Enter passphrase for key '/home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa':
        id_rsa.pub

Remember, you cannot use the root account to SSH to a switch in Cumulus
Linux unless you 
[set a password](/version/cumulus-linux-25esr/System-Management/Authentication-Authorization-and-Accounting/User-Accounts)
for the account.

### Completely Passwordless System

When generating the passphrase and its associated keys, as in the first
step above, do not enter a passphrase. Follow all the other
instructions.
