## Welcome to Cumulus Networks

We are transforming networking with Cumulus Linux, the industry's first,
full-featured Linux operating system for networking hardware. Cumulus
Linux is a complete network operating system, based on 
[Debian wheezy](http://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/). Unlike traditional
embedded platforms, Cumulus Linux provides a complete environment
pre-installed with scripting languages, server utilities, and monitoring
tools. Management tasks are accomplished via SSH using standard Linux
commands or over a serial console connection.
