## Welcome to Cumulus Networks

We are transforming networking with Cumulus Linux, the industry's first,
full-featured Linux operating system for networking hardware. Cumulus
Linux is a complete network operating system, based on [Debian
Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/) and Linux kernel 4.1.
Unlike traditional embedded platforms, Cumulus Linux provides a complete
environment pre-installed with scripting languages, server utilities,
and monitoring tools. Management tasks are accomplished via SSH using
standard Linux commands or over a serial console connection.
