This chapter covers configuring VXLAN gateways using a loopback cable
(which we call a *hyperloop*) on non-RIOT (VXLAN routing) capable ASICs
running Cumulus Linux.

The Broadcom Trident II and Tomahawk ASICs have a limitation where a L2
bridge that contains a VXLAN interface can not also have an IP address
assigned to it. This is an expected limitation with this ASIC, because
of the ordering of the decapsulation. A packet that is decapsulated will
already have passed the portion of the ASIC capable of reading the IP
address lookup (for example, VXLAN lookup happens before IP address
lookup). As of Cumulus Linux 3.2.1 even ASICs that are capable of VXLAN
routing (such as the Broadcom Trident II+ or Mellanox Spectrum) also
require a hyperloop. Please contact your [sales
team](mailto:sales@cumulusnetworks.com) if there is any confusion. Refer
to the [Cumulus Networks Hardware Compatibility List](https://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl) to
determine which ASIC is running on the switch.

**This limitation will not exist in future ASICs.** For example, the
Trident II+ has the [RIOT (Routing In/Out of
Tunnels)](https://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=s907324)
feature.

{{%notice warning%}}

RIOT and VXLAN Routing are not supported in Cumulus Linux 3.2.1, and
requires a hyperloop.

{{%/notice%}}

**Why would you need a hyperloop?**

<span style="color: #222222;"> Without native VXLAN routing support,
external gateways, firewalls or routers are attached to a VTEP do the
routing. (see diagram below) </span>

It is very common in Network Virtualization environments for firewalls
to sit on internal VXLAN tied VLANs as well as external VLANs that are
routed out to the internet. Look at the following illustration as an
example of this method. No special configuration is needed on the switch
because the firewall acts as the gateway between internal (VLAN20 /
VNI-20 in the example) and the routable external VLAN 10. VLAN10 could
have a SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) configured to route out of the
VLAN. This also has the benefit of where a VXLAN represents a tenant (or
purposely separated application) to keep the firewall between VXLANs so
that traffic can be filtered and sanitized to the network operators
specification.

<span style="color: #222222;"> With integrated VXLAN routing and
bridging using a hyperloop: </span>

  - <span style="color: #222222;"> One can avoid having to use external
    gateways/routers. A hyperloop gives you the ability to do integrated
    VXLAN routing on a non-RIOT (VXLAN routing) ASIC. </span>

  - <span style="color: #222222;"> If applications are hosted on the
    switch and need L3 connectivity, then a hyperloop can be used as
    well to provide reachability for this application.. </span>

<span style="color: #222222;"> **When not to use a hyperloop** </span>

  - If external firewall is used for routing and security (as shown
    above), then there is no need for external loopback as firewall
    takes care of routing across subnets.

  - If bandwidth for traffic to be routed is huge that we cannot
    provision such a high bandwidth using a hyperloop, then one should
    have dedicated gateways connected to exit leafs.

  - <span style="color: #222222;"> </span> If north-south routing
    involves edge router functionality, then that functionality cannot
    be provided by leaf switches and so it requires dedicated edge
    gateways to achieve the same, like NAT.

## Exiting a VXLAN with a Hyperloop</span>

### </span>

This limitation means a physical cable must be attached from one port on
leaf1 to another port on leaf1. One port is an L3 port while the other
is a member of the bridge. For example, following the configuration
above, in order for a layer 3 address to be used as the gateway for
vni-10, you could configure the following on exit01:

    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
     address 10.0.0.11/32
     
    ***some output removed for brevity (e.g. peerlink and host facing bonds)***
     
    auto bridge
    iface bridge
      bridge-vlan-aware yes
      bridge-ports inside server01 server02 vni-10 vni-20 peerlink

### Trident II and Tomahawk switchd Flag</span>

For the Broadcom Trident II and Tomahawk ASICs to be able to have a
hyperloop work correctly, you must configure a `switchd` flag. This
change is not needed on any other hardware ASIC.

    cumulus@exit01:mgmt-vrf:/root$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/switchd.conf
    hal.bcm.per_vlan_router_mac_lookup = TRUE

Restart `switchd` for the change to take place:

    cumulus@exit01:mgmt-vrf:/root$ sudo systemctl restart switchd.service

{{%notice warning%}}

Restarting `switchd` is a disruptive change and affects data plane
network traffic.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice warning%}}

Turning on the `hal.bcm.per_vlan_router_mac_lookup = TRUE` will limit
the Trident 2 switch to a configurable 512 local IP addresses (SVIs,
etc) so this should only be used as a last resort. This is only a
limitation on this specific ASIC type.

## VXLAN Routing and Hyperloop Troubleshooting Matrix</span>

  - **Are you running an ASIC capable of VXLAN?**  
      
    Must be running one of the following:
    
      - Broadcom Trident 2
    
      - Broadcom Trident 2+
    
      - Broadcom Tomahawk
    
      - Mellanox Spectrum  
          
        If you are unsure use a "net show system" as displayed in the
        following step. If you don't have an ASIC capable of VXLAN you
        can't encapsulate or decapsulate VXLAN traffic.

  - **Are you running the newest code?** This guide and testing was done
    on Cumulus Linux 3.2.1. [Please upgrade the code on the Cumulus
    Linux
    system. ](/version/cumulus-linux-321/Installation-Management/Managing-Cumulus-Linux-Disk-Images/Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux)

    You must be running *eau8* as shown above under the Version column.
    If you are not running the right version of Quagga for EVPN [follow
    the directions
    here](/version/cumulus-linux-321/Network-Virtualization/Ethernet-Virtual-Private-Network-EVPN).

  - **Are HER (Head End Replication) entries being programmed into the
    bridge fdb table?**  
    Check for 00:00:00:00:00:00 entries per VXLAN:
    
        cumulus@leaf03:mgmt-vrf:~$ bridge fdb show | grep 00:00:00:00:00:00

    If you are not getting HER entries, there is several things you can
    try:
    
      - Make sure you are using LNV **OR** EVPN. You can only use one or
        the other, not both at the same time.
    
      - Make sure you are not trying to use any VNI/VXLAN values over
        65535. For example, VXLAN 70000 is not supported in Cumulus
        Linux 3.2.1.
    
      - Make sure you are not using the reserved VLAN range, by default
        this is 3000-3999. The value can be seen in
        `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` for the `resv_vlan_range` variable.

  - **If you are using an MLAG VTEP (dual attached), is it set up
    correctly?  
    **Check the outputs. Often, when VXLAN is considered to be
    non-working, it's actually due to an incorrect setup on the server
    OS, whether it's Ubuntu, Microsoft Windows or RHEL.
    
    {{% imgOld 2 %}}

  - **Can you ping from host to host on the same VXLAN?  
    **For example, in the following network diagram, can server01 ping
    to server03 on any of the VLANs (VLAN1, VLAN100, VLAN200)?  
    
    {{% imgOld 3 %}}
    
      
    If you can't even ping from server to server this is not a VXLAN
    gateway problem, but a problem with the network itself. This must be
    fixed prior to making a VXLAN gateway with or without a hyperloop.
    
    {{%notice warning%}}
    
    Only proceed past this point if you can get server to server
    connectivity on the same VXLAN
    
    {{%/notice%}}

  - **Are you on a Broadcom** **Trident II?**  
    If and only if you are using a switch with a Broadcom Trident II
    ASIC, you must set the `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` flag for
    `hal.bcm.per_vlan_router_mac_lookup = TRUE` and restart `switchd`.

  - **Is the SVI on a physical interface or on a traditional bridge?  
    **
    
    {{%notice warning%}}
    
    The SVI (Switch VLAN interface) IP address for a hyperloop MUST be
    on a traditional bridge. Please follow the configuration guidelines
    on the above.
    
    {{%/notice%}}

  - **Is the port plugged in where it is supposed to be plugged in?**  
    Use `lldpctl` or `net show lldp` to see what ports are hooked up.
    
        cumulus@leaf03:mgmt-vrf:~$ net show lldp
        Local Port    Speed    Mode                 Remote Port        Remote  Host     Summary

        swp54         40G      NotConfigured  ====  swp53              leaf03
    
    Notice above that swp53 and swp54 are a loopback cable (hyperloop)
    where it is connected to itself.

  - **Is the VRR MAC address unique per subnet?**  
      
    Make sure that [VRR is configured
    correctly](/display/CL321/Virtual+Router+Redundancy+-+VRR) and that
    each MAC address is unique per VLAN.
