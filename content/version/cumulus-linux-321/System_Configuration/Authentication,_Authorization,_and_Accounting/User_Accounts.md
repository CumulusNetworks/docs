By default, Cumulus Linux has two user accounts: *cumulus* and *root*.

The *cumulus* account:

  - 
    
    <div id="src-5126751_indexterm-757B187115B258084C6BDA4995BC20C5">
    
    Default password is *CumulusLinux\!*
    
    </div>

  - Is a user account in the *sudo* group with sudo privileges

  - User can log in to the system via all the usual channels like
    console and
    [SSH](/version/cumulus-linux-321/System_Configuration/Authentication_Authorization_and_Accounting/SSH_for_Remote_Access)

  - Along with the cumulus group, has both show and edit rights for
    [NCLU](/version/cumulus-linux-321/System_Configuration/Network_Command_Line_Utility)

The *root* account:

  - Default password is disabled by default

  - Has the standard Linux root user access to everything on the switch

  - Disabled password prohibits login to the switch by SSH, telnet, FTP,
    and so forth

For best security, you should change the default password (using the
`passwd` command) before you configure Cumulus Linux on the switch.

You can add more user accounts as needed. Like the *cumulus* account,
these accounts must use `sudo` to [execute privileged
commands](/version/cumulus-linux-321/System_Configuration/Authentication_Authorization_and_Accounting/Using_sudo_to_Delegate_Privileges),
so be sure to include them in the *sudo* group.

To access the switch without any password requires [booting into a
single shell/user
mode](/version/cumulus-linux-321/Monitoring_and_Troubleshooting/Single_User_Mode_-_Boot_Recovery).

## <span>Enabling Remote Access for the root User</span>

As mentioned above, the root user does not have a password set for it,
and it cannot log in to a switch via SSH. This default account behavior
is consistent with Debian. In order to connect to a switch using the
root account, you can do one of two things for the account:

  - Generate an SSH key

  - Set a password

### <span id="src-5126751_UserAccounts-ssh_key" class="confluence-anchor-link"></span><span>Generating an SSH Key for the root Account</span>

1.  First, in a terminal on your host system (not the switch), check to
    see if a key already exists:
    
        root@host:~# ls -al ~/.ssh/
    
    The key is named something like `id_dsa.pub`, `id_rsa.pub` or
    `id_ecdsa.pub`.

2.  If a key doesn't exist, generate a new one by first creating the RSA
    key pair:
    
        root@host:~# ssh-keygen -t rsa

3.  A prompt appears, asking you to *Enter file in which to save the key
    (/root/.ssh/id\_rsa):*. Press Enter to use the root user's home
    directory, or else provide a different destination.

4.  You are prompted to *Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):*.
    This is optional but it does provide an extra layer of security.

5.  The public key is now located in `/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. The
    private key (identification) is now located in `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`.

6.  Copy the public key to the switch. SSH to the switch as the cumulus
    user, then run:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh
        cumulus@switch:~$ echo <SSH public key string> | sudo tee -a /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

### <span id="src-5126751_UserAccounts-root_passwd" class="confluence-anchor-link"></span><span>Setting the root User Password</span>

1.  Run:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo passwd root

2.  Change the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file's `PermitRootLogin` setting
    from *without-password* to *yes*.
    
    ``` 
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     
    ... 
          
    # Authentication:
    LoginGraceTime 120
    PermitRootLogin yes
    StrictModes yes
          
    ...  
    ```

3.  Restart the `ssh` service:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl reload ssh.service
