## Introducing Cumulus Linux

Cumulus Linux is the networking industry's first full-featured Linux
operating system. The [Debian
Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/)-based,
networking-focused distribution runs on hardware produced by a [broad
partner ecosystem](http://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/), ensuring unmatched
customer choice regarding silicon, optics, cables, and systems.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation covering installing
Cumulus Linux, system configuration and management, network solutions,
and monitoring and troubleshooting recommendations. In addition, the
quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process to get you
started with Cumulus Linux.

This documentation is current as of May 1, 2017 for version 3.2.1.
Please visit the [Cumulus Networks Web
site](http://docs.cumulusnetworks.com) for the most up to date

### What's New in Cumulus Linux 3.2.1

Cumulus Linux 3.2.1 adds these new features and platforms, including:

  - **Network Command Line Utility**: We've improved the syntax so it's
    even easier for network operators to configure Cumulus Linux with
    [NCLU](/version/cumulus-linux-321/System-Configuration/Network-Command-Line-Utility).
  - **Platform Independent Multicast (PIM)**: We've improved [multicast
    latency](/version/cumulus-linux-321/Layer-Three/Protocol-Independent-Multicast-PIM)
    on Mellanox switches.
  - **Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)**: We've expanded support
    for
    [ECN](Buffer-and-Queue-Management.html#src-5127004_BufferandQueueManagement-ecn)
    to Tomahawk switches.
  - **New 100G platform**: Early access support for the [Edge-Core
    AS7412-32X](https://cumulusnetworks.com/HCL), which uses the
    Mellanox Spectrum ASIC.
