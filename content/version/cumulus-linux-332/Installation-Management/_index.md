A Cumulus Linux switch can have only one image of the operating system
installed. This section discusses installing new and updating existing
Cumulus Linux disk images, and configuring those images with additional
applications (via packages) if desired.

Zero touch provisioning is a way to quickly deploy and configure new
switches in a large-scale environment.
