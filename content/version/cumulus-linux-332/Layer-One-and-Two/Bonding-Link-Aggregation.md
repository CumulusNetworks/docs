Linux bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network
interfaces (*slaves*) into a single logical bonded interface (*bond*).
Cumulus Linux supports two bonding modes:

  - The IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation mode, which allows one or more
    links to be aggregated together to form a *link aggregation group*
    (LAG), such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the
    link aggregation group as if it were a single link.
  - The balance-xor mode, where the bonding of slave interfaces are
    static and all slave interfaces are active for load balancing and
    fault tolerance purposes. This is useful for
    [MLAG](/version/cumulus-linux-332/Layer-One-and-Two/Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG)
    deployments.

The benefits of link aggregation include:

  - Linear scaling of bandwidth as links are added to LAG
  - Load balancing
  - Failover protection

Cumulus Linux uses version 1 of the LAG control protocol (LACP).

To temporarily bring up a bond even when there is no LACP partner, use
[LACP Bypass](/version/cumulus-linux-332/Layer-One-and-Two/LACP-Bypass).

## Hash Distribution

Egress traffic through a bond is distributed to a slave based on a
packet hash calculation, providing load balancing over the slaves; many
conversation flows are distributed over all available slaves to load
balance the total traffic. Traffic for a single conversation flow always
hashes to the same slave.

The hash calculation uses packet header data to pick which slave to
transmit the packet to:

  - For IP traffic, IP header source and destination fields are used in
    the calculation.
  - For IP + TCP/UDP traffic, source and destination ports are included
    in the hash calculation.

{{%notice note%}}

In a failover event, the hash calculation is adjusted to steer traffic
over available slaves.

## Creating a Bond

Bonds can be created and configured using the Network Command Line
Utility
([NCLU](/version/cumulus-linux-332/System-Configuration/Network-Command-Line-Utility)).
Follow the steps below to create a new bond:

1.  SSH into the switch.

2.  Add a bond using the `net add bond` command, replacing `[bond-name]`
    with the name of the bond, and `[slaves]` with the list of slaves:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ net add bond [bond-name] bond slaves [slaves]
        cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
        cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

{{%notice note%}}

The name of the bond must be:

  - Compliant with Linux interface naming conventions.
  - Unique within the switch.

### Configuration Options

The configuration options, and their default values, are listed in the
table below.

{{%notice note%}}

Each bond configuration option, except for `bond slaves,` is set to the
recommended value by default in Cumulus Linux. They should only be
configured if a different setting is needed. For more information on
configuration values, refer to the Related Information section below.

### Enabling balance-xor Mode

When you enable *balance-xor mode*, the bonding of slave interfaces are
static and all slave interfaces are active for load balancing and fault
tolerance purposes. Packet transmission on the bond is based on the hash
policy specified by `xmit-hash-policy`.

When using balance-xor mode to dual-connect host-facing bonds in an
[MLAG](/version/cumulus-linux-332/Layer-One-and-Two/Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG)
environment, the `clag-id` parameter **must** be configured on the MLAG
bonds and must be the same on both MLAG switches. Otherwise, the bonds
are treated by the MLAG switch pair as if they were single-connected.

{{%notice note%}}

You should use balance-xor mode **only** if you cannot use LACP for some
reason, as LACP can detect mismatched link attributes among bond members
and can even detect misconnections.

{{%/notice%}}

In order to change the mode of an existing bond, you must first delete
the bond, then recreate it with the balance-xor mode. Assuming the bond
doesn't exist on the host, you can configure it as follows:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bond bond1 bond slaves swp3,4
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bond bond1 bond mode balance-xor
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

These commands create the following configuration in the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file:

    auto bond1
    iface bond1
        bond-mode balance-xor
        bond-slaves swp3 swp4

To view the bond, use
[NCLU](/version/cumulus-linux-332/System-Configuration/Network-Command-Line-Utility):

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show interface bond1

## Example Configuration: Bonding 4 Slaves

In the following example, the front panel port interfaces swp1-swp4 are
slaves in bond0, while swp5 and swp6 are not part of bond0.

{{% imgOld 0 %}}

{{%notice info%}}

**Example Bond Configuration**

The following commands create a bond with four slaves:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bond bond0 address 10.0.0.1/30
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bond bond0 bond slaves swp1-4
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

These commands create this code snippet in the `/etc/network/interfaces`
file:

    auto bond0
    iface bond0
        address 10.0.0.1/30
        bond-slaves swp1 swp2 swp3 swp4

{{%notice info%}}

If you are intending that the bond become part of a bridge, you don't
need to specify an IP address.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%/notice%}}

When networking is started on switch, bond0 is created as MASTER and
interfaces swp1-swp4 come up in SLAVE mode, as seen in the `ip link
show` command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ ip link show
    ...
     
    3: swp1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 500
        link/ether 44:38:39:00:03:c1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    4: swp2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 500
        link/ether 44:38:39:00:03:c1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    5: swp3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 500
        link/ether 44:38:39:00:03:c1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    6: swp4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 500
        link/ether 44:38:39:00:03:c1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
     
    ...
     
    55: bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT
        link/ether 44:38:39:00:03:c1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

{{%notice note%}}

All slave interfaces within a bond have the same MAC address as the
bond. Typically, the first slave added to the bond donates its MAC
address as the bond MAC address, while the other slaves’ MAC addresses
are set to the bond MAC address.

The bond MAC address is used as source MAC address for all traffic
leaving the bond, and provides a single destination MAC address to
address traffic to the bond.

{{%/notice%}}

## Caveats and Errata

  - An interface cannot belong to multiple bonds.
  - A bond can have subinterfaces, but not the other way around.
  - A bond cannot enslave VLAN subinterfaces.
  - Slave ports within a bond should all be set to the same
    speed/duplex, and should match the link partner’s slave ports.
