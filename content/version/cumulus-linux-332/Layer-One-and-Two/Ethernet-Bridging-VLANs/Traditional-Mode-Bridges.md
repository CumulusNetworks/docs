Cumulus Networks recommends you use a 
[VLAN-aware bridge](/version/cumulus-linux-332/Layer-One-and-Two/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode-for-Large-scale-Layer-2-Environments)
on your switch. You use traditional mode bridges only if you need to run
more than one bridge on the switch or if you need to use PVSTP+.

## Creating a Traditional Mode Bridge

You configure traditional mode bridges in `/etc/network/interfaces`
file. To create a traditional mode bridge:

1.  Open the `/etc/network/interfaces` file in a text editor.

2.  Add a new stanza to create the bridge, and save the file. The
    example below creates a bridge with STP enabled and the MAC address
    ageing timer configured to a lower value than the default:
    
        auto my_bridge
        iface my_bridge
            bridge-ports bond0 swp5 swp6
            bridge-ageing 150
            bridge-stp on
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 33%" />
    <col style="width: 33%" />
    <col style="width: 33%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Configuration Option</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    <th><p>Default Value</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>bridge-ports</p></td>
    <td><p>List of logical and physical ports belonging to the logical bridge.</p></td>
    <td><p>N/A</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>bridge-ageing</p></td>
    <td><p>Maximum amount of time before a MAC addresses learned on the bridge expires from the bridge MAC cache.</p></td>
    <td><p>300 seconds</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>bridge-stp</p></td>
    <td><p>Enables spanning tree protocol on this bridge. The default spanning tree mode is Per VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (PVRST).</p>
    <p>For more information on spanning-tree configurations see the configuration section: <a href="/version/cumulus-linux-332/Layer-One-and-Two/Spanning-Tree-and-Rapid-Spanning-Tree">Spanning Tree and Rapid Spanning Tree</a>.</p></td>
    <td><p>off</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    {{%notice note%}}

The name of the bridge must be:

- Compliant with Linux interface naming conventions.
- Unique within the switch.

    {{%notice warning%}}

Do not try to bridge the management port, eth0, with any switch
ports (like swp0, swp1, and so forth). For example, if you created a
bridge with eth0 and swp1, it will **not** work.

    {{%/notice%}}

3.  Reload the network configuration using the `ifreload` command:
    
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a

{{%notice info%}}

You can configure multiple bridges, in order to logically divide a
switch into multiple layer 2 domains. This allows for hosts to
communicate with other hosts in the same domain, while separating them
from hosts in other domains.

{{%notice info%}}

You can create only one VLAN-aware bridge on a switch.

{{%/notice%}}

The diagram below shows a multiple bridge configuration, where host-1
and host-2 are connected to bridge-A, while host-3 and host-4 are
connected to bridge-B. This means that:

  - host-1 and host-2 can communicate with each other.
  - host-3 and host-4 can communicate with each other.
  - host-1 and host-2 cannot communicate with host-3 and host-4.

{{<figure src ="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev.docs.cumulusnetworks.com/images/download/attachments/5868987/multiple-bridges.png" >}}

This example configuration looks like this in the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file:

    auto bridge-A
    iface bridge-A
        bridge-ports swp1 swp2
        bridge-stp on
     
    auto bridge-B
    iface bridge-B
        bridge-ports swp3 swp4
        bridge-stp on

## Using Trunks in Traditional Bridge Mode

The [IEEE standard](http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html) for
trunking is 802.1Q. The 802.1Q specification adds a 4 byte header within
the Ethernet frame that identifies the VLAN of which the frame is a
member.

802.1Q also identifies an *untagged* frame as belonging to the *native*
VLAN (most network devices default their native VLAN to 1). The concept
of native, non-native, tagged or untagged has generated confusion due to
mixed terminology and vendor-specific implementations. Some
clarification is in order:

  - A *trunk port* is a switch port configured to send and receive
    802.1Q tagged frames.
  - A switch sending an untagged (bare Ethernet) frame on a trunk port
    is sending from the native VLAN defined on the trunk port.
  - A switch sending a tagged frame on a trunk port is sending to the
    VLAN identified by the 802.1Q tag.
  - A switch receiving an untagged (bare Ethernet) frame on a trunk port
    places that frame in the native VLAN defined on the trunk port.
  - A switch receiving a tagged frame on a trunk port places that frame
    in the VLAN identified by the 802.1Q tag.

A bridge in traditional mode has no concept of trunks, just tagged or
untagged frames. With a trunk of 200 VLANs, there would need to be 199
bridges, each containing a tagged physical interface, and one bridge
containing the native untagged VLAN. See the examples below for more
information.

{{%notice note%}}

The interaction of tagged and un-tagged frames on the same trunk often
leads to undesired and unexpected behavior. A switch that uses VLAN 1
for the native VLAN may send frames to a switch that uses VLAN 2 for the
native VLAN, thus merging those two VLANs and their spanning tree state.

### Trunk Example

{{% imgOld 1 %}}

To create the above example, add the following configuration to the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file:

    auto br-VLAN100
    iface br-VLAN100
     bridge-ports swp1.100 swp2.100
     bridge-stp on
     
     
    auto br-VLAN200
    iface br-VLAN200
     bridge-ports swp1.200 swp2.200
     bridge-stp on

### VLAN Tagging Examples

You can find more examples of VLAN tagging in 
[this chapter](/version/cumulus-linux-332/Layer-One-and-Two/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-Tagging).

### Configuring ARP Timers

Cumulus Linux does not often interact directly with end systems as much
as end systems interact with one another. Thus, after a successful
[address resolution protocol](http://linux-ip.net/html/ether-arp.html)
(ARP) places a neighbor into a reachable state, Cumulus Linux may not
interact with the client again for a long enough period of time for the
neighbor to move into a stale state. To keep neighbors in the reachable
state, Cumulus Linux includes a background process
(`/usr/bin/arp_refresh`) that tracks neighbors that move into a stale,
delay or probe state, and attempts to refresh their state ahead of any
removal from the Linux kernel, and thus before it would be removed from
the hardware forwarding.

The ARP refresh timer defaults to 14400 seconds (4 hours). You can
change this setting by following the procedures outlined in this
[knowledge base article](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/202012933).
