Before you install Cumulus Linux, the switch can be in two different
states:

- The switch has no image on it (so the switch is only running
    [ONIE](http://www.onie.org/)) or you desire or require a clean
    installation. In this case, you can install Cumulus Linux in one of
    the following ways, using:
- [DHCP/a web server with DHCP options](#installing-via-a-dhcp-web-server-method-without-dhcp-options)
- [DHCP/a web server without DHCP options](#installing-via-a-web-server-with-no-dhcp)
- [A web server with no DHCP](#installing-via-a-dhcp-web-server-method-without-dhcp-options)
- [FTP or TFTP without a web server](#installing-via-ftp-or-tftp-without-a-web-server)
- [Local file installation](#installing-via-a-local-file)
- [USB](#installing-via-usb)
- The switch already has Cumulus Linux installed on it, so you only need to 
  [upgrade it](/version/cumulus-linux-343/Installation-Management/Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux).

{{%notice tip%}}

[ONIE](http://www.onie.org/) is an open source project, equivalent to
PXE on servers, that enables the installation of network operating
systems (NOS) on bare metal switches.

## Understanding these Examples

The sections in this chapter are ordered from the most repeatable to the
least repeatable methods. For instance, DHCP can scale to hundreds of
switch installs with zero manual input, compared to something like USB
installs. Installing via USB is fine for a single switch here and there
but is not scalable.

- You can name your Cumulus Linux installer binary using any of the
  [ONIE naming schemes mentioned here](https://opencomputeproject.github.io/onie/design-spec/discovery.html#default-file-name-search-order).
- In the examples below, \[PLATFORM\] can be any supported Cumulus
    Linux platform, such as *x86\_64*, or *arm*.

## Installing via a DHCP/Web Server Method with DHCP Options

Installing Cumulus Linux in this manner is as simple as setting up a
DHCP/web server on your laptop and connecting the eth0 management port
of the switch to your laptop.

Once you connect the cable, the installation proceeds as follows:

1. The bare metal switch boots up and asks for an address (DHCP
    request).

2. The DHCP server acknowledges and responds with DHCP option 114 and
    the location of the installation image.

3. ONIE downloads the Cumulus Linux binary, installs and reboots.

4. Success\! You are now running Cumulus Linux.

    {{% imgOld 0 %}}

{{%notice note%}}

The most common method is for you to send DHCP option 114 with the
entire URL to the web server (this could be the same system). However,
there are many other ways to use DHCP even if you don't have full
control over DHCP. 
[See the ONIE user guide](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/onie/wiki/Design-Spec-SW-Image-Discovery#partial-installer-urls)
for help.

{{%/notice%}}

Here's an example DHCP configuration with an [ISC DHCP
server](http://www.isc.org/downloads/dhcp/):

    subnet 172.0.24.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
      range 172.0.24.20 172.0.24.200;
      option default-url = "http://172.0.24.14/onie-installer-[PLATFORM]";
    }

Here's an example DHCP configuration with
[dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) (static address
assignment):

    dhcp-host=sw4,192.168.100.14,6c:64:1a:00:03:ba,set:sw4
    dhcp-option=tag:sw4,114,"http://roz.rtplab.test/onie-installer-[PLATFORM]"

If you don't have a web server, you can use 
[this free Apache example](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

## Installing via a DHCP/Web Server Method without DHCP Options

If you have a laptop on the same network and the switch can pull DHCP
from the corporate network, but you cannot modify DHCP options (maybe
it's controlled by another team), do the following:

1. Place the Cumulus Linux binary in a directory on the web server.

2. Run the installer manually, since DHCP options can't be modified,
    either from ONIE or the Cumulus Linux command prompt.

    - From ONIE, run the `onie-nos-install` command:

            ONIE:/ #onie-nos-install http://10.0.1.251/path/to/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin

    - From Cumulus Linux, run the `onie-install` command:

            cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-install -a -i http://10.0.1.251/path/to/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin && sudo reboot

## Installing via a Web Server with no DHCP

If your laptop is on the same network as the switch eth0 interface but
no DHCP server is available, you can still install directly from Cumulus
Linux or using ONIE.

### Installing from Cumulus Linux

From Cumulus Linux, run the `onie-install` command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-install -a -i http://10.0.1.251/path/to/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin && sudo reboot

### Installing from ONIE

Do the following steps to run the install using ONIE. Note that ONIE is in 
[*discovery mode*](http://opencomputeproject.github.io/onie/design-spec/discovery.html#installer-discovery-methods):

1. To disable discovery mode, run:

        onie# onie-discovery-stop

    or, on older ONIE versions if that command isn't supported:

        onie# /etc/init.d/discover.sh stop

2. Assign a static address to eth0 via ONIE (using `ip addr add`):

        ONIE:/ #ip addr add 10.0.1.252/24 dev eth0

3. Place the Cumulus Linux installer image in a directory on your web
    server.

4. Run the installer manually, since there are no DHCP options:

        ONIE:/ #onie-nos-install http://10.0.1.251/path/to/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin

## Installing via FTP or TFTP without a Web Server

If your laptop is on the same network as the switch eth0 interface but
no DHCP server is available, you can still install directly from Cumulus
Linux or using ONIE.

### Installing from Cumulus Linux

If you are not utilizing DHCP options, run one of the following commands
(`tftp` for TFTP or `ftp` for FTP), from the Cumulus Linux command
prompt:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-install -a -i ftp://local-ftp-server/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin && sudo reboot
     
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-install -a -i tftp://local-tftp-server/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin && sudo reboot

### Installing from ONIE

To install without DHCP options using ONIE, do the following:

1. Set up DHCP or static addressing for eth0, as in the examples above.

2. If you are utilizing static addressing, disable ONIE discovery mode.

3. Place the Cumulus Linux installer image into a TFTP or FTP
    directory.

4. If you are not utilizing DHCP options, run one of the following
    commands (`tftp` for TFTP or `ftp` for FTP):

        ONIE# onie-nos-install ftp://local-ftp-server/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin
         
        ONIE# onie-nos-install tftp://local-tftp-server/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin

## Installing via a Local File

You can still install referencing a local file, directly from Cumulus
Linux or using ONIE.

### Installing from Cumulus Linux

From Cumulus Linux, run the `onie-install` command:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-install -a -i /path/to/local/file/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin && sudo reboot

### Installing from ONIE

1. Set up DHCP or static addressing for eth0, as in the examples above.

2. If you are utilizing static addressing, disable ONIE discovery mode.

3. Use [scp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy) to copy the
    Cumulus Linux binary to the switch.  
    **Note:** Windows users can use
    [WinScp](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php).

4. Run the installer manually from ONIE:

        ONIE:/ #onie-nos-install /path/to/local/file/cumulus-install-[PLATFORM].bin

## Installing via USB

Following the steps below produces a clean installation of Cumulus
Linux. This wipes out all pre-existing configuration files that may be
present on the switch. Instructions are offered for x86 and ARM
platforms, and also cover the installation of a license after the
software installation.

{{%notice note%}}

Make sure to [back up](/version/cumulus-linux-343/Installation-Management/Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux)
any important configuration files that you may need to restore the
configuration of your switch after the installation finishes.

{{%/notice%}}

### Preparing for USB Installation

1. Download the appropriate Cumulus Linux image for your x86 or ARM
    platform from the [Cumulus Networks Downloads
    page](http://cumulusnetworks.com/downloads/).

2. 

    Prepare your flash drive by formatting in one of the supported
    formats: FAT32, vFAT or EXT2.

    {{%/notice%}}
    
    {{%notice warning%}}

When using a Mac or Windows computer to rename the installation file
    the file extension may still be present. Make sure to remove the
    file extension otherwise ONIE will not be able to detect the file\!

4. Insert the USB stick into the switch, then continue with the
    appropriate instructions below for your x86 or ARM platform.

### Instructions for x86 Platforms

<details>
<summary>Click to expand x86 instructions... </summary>

1. Prepare the switch for installation:

   - If the switch is offline, connect to the console and power on
        the switch.

   - If the switch is already online in Cumulus Linux, connect to the
        console and reboot the switch into the ONIE environment with the
        `sudo onie-select -i` command, followed by `sudo reboot`. Then
        skip to step 4 below.

   - If the switch is already online in ONIE, use the `reboot`
        command.

    {{%notice note%}}

SSH sessions to the switch get dropped after this step. To complete
    the remaining instructions, connect to the console of the switch.
    Cumulus Linux switches display their boot process to the console, so
    you need to monitor the console specifically to complete the next
    step.

    {{%/notice%}}

2. Monitor the console and select the ONIE option from the first GRUB
    screen shown below.

    {{% imgOld 1 %}}

3. Cumulus Linux on x86 uses GRUB chainloading to present a second GRUB
    menu specific to the ONIE partition. No action is necessary in this
    menu to select the default option *ONIE: Install OS*.

    {{% imgOld 2 %}}

4. At this point, the USB drive should be automatically recognized and
    mounted. The image file should be located and automatic installation
    of Cumulus Linux should begin. Here is some sample output:

10. Check that your license is installed with the `cl-license` command.

11. Reboot the switch to utilize the new license.

        sudo reboot

## Installing a New Image when Cumulus Linux Is already Installed

At times it may be necessary to put the switch into ONIE in order to do
an install. This may be required when moving between major releases or
re-installing from an early version of 3.y.z. For more information, see
[Upgrading Cumulus Linux](/version/cumulus-linux-343/Installation-Management/Upgrading-Cumulus-Linux/#upgrading-via-binary-install-onie).

### Entering ONIE Mode from Cumulus Linux

If Cumulus Linux is already installed on the switch, you can enter ONIE
mode in one of two ways, using:

- ONIE Recovery Mode to manually install an image from the ONIE prompt:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-select -r
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo reboot

- ONIE Install Mode to attempt to automatically discover the image
    from a DHCP server:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo onie-select -i
        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo reboot
