## Introducing Cumulus Linux

Cumulus Linux is the networking industry's first full-featured Linux
operating system. The 
[Debian Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/)-based,
networking-focused distribution runs on hardware produced by a 
[broad partner ecosystem](http://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/), ensuring unmatched
customer choice regarding silicon, optics, cables, and systems.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation covering installing
Cumulus Linux, system configuration and management, network solutions,
and monitoring and troubleshooting recommendations. In addition, the
quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process to get you
started with Cumulus Linux.
