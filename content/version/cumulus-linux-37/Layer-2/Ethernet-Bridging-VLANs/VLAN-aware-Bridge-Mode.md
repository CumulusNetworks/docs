The Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one
that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge
model.

For [traditional Linux
bridges](../Traditional-Bridge-Mode/),
the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling
bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and,
for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN
subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges
in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state
management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes
large.

The VLAN-aware mode in Cumulus Linux implements a configuration model
for large-scale L2 environments, with **one single** **instance** of
[Spanning
Tree](../../Spanning-Tree-and-Rapid-Spanning-Tree/).
Each physical bridge member port is configured with the list of allowed
VLANs as well as its port VLAN ID (either PVID or native VLAN — see
below). MAC address learning, filtering and forwarding are *VLAN-aware*.
This significantly reduces the configuration size, and eliminates the
large overhead of managing the port/VLAN instances as subinterfaces,
replacing them with lightweight VLAN bitmaps and state updates.

{{%notice tip%}}

You can configure both VLAN-aware and traditional mode bridges on the
same network in Cumulus Linux; however you should not have more than one
VLAN-aware bridge on a given switch.

## Configure a VLAN-aware Bridge

VLAN-aware bridges can be configured with the Network Command Line
Utility
([NCLU](../../../System-Configuration/Network-Command-Line-Utility-NCLU/)).
The example below shows the NCLU commands required to create a
VLAN-aware bridge configured for STP, that contains two switch ports,
and includes 3 VLANs — the tagged VLANs 100 and 200 and the untagged
(native) VLAN of 1:

    bridge-pvid 1
    bridge-vids 100 200
    bridge-vlan-aware yes
 
...</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The following attributes are useful for configuring VLAN-aware bridges:

  - `bridge-vlan-aware`: Is automatically set to *yes* to indicate that
    the bridge is in VLAN-aware mode.

  - `bridge-pvid`: A PVID is the bridge's *Primary VLAN Identifer*. The
    PVID defaults to 1; specifying the PVID identifies that VLAN as the
    native VLAN.

  - `bridge-vids`: A VID is the *VLAN Identifier*, which declares the
    VLANs associated with this bridge.

  - `bridge-access`: Declares the physical switch port as an *access
    port*. Access ports ignore all tagged packets; put all untagged
    packets into the VLAN specified for this attribute. See the example
    [below](#untagged-access-ports).

  - `bridge-allow-untagged`: When set to *no*, it drops any untagged
    frames for a given switch port.

{{%notice tip%}}

If you specify `bridge-vids`, `bridge-access` or `bridge-pvid` at the
bridge level, these configurations are inherited by all ports in the
bridge. However, specifying any of these settings for a specific port
overrides the setting in the bridge.

{{%/notice%}}

For a definitive list of bridge attributes, run `ifquery --syntax-help`
and look for the entries under **bridge**, **bridgevlan** and
**mstpctl**.

{{%notice note%}}

The `bridge-pvid 1` is implied by default. You do not have to specify
`bridge-pvid` for a bridge or a port; in this case, the VLAN is
untagged. And while it does not hurt the configuration, it helps other
users for readability.

The following configurations are identical to each other and the
configuration above:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />

</tbody>
</table>

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice warning%}}

Do not try to bridge the management port, eth0, with any switch ports
(like swp0, swp1 and so forth). For example, if you created a bridge
with eth0 and swp1, it will not work properly and may disrupt access to
the management interface.

{{%/notice%}}

### Reserved VLAN Range

For hardware data plane internal operations, the switching silicon
requires VLANs for every physical port, Linux bridge, and layer 3
subinterface. Cumulus Linux reserves a range of 1000 VLANs by default;
the reserved range is 3000-3999.

{{%notice tip%}}

You can modify the reserved range if it conflicts with any user-defined
VLANs, as long the new range is a contiguous set of VLANs with IDs
anywhere between 2 and 4094, and the minimum size of the range is 300
VLANs.

{{%/notice%}}

To configure the reserved range:

1.  Open `/etc/cumulus/switchd.conf` in a text editor.

2.  Uncomment the following line, specify a new range, and save the
    file:

        resv_vlan_range

3.  Restart `switchd` to implement the change:

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl restart switchd.service

    {{%notice note%}}

While restarting `switchd`, all running ports will flap, and
    forwarding will be interrupted.

## Example Configurations

### VLAN Filtering/VLAN Pruning

By default, the bridge port inherits the bridge VIDs. A port's
configuration can override the bridge VIDs, by using the `bridge-vids`
attribute:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p> <div style="width:300px">{{% imgOld 1 %}}</p></td>
<td><pre><code>cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge ports swp1-3
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge vids 100,200
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge pvid 1
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp3 bridge vids 200
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
cumulus@switch:~$ net show configuration files
 
...
auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3
    bridge-pvid 1
    bridge-vids 100 200
    bridge-vlan-aware yes
 
auto swp3
iface swp3
  bridge-vids 200</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Untagged/Access Ports

Access ports ignore all tagged packets. In the configuration below, swp1
and swp2 are configured as access ports, while all untagged traffic goes
to VLAN 100, as specified in the example below:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>{{% imgOld 2 %}}</p></td>

cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge vids 100,200
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge pvid 1
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp1 bridge access 100
cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp2 bridge access 100
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending

iface swp1
    bridge-access 100
 
auto swp2
iface swp2
    bridge-access 100
...</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Drop Untagged Frames

With VLAN-aware bridge mode, you can configure a switch port to drop any
untagged frames. To do this, add `bridge-allow-untagged no` to the
**switch port** (not to the bridge). This leaves the bridge port without
a PVID and drops untagged packets.

Consider the following example bridge:

    auto bridge
    iface bridge
      bridge-ports swp1 swp2
      bridge-pvid 1
      bridge-vids 10 100 200
      bridge-vlan-aware yes

Here is the VLAN membership for that configuration:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show bridge vlan
     
    Interface      VLAN  Flags
    -----------  ------  ---------------------
    swp1              1  PVID, Egress Untagged
                    100
                    200
    swp2              1  PVID, Egress Untagged
                     10
                    100
                    200

To configure swp2 to drop untagged frames, add `bridge-allow-untagged
no`:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add interface swp2 bridge allow-untagged no

This command creates the following configuration snippet in the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file. Note the `bridge-allow-untagged`
configuration is under swp2:

    cumulus@switch:~$ cat /etc/network/interfaces
     
    ...
     
    auto swp1
    iface swp1
     
    auto swp2
    iface swp2
        bridge-allow-untagged no
     
    auto bridge
    iface bridge
      bridge-ports swp1 swp2
      bridge-pvid 1
      bridge-vids 10 100 200
      bridge-vlan-aware yes
     
    ...

When you check VLAN membership for that port, it shows that there is
**no** untagged VLAN.

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show bridge vlan
     
    Interface      VLAN  Flags
    -----------  ------  ---------------------
    swp1              1  PVID, Egress Untagged
                     10
                    100
                    200
    swp2             10
                    100
                    200

### VLAN Layer 3 Addressing — Switch Virtual Interfaces and Other VLAN Attributes

When configuring the VLAN attributes for the bridge, specify the
attributes for each VLAN interface, each of which is named
*vlan\<vlanid\>*. If you are configuring the SVI for the native VLAN,
you must declare the native VLAN and specify its IP address. Specifying
the IP address in the bridge stanza itself returns an error.

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 100 ip address 192.168.10.1/24
    cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 100 ipv6 address 2001:db8::1/32
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

These commands create the following configuration in the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file:

    auto bridge
    iface bridge
        bridge-ports swp1 swp2
        bridge-pvid 1
        bridge-vids 10 100 200
        bridge-vlan-aware yes
     
    auto vlan100
    iface vlan100
        address 192.168.10.1/24
        address 2001:db8::1/32
        vlan-id 100
        vlan-raw-device bridge

{{%notice note%}}

In the above configuration, if your switch is configured for multicast
routing, you do not need to specify `bridge-igmp-querier-src`, as there
is no need for a static IGMP querier configuration on the switch.
Otherwise, the static IGMP querier configuration helps to probe the
hosts to refresh their IGMP reports.

{{%/notice%}}

You can specify a range of VLANs as well. For example:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 1-200

### Configure ARP Timers

Cumulus Linux does not often interact directly with end systems as much
as end systems interact with one another. Thus, after a successful
[address resolution protocol](http://linux-ip.net/html/ether-arp.html)
(ARP) places a neighbor into a reachable state, Cumulus Linux may not
interact with the client again for a long enough period of time for the
neighbor to move into a stale state. To keep neighbors in the reachable
state, Cumulus Linux includes a background process
(`/usr/bin/neighmgrd`) that tracks neighbors that move into a stale,
delay or probe state, and attempts to refresh their state ahead of any
removal from the Linux kernel, and thus before it would be removed from
the hardware forwarding.

The ARP refresh timer defaults to 1080 seconds (18 minutes). You can
change this setting by following the procedures outlined in this
[knowledge base
article](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/202012933).

### Configure Multiple Ports in a Range

The `bridge-ports` attribute takes a range of numbers. The "swp1-52" in
the example below indicates that swp1 through swp52 are part of the
bridge, which is a shortcut that saves you from enumerating each port
individually:

    cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge bridge ports swp1-52
    cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
    cumulus@switch:~$ net commit

These commands create the following configuration in the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file:

    auto bridge
    iface bridge
          bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3 ... swp51 swp52
          bridge-vids 310 700 707 712 850 910
          bridge-vlan-aware yes

### Access Ports and Pruned VLANs

The following example configuration contains an access port and switch
port that are *pruned*; they only sends and receive traffic tagged
to/from a specific set of VLANs declared by the `bridge-vids` attribute.
It also contains other switch ports that send and receive traffic from
all the defined VLANs.

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show configuration files
     
    ...
    # ports swp3-swp48 are trunk ports which inherit vlans from the 'bridge'
    # ie vlans 310,700,707,712,850,910
    #
    auto bridge
    iface bridge
          bridge-ports swp1 swp2 swp3 ... swp51 swp52
          bridge-vids 310 700 707 712 850 910
          bridge-vlan-aware yes
     
    auto swp1
    iface swp1
          bridge-access 310
          mstpctl-bpduguard yes
          mstpctl-portadminedge yes
     
    # The following is a trunk port that is "pruned".
    # native vlan is 1, but only .1q tags of 707, 712, 850 are
    # sent and received
    #
    auto swp2
    iface swp2
          mstpctl-bpduguard yes
          mstpctl-portadminedge yes
          bridge-vids 707 712 850

    # The following port is the trunk uplink and inherits all vlans
    # from 'bridge'; bridge assurance is enabled using 'portnetwork' attribute
    auto swp49
    iface swp49
          mstpctl-portnetwork yes
          mstpctl-portpathcost 10
     
    # The following port is the trunk uplink and inherits all vlans
    # from 'bridge'; bridge assurance is enabled using 'portnetwork' attribute
    auto swp50
    iface swp50
          mstpctl-portnetwork yes
          mstpctl-portpathcost 0
     
    ...

### Large Bond Set Configuration

The configuration below demonstrates a VLAN-aware bridge with a large
set of bonds. The bond configurations are generated from a
[Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) template.

    cumulus@switch:~$ net show configuration files
     
    ...
    #

    #
    # uplink1, peerlink and downlink are bond interfaces.
    # 'bridge' is a vlan aware bridge with ports uplink1, peerlink
    # and downlink (swp2-20).
    #
    # native vlan is by default 1
    #
    # 'bridge-vids' attribute is used to declare vlans.
    # 'bridge-pvid' attribute is used to specify native vlans if other than 1

### VXLANs with VLAN-aware Bridges

Cumulus Linux supports using VXLANs with VLAN-aware bridge
configuration. This provides improved scalability, as multiple VXLANs
can be added to a single VLAN-aware bridge. A 1:1 association is used
between the VXLAN VNI and the VLAN, using the bridge access VLAN
definition on the VXLAN, and the VLAN membership definition on the local
bridge member interfaces.

The configuration example below shows the differences between a VXLAN
configured for traditional bridge mode and one configured for VLAN-aware
mode. The configurations use head end replication (HER), along with the
VLAN-aware bridge to map VLANs to VNIs.

{{%notice note%}}

See the [VXLAN Scale](../../../Network-Virtualization/VXLAN-Scale/)
topic for information about the number of VXLANs you can configure
simultaneously.

    ...

### Configure a Static MAC Address Entry

You can add a static MAC address entry to the layer 2 table for an
interface within the VLAN-aware bridge by running a command similar to
the following:

    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo bridge fdb add 12:34:56:12:34:56 dev swp1 vlan 150 master static
    cumulus@switch:~$ sudo bridge fdb show
    44:38:39:00:00:7c dev swp1 master bridge permanent
    12:34:56:12:34:56 dev swp1 vlan 150 master bridge static
    44:38:39:00:00:7c dev swp1 self permanent
    12:12:12:12:12:12 dev swp1 self permanent
    12:34:12:34:12:34 dev swp1 self permanent
    12:34:56:12:34:56 dev swp1 self permanent
    12:34:12:34:12:34 dev bridge master bridge permanent
    44:38:39:00:00:7c dev bridge vlan 500 master bridge permanent
    12:12:12:12:12:12 dev bridge master bridge permanent

## Caveats and Errata

### Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

VLAN-aware mode supports a single instance of STP across all VLANs, as
STP is enabled on a per-bridge basis. A common practice when using a
single STP instance for all VLANs is to define every VLAN on every
switch in the spanning tree instance.

`mstpd` remains the user space protocol daemon.

Cumulus Linux supports Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP).

### IGMP Snooping

IGMP snooping and group membership are supported on a per-VLAN basis,
though the IGMP snooping configuration (including enable/disable and
mrouter ports) are defined on a per-bridge port basis.

### VLAN Translation

A bridge in VLAN-aware mode cannot have VLAN translation enabled for it.
Only traditional mode bridges can utilize VLAN translation.

### Convert Bridges between Supported Modes

Traditional mode bridges cannot be automatically converted to/from a
VLAN-aware bridge. The original configuration must be deleted, and all
member switch ports must be brought down, then a new bridge can be
created.
