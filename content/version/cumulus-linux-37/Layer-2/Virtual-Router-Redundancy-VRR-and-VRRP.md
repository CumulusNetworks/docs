Cumulus Linux provides the option of using Virtual Router Redundancy
(VRR) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).

**VRR** enables hosts to communicate with any redundant router without
reconfiguration, running dynamic router protocols, or running router
redundancy protocols. This means that redundant routers respond to
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests from hosts. Routers are
configured to respond in an identical manner, but if one fails, the
other redundant routers continue to respond, leaving the hosts with the
impression that nothing has changed. VRR is typically used in an MLAG
configuration.

**VRRP** allows a single virtual default gateway to be shared between
two or more network devices in an active/standby configuration. The
physical VRRP router that forwards packets at any given time is called
the master. If this VRRP router fails, another VRRP standby router
automatically takes over as master. VRRP is used in a non-MLAG
configuration.

{{%notice note%}}

- VRRP is supported in Cumulus Linux 3.7.4 and later.
- You cannot configure both VRR and VRRP on the same switch.

## VRR

The diagram below illustrates a basic VRR-enabled network configuration.
The network includes several hosts and two routers running Cumulus Linux
configured with 
[Multi-chassis Link Aggregation](../Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG/)
(MLAG).

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus Linux only supports VRR on switched virtual interfaces (SVIs).
VRR is not supported on physical interfaces or virtual subinterfaces.

{{%/notice%}}

A production implementation will have many more server hosts and network
connections than are shown here. However, this basic configuration
provides a complete description of the important aspects of the VRR setup.

As the bridges in each of the redundant routers are connected, they will
each receive and reply to ARP requests for the virtual router IP address.

{{%notice note%}}

**Multiple ARP Replies**

Each ARP request made by a host will receive replies from each router;
these replies will be identical, and so the host receiving the replies
will either ignore replies after the first, or accept them and overwrite
the previous identical reply, rather than being confused over which
response is correct.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice info%}}

**Reserved MAC Address Range**

A range of MAC addresses is reserved for use with VRR, in order to
prevent MAC address conflicts with other interfaces in the same bridged
network. The reserved range is `00:00:5E:00:01:00` to
`00:00:5E:00:01:ff`.

Cumulus Networks recommends using MAC addresses from the reserved range
when configuring VRR.

The reserved MAC address range for VRR is the same as for the Virtual
Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), as they serve similar purposes.

### Configure VRR

#### Configure the Routers

The routers implement the layer 2 network interconnecting the hosts and
the redundant routers. To configure the routers, add a bridge with the
following interfaces to each router:

- One bond interface or switch port interface to each host.

    {{%notice note%}}

For networks using MLAG, use bond interfaces. Otherwise, use switch port interfaces.

    {{%/notice%}}

- One or more interfaces to each peer router.

    {{%notice note%}}

Multiple inter-peer links are typically bonded interfaces that
    accommodate higher bandwidth between the routers and offer link
    redundancy.

    {{%/notice%}}

    {{%notice note%}}

The VLAN interface must have unique IP addresses for both the
    physical (the `address` option below) and virtual (the
    `address-virtual` option below) interfaces, as the unique address is
    used when the switch initiates an ARP request.

    {{%/notice%}}

**Example VRR Configuration**

The example NCLU commands below create a VLAN-aware bridge interface for
a VRR-enabled network:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ net add bridge
cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 500 ip address 192.0.2.252/24
cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 500 ip address-virtual 00:00:5e:00:01:01 192.0.2.254/24
cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 500 ipv6 address 2001:db8::1/32
cumulus@switch:~$ net add vlan 500 ipv6 address-virtual 00:00:5e:00:01:01 2001:db8::f/32
cumulus@switch:~$ net pending
cumulus@switch:~$ net commit
```

The NCLU commands above produce the following `/etc/network/interfaces`
snippet:

```
auto bridge
iface bridge
    bridge-vids 500
    bridge-vlan-aware yes

auto vlan500
iface vlan500
    address 192.0.2.252/24
    address 2001:db8::1/32
    address-virtual 00:00:5e:00:01:01 2001:db8::f/32 192.0.2.254/24
    vlan-id 500
    vlan-raw-device bridge
```

#### Configure the Hosts

Each host should have two network interfaces. The routers configure the
interfaces as bonds running LACP; the hosts should also configure its
two interfaces using teaming, port aggregation, port group, or
EtherChannel running LACP. Configure the hosts, either statically or via
DHCP, with a gateway address that is the IP address of the virtual
router; this default gateway address never changes.

Configure the links between the hosts and the routers in *active-active*
mode for First Hop Redundancy Protocol.

### Example VRR Configuration with MLAG

To create an [MLAG](../Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG/)
configuration that incorporates VRR, use a configuration like the following:

## VRRP

VRRP allows for a single virtual default gateway to be shared among two
or more network devices in an active/standby configuration. The VRRP
router that forwards packets at any given time is called the master. If
this VRRP router fails, another VRRP standby router automatically takes
over as master. The master sends VRRP advertisements to other VRRP
routers in the same virtual router group, which include the priority and
state of the master. VRRP router priority determines the role that each
virtual router plays and who becomes the new master if the master fails.

All virtual routers use 00:00:5E:00:01:XX for IPv4 gateways or
00:00:5E:00:02:XX for IPv6 gateways as their MAC address. The last byte
of the address is the Virtual Router IDentifier (VRID), which is
different for each virtual router in the network. This MAC address is
used by only one physical router at a time, which replies with this
address when ARP requests or neighbor solicitation packets are sent for
the IP addresses of the virtual router.

{{%notice note%}}

- VRRP is supported in Cumulus Linux 3.7.4 and later.
- Cumulus Linux supports both VRRPv2 and VRRPv3. The default protocol version is VRRPv3.
- 255 virtual routers are supported per switch.
- VRRP is not supported currently in an MLAG environment.
- To configure VRRP on an SVI or [traditional mode bridge](../Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/Traditional-Bridge-Mode/), you need to edit the `etc/network/interfaces` and `/etc/frr/frr.conf` files. The NCLU commands are not supported with SVIs or traditional mode bridges.

{{%/notice%}}

[RFC 5798](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5798#section-4.1) describes
VRRP in detail.

The following example illustrates a basic VRRP configuration.

{{% imgOld 1 %}}

### Configure VRRP

To configure VRRP, you need to specify the following information on each
switch:

- **A virtual router ID (VRID) that identifies the group of VRRP routers**. You must specify the same ID across all virtual routers in the group.
- **One or more virtual IP addresses that are assigned to the virtual router group**. These are IP addresses that do not directly connect to a specific interface. Inbound packets sent to a virtual IP address are redirected to a physical network interface.

You can also set these optional parameters. If you do not set these parameters, the defaults are used:

| Optional Parameter  | Default Value | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `priority` | 100 | The priority level of the virtual router within the virtual router group, which determines the role that each virtual router plays and what happens if the master fails. Virtual routers have a priority between 1 and 254; the router with the highest priority becomes the master. |
| `advertisement interval` | 1000 milliseconds | The advertisement interval is the interval between successive advertisements by the master in a virtual router group. You can specify a value between 10 and 40950. |
| `preempt` | enabled | Preempt mode lets the router take over as master for a virtual router group if it has a higher priority than the current master. Preempt mode is enabled by default. To disable preempt mode, you need to edit the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file and add the line `no vrrp <VRID> preempt` to the interface stanza, then restart FRR service. |

The NCLU commands write VRRP configuration to the `/etc/network/interfaces` file and the `/etc/frr/frr.conf` file.

The following example commands configure two switches (spine01 and spine02) that form one virtual router group (VRID 44) with IPv4 address 10.0.0.1/24 and IPv6 address 2001:0db8::1/64. *spine01* is the master; it has a priority of 254. *spine02* is the backup VRRP router.

**spine01**

```
cumulus@spine01:~$ net add interface swp1 vrrp 44 10.0.0.1/24
cumulus@spine01:~$ net add interface swp1 vrrp 44 2001:0db8::1/64
cumulus@spine01:~$ net add interface swp1 vrrp 44 priority 254
cumulus@spine01:~$ net add interface swp1 vrrp 44 advertisement-interval 5000
cumulus@spine01:~$ net pending
cumulus@spine01:~$ net commit
```

**spine02**

```
cumulus@spine02:~$ net add interface swp1 vrrp 44 10.0.0.1/24
cumulus@spine02:~$ net add interface swp1 vrrp 44 2001:0db8::1/64
cumulus@spine02:~$ net pending
cumulus@spine02:~$ net commit
```

The NCLU commands save the configuration in the `/etc/frr/frr.conf`
file. For example:

```
cumulus@spine01:~$ sudo cat /etc/frr/frr.conf
...
interface swp1
  vrrp 44
  vrrp 44 advertisement-interval 5000
  vrrp 44 priority 254
  vrrp 44 ip 10.0.0.1
  vrrp 44 ipv6 2001:0db8::1
...
```

### Show VRRP Configuration

To show virtual router information on a switch, run the `net show vrrp <VRID>` command. For example:

```
cumulus@spine01:~$ net show vrrp 44
