Cumulus Linux 3.4 and later releases replace Quagga with FRRouting. This section outlines the upgrade process for users currently using Quagga.

{{%notice note%}}

These instructions only apply to upgrading to Cumulus Linux 3.4 or later from releases earlier than 3.4. New image installations contain `frr` instead of `quagga` or `quagga-compat`. If you are using any automation tools to configure your network and are installing a new Cumulus Linux image, make sure your automation tools refer to FRR and not to Quagga.

If you are upgrading Cumulus Linux using `apt-get upgrade`, existing automation that references Quagga continues to work until you upgrade to FRR. Once you perform the following upgrade steps, your automation **must** reference FRR instead of Quagga.

{{%/notice%}}

{{%notice warning%}}

Upgrading to Cumulus Linux 3.4 or later results in both `quagga.service` and `frr.service` being present on the system, until `quagga.service` is removed. These services have been configured to conflict with each other; starting one service automatically stops the other, as they cannot run concurrently.

{{%/notice%}}

Run the following commands to begin the upgrade process:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get update
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get upgrade
```

{{%notice note%}}

At the end of the `apt-get upgrade` process, the output shows details of the upgrade process, regarding the Quagga to FRR switchover.

| Your system has been upgraded to use Cumulus Linux's new routing protocol   |
| suite, FRRouting. The 'quagga' package is now a dummy transitional package  |
| and may be removed.                                                         |
|                                                                             |
| As part of this upgrade, please take note of the following information:     |
|                                                                             |
|  - The location of your configuration files has changed to /etc/frr.        |
|    In order to enable a seamless transition, FRRouting will continue to     |
|    read all configuration files from /etc/quagga until the transition is    |
|    completed.                                                               |
|                                                                             |
|  - In the interest of stability, action is required on your part to         |
|    complete the transition to FRRouting. For instructions on how to do      |
|    this, please refer to the Cumulus Linux documentation.                   |

After the upgrade process is completed, the switch is in the following state:

The output below shows the FRR / Quagga package status:

```

```

{{%notice note%}}

Cumulus 3.4 and later releases do not support or implement
`python-clcmd`. While the package remains, the related commands have
been removed.

{{%/notice%}}

To complete the transition to FRR:

1. Migrate all `/etc/quagga/*` files to `/etc/frr/*`.

    {{%notice warning%}}

The `vtysh.conf` file should not be moved, as it is unlikely any configuration is in the file. However, if there is necessary configuration in place, copy the contents into `/etc/frr/vtysh.conf`.

{{%/notice%}}

2. Merge the current `Quagga.conf` file with the new `frr.conf` file. Keep the default configuration for `frr.conf` in place, and add the additional configuration sections from `Quagga.conf`.

3. Enable the daemons needed for your installation in `/etc/frr/daemons`.

4. Manually update the log file locations to `/var/log/frr` or `syslog`.

5. Remove the compatibility package:

    {{%notice warning%}}

This step stops the Quagga compatibility mode, causing routing to go down.

{{%/notice%}}

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get remove quagga quagga-compat quagga-doc
```

    {{%notice note%}}

Removing the `quagga-compat` package also removes `quagga.service`.

However, the `/etc/quagga` directory is not removed in this step, as it is left in place for reference.

{{%/notice%}}

6. Purge the Quagga packages:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo dpkg -P quagga quagga-compat
```

    {{%notice warning%}}

This step deletes all Quagga configuration files. Please ensure you back up your configuration.

{{%/notice%}}

    {{%notice warning%}}

Cumulus Networks does not recommend reinstalling the `quagga` and `quagga-compat` packages once they have been removed. While they can be reinstalled to continue migration iterations, limited testing has taken place, and configuration issues may occur.

{{%/notice%}}

7. Start FRR without Quagga compatibility mode:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl start frr.service
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl -l status frr.service
```

## Troubleshooting

If the `systemctl -l status frr` output shows an issue, edit the configuration files to correct it, and repeat the process. If issues persist, you can return to Quagga compatibility mode for further testing:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo -E apt-get install quagga-compat
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl stop frr.service
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl disable frr.service
```

{{%notice note%}}

Several configuration migration iterations may be necessary to ensure the configuration is behaving the same in both Quagga and FRR.

{{%/notice%}}

When further testing is complete, run the following commands to reset the FRR installation, and then repeat the steps from the beginning of this section to upgrade to FRR:

```
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl reset-failed frr.service
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo systemctl enable frr.service
```
