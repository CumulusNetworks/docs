Cumulus Linux provides an ASIC monitoring tool that collects and
distributes data about the state of the ASIC. The monitoring tool polls
for data at specific intervals and takes certain actions so that you can
quickly identify and respond to problems, such as:

  - Microbursts that result in longer packet latency
  - Packet buffer congestion that might lead to packet drops
  - Network problems with a particular switch, port, or traffic class

{{%notice note%}}

ASIC monitoring is currently supported on switches with [Spectrum ASICs](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/hardware-compatibility-list/?asic%5B0%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum&asic%5B1%5D=Mellanox%20Spectrum_A1) only.

## What Type of Statistics Can You Collect?

You can collect the following type of statistics with the ASIC
monitoring tool:

  - A fine-grained history of queue lengths using histograms maintained
    by the ASIC
  - Packet counts per port, priority and size
  - Dropped packet, pause frame, and ECN-marked packet counts
  - Buffer congestion occupancy per port, priority and buffer pool, and
    at input and output ports

## Collecting Queue Lengths in Histograms

The Spectrum ASIC provides a mechanism to measure and report
egress queue lengths in histograms (a graphical representation of data,
which is divided into intervals or bins). You can configure the ASIC to
measure up to 64 egress queues. Each queue is reported through a
histogram with 10 bins, where each bin represents a range of queue
lengths.

You configure the histogram with a minimum size boundary (Min) and a
histogram size. You then derive the maximum size boundary (Max) by
adding the minimum size boundary and the histogram size.

The 10 bins are numbered 0 through 9. Bin 0 represents queue lengths up
to the Min specified, including queue length 0. Bin 9 represents queue
lengths of Max and above. Bins 1 through 8 represent equal-sized ranges
between the Min and Max, which is determined by dividing the histogram
size by 8.

For example, consider the following histogram queue length ranges, in
bytes:

  - Min = 960
  - Histogram size = 12288
  - Max = 13248
  - Range size = 1536
  - Bin 0: 0:959
  - Bin 1: 960:2495
  - Bin 2: 2496:4031
  - Bin 3: 4032:5567
  - Bin 4: 5568:7103
  - Bin 5: 7104:8639
  - Bin 6: 8640:10175
  - Bin 7: 10176:11711
  - Bin 8: 11712:13247
  - Bin 9: 13248:\*

The following illustration demonstrates a histogram showing how many
times the queue length for a port was in the ranges specified by each
bin. The example shows that the queue length was between 960 and 2495
bytes 125 times within one second.

## Configure ASIC Monitoring

The ASIC monitoring tool is managed by the `asic-monitor` service,
(which is managed by `systemd`). The `asic-monitor` service reads the
`/etc/cumulus/datapath/monitor.conf` configuration file to determine
what statistics to collect and when to trigger. The service always
starts; however, if the configuration file is empty, the service exits.

The `monitor.conf` configuration file provides information about the
type of data to collect, the switch ports to monitor, how and when to
start reading the ASIC (such as when a specific queue length or number
of packets dropped is reached), and what actions to take (create a
snapshot file, send a message to the `/var/log/syslog` file, or collect
more data).

To configure ASIC monitoring, edit the
`/etc/cumulus/datapath/monitor.conf` file and restart the `asic-monitor`
service. The `asic-monitor` service reads the new configuration file and
then runs until it is stopped.

The following procedure describes how to monitor queue lengths using a
histogram. The settings are configured to collect data every second and
write the results to a snapshot file. When the size of the queue reaches
500 bytes, the system sends a message to the `/var/log/syslog` file.

To monitor queue lengths using a histogram:

1.  Open the `/etc/cumulus/datapath/monitor.conf` file in a text editor.

        cumulus@switch:~$ sudo nano /etc/cumulus/datapath/monitor.conf

2.  At the end of the file, add the following line to specify the name
    of the histogram monitor (port group). The example uses
    `histogram_pg`; however, you can use any name you choose. You must
    use the same name with all histogram settings.

        monitor.port_group_list = [histogram_pg]

3.  Add the following line to specify the ports you want to monitor. The
    following example sets swp1 through swp50.

        monitor.histogram_pg.port_set = swp1-swp50

4.  Add the following line to set the data type to `histogram`. This is
    the data type for histogram monitoring.

        monitor.histogram_pg.stat_type = histogramÂ 

5.  Add the following line to set the trigger type to `timer`.
    Currently, the only trigger type available is timer.

        monitor.histogram_pg.trigger_type = timer

6.  Add the following line to set the frequency at which data collection
    starts. In the following example, the frequency is set to one
    second.

        monitor.histogram_pg.timer = 1s

7.  Add the following line to set the actions you want to take when data
    is collected. In the following example, the system writes the
    results of data collection to a snapshot file and sends a message to
    the `/var/log/syslog` file .

        monitor.histogram_pg.action_list = [snapshot,log]

8.  Add the following line to specify a name and location for the
    snapshot file. In the following example, the system writes the
    snapshot to a file called `histogram_stats` in the
    `/var/lib/cumulus` directory and adds a suffix to the file name with
    the snapshot file count (see the following step).

        monitor.histogram_pg.snapshot.file = /var/lib/cumulus/histogram_stats

9.  Add the following line to set the number of snapshots that are taken
    before the system starts overwriting the earliest snapshot files.  
    In the following example, because the snapshot file count is set to
    64, the first snapshot file is named `histogram_stats_0` and the
    64th snapshot is named `histogram_stats_63`. When the 65th snapshot
    is taken, the original snapshot file (`histogram_stats_0`) is
    overwritten and the sequence continues until `histogram_stats_63` is
    written. Then, the sequence restarts.

        monitor.histogram_pg.snapshot.file_count = 64

10. Add the following line to include a threshold, which determines how
    to collect data. Setting a threshold is optional. In the following
    example, when the size of the queue reaches 500 bytes, the system
    sends a message to the `/var/log/syslog` file .

        monitor.histogram_pg.log.queue_bytes = 500

11. Add the following lines to set the size, minimum boundary, and
    sampling time of the histogram. Adding the histogram size and the
    minimum boundary size together produces the maximum boundary size.
    These settings are used to represent the range of queue lengths per
    bin.

        monitor.histogram_pg.histogram.minimum_bytes_boundary = 960
        monitor.histogram_pg.histogram.histogram_size_bytes   = 12288
        monitor.histogram_pg.histogram.sample_time_ns         = 1024

12. Save the file, then restart the `asic-monitor` service with the
    following command.

        cumulus@switch:~$ systemctl restart asic-monitor.service

    {{%notice note%}}

Restarting the `asic-monitor` service does not disrupt traffic or
    require you to restart `switchd`. The service is enabled by default
    when you boot the switch and restarts when you restart `switchd`.

    {{%/notice%}}

    {{%notice note%}}

**Important**

Overhead is involved in collecting the data, which uses both the CPU
    and SDK process and can affect execution of `switchd`. Snapshots and
    logs can occupy a lot of disk space if you do not limit their
    number.

    {{%/notice%}}

To collect other data, such as all packets per port, buffer congestion,
or packet drops due to error, follow the procedure above but change the
port group list setting to include the port group name you want to use.
For example, to monitor packet drops due to buffer congestion:

    monitor.port_group_list = [buffers_pg]
    monitor.buffers_pg.port_set  = swp1-swp50
    monitor.buffers_pg.stat_type = buffer
    ...

Certain settings in the procedure above (such as the histogram size,
boundary size, and sampling time) only apply to the histogram monitor.
All ASIC monitor settings are described in
[ASIC Monitoring Settings](#asic-monitoring-settings).

## Configuration Examples

Several configuration examples are provided below.

### Queue Length Histograms

In the following example:

- Queue length histograms are collected every second for swp1 through swp50.
- The results are written to the `/var/lib/cumulus/histogram_stats` snapshot file.
- The size of the histogram is set to 12288 bytes, the minimum boundary to 960 bytes, and the sampling time to 1024 nanoseconds.
- A threshold is set so that when the size of the queue reaches 500
  bytes, the system sends a message to the `/var/log/syslog` file.

```
    monitor.port_group_list                               = [histogram_pg]
    monitor.histogram_pg.port_set                         = swp1-swp50
    monitor.histogram_pg.stat_type                        = histogram
    monitor.histogram_pg.cos_list                         = [0]
    monitor.histogram_pg.trigger_type                     = timer
    monitor.histogram_pg.timer                            = 1s
    monitor.histogram_pg.action_list                      = [snapshot,log]
    monitor.histogram_pg.snapshot.file                    = /var/lib/cumulus/histogram_stats
    monitor.histogram_pg.snapshot.file_count              = 64
    monitor.histogram_pg.log.queue_bytes                  = 500
    monitor.histogram_pg.histogram.minimum_bytes_boundary = 960
    monitor.histogram_pg.histogram.histogram_size_bytes   = 12288
    monitor.histogram_pg.histogram.sample_time_ns         = 1024
```

### Packet Drops Due to Errors

In the following example:

- Packet drops on swp1 through swp50 are collected every two seconds.
- If the number of packet drops is greater than 100, the results are
    written to the `/var/lib/cumulus/discard_stats snapshot` file and
    the system sends a message to the `/var/log/syslog` file.

    monitor.port_group_list                            = [discards_pg]
    monitor.discards_pg.port_set                       = swp1-swp50
    monitor.discards_pg.stat_type                      = packet
    monitor.discards_pg.action_list                    = [snapshot,log]
    monitor.discards_pg.trigger_type                   = timer
    monitor.discards_pg.timer                          = 2s
    monitor.discards_pg.log.packet_error_drops         = 100
    monitor.discards_pg.snapshot.packet_error_drops    = 100
    monitor.discards_pg.snapshot.file                  = /var/lib/cumulus/discard_stats
    monitor.discards_pg.snapshot.file_count            = 16

### Queue Length (Histogram) with Collect Actions

A collect action triggers the collection of additional information. You
can daisy chain multiple monitors (port groups) into a single collect
action.

In the following example:

- Queue length histograms are collected for swp1 through swp50 every second.
- The results are written to the `/var/lib/cumulus/histogram_stats`
  snapshot file.
- When the queue length reaches 500 bytes, the system sends a message
  to the `/var/log/syslog` file and collects additional data; buffer
  occupancy and all packets per port.
- Buffer occupancy data is written to the
  `/var/lib/cumulus/buffer_stats` snapshot file and all packets per
  port data is written to the `/var/lib/cumulus/all_packet_stats`
  snapshot file.
- In addition, packet drops on swp1 through swp50 are collected every
  two seconds. If the number of packet drops is greater than 100, the
  results are written to the `/var/lib/cumulus/discard_stats` snapshot
  file and a message is sent to the `/var/log/syslog` file.

    monitor.port_group_list                               = [histogram_pg,discards_pg]

    monitor.discards_pg.snapshot.file_count               = 16
```

{{%notice note%}}

Certain actions require additional settings. For example, if the `snapshot` action
is specified, a snapshot file is also required. If the `log` action is specified,
a log threshold is also required. See [action\_list](#asic-monitoring-settings)
for additional settings required for each *action*.

{{%/notice%}}

## Example Snapshot File

A snapshot action writes a snapshot of the current state of the ASIC to
a file. Because parsing the file and finding the information can be
tedious, you can use a third-party analysis tool to analyze the data in
the file. The following example shows a snapshot of queue lengths.

    {"timestamp_info": {"start_datetime": "2017-03-16 21:36:40.775026", "end_datetime": "2017-03-16 21:36:40.775848"}, "buffer_info": null, "packet_info": null, "histogram_info": {"swp2": {"0": 55531}, "swp32": {"0": 48668}, "swp1": {"0": 64578}}}

## Example Log Message

A log action writes out the ASIC state to the `/var/log/syslog` file. In
the following example, when the size of the queue reaches 500 bytes, the
system sends this message to the `/var/log/syslog` file:

    2018-02-26T20:14:41.560840+00:00 cumulus asic-monitor-module INFO:  2018-02-26 20:14:41.559967: Egress queue(s) greater than 500 bytes in monitor port group histogram_pg.
