A virtual NetQ demo environment is available on the [Cumulus Networks
GitHub site](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-netq), allowing
you to try out NetQ on your own, or to test/validate updates to your
network before deploying them into production.

The environment uses a series of Cumulus VX virtual machines built using
the Cumulus Networks [reference
topology](https://github.com/cumulusnetworks/cldemo-vagrant), which
requires Vagrant and a hypervisor like VirtualBox. The [GitHub
site](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-netq) provides
information on downloading and installing the hypervisor.
