Running NetQ on Linux hosts provides unprecedented network visibility,
giving the network operator a complete view of the entire
infastrucutre's network connectivity instead of just from the network
devices.

The NetQ Agent is supported on the following Linux hosts:

  - CentOS 7
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1
  - Ubuntu 16.04

You need to install the OS-specific NetQ metapack on every host you want
to monitor with NetQ. For more information, see the 
[current NetQ documentation](/cumulus-netq/Cumulus-NetQ-Deployment-Guide/Install-NetQ/).
