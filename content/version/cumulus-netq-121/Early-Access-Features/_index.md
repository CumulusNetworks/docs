NetQ has [early
access](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/202933878-Early-Access-Features-Defined)
features that provide advanced access to new functionality before it
becomes generally available. The following features are early access in
NetQ 1.2:

In NetQ 1.2, early access features are bundled into the `netq-apps`
package; there is no specific EA package like there typically is with
Cumulus Linux.

You enable early access features by running the ` netq config add
 `command. You disable the early access features by running the `netq
config del` command.
