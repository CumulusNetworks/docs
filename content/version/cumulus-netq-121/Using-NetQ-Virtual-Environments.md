You can try out NetQ in two different virtual environments. These
environments enable you to try out NetQ on your own, or to test/validate
updates to your network before deploying them into production. They are:

  - [Cumulus in the
    Cloud](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-in-the-cloud/),
    which is a virtual data center that includes the NetQ telemetry
    server for monitoring your Cumulus in the Cloud instance.

  - The [Cumulus Networks GitHub
    site](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-netq) has a virtual
    NetQ demo environment. The environment uses a series of Cumulus VX
    virtual machines built using the Cumulus Networks [reference
    topology](https://github.com/cumulusnetworks/cldemo-vagrant), which
    requires Vagrant and a hypervisor like VirtualBox. The [GitHub
    site](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-netq) provides
    information on downloading and installing the hypervisor.
