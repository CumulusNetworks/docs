## What's New in Cumulus NetQ 2.1

Cumulus NetQ has been reinvented to scale with the fast adoption rate of
open networks and rapid network growth. In addition to the real-time
data collection and fabric-wide performance analysis that are already
supported in Cumulus NetQ 1.4.1, Cumulus NetQ now offers a graphical
user interface for:

  - Data visualizations of the overlay and underlay networks,
  - Simplified network troubleshooting with network-wide roll-ups of
    health and alarm status in a single card, and
  - Proactive validation of the network status and configuration to
    regularly detect network issues.

For further information regarding new features, improvements, bug fixes,
and known issues present in this release, refer to the [release
notes](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017779214).

## Available Documentation

The NetQ
documentation set has been reorganized and updated from prior releases.
They still provide the information you need to proactively monitor your
Linux-based network fabric using Cumulus NetQ. They assume that you have
already installed Cumulus Linux and NetQ.

You may
start anywhere in the documentation or read it from start to finish
depending on your role and familiarity with the NetQ software and Linux
networking. If you are
new to NetQ, you may want to read the Cumulus NetQ Primer before reading
the other available documents.
