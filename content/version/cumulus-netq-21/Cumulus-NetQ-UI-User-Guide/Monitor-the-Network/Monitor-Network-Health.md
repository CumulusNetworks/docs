As with any network, one of the challenges is keeping track of all of
the moving parts. With the NetQ GUI, you can view the overall health of
your network at a glance and then delve deeper for periodic checks or as
conditions arise that require attention. For a general understanding of
how well your network is operating, the Network Health card workflow is
the best place to start as it contains the highest view and performance
rollups.

## Network Health Card Workflow Summary

## View Network Health Summary

Overall network health is based on successful validation results. The
summary includes the percentage of successful results, a trend
indicator, and a distribution of the validation results.

To view a summary of your network health, open the small Network Health
card.

{{% imgOld 13 %}}

In this example, the overall health is quite low and digging further for
causes is definitely warranted. Refer to the next section for viewing
the key health metrics.

## View Key Metrics of Network Health

Overall network health is a calculated average of several key health
metrics: System, Network Services, and Interface health.

To view these key metrics, open the medium Network Health card. Each
metric is shown with the the percentage of successful validations, a
trend indicator, and a distribution of the validation results.

{{% imgOld 14 %}}

In this example, the health of each of the three key metrics are all
good. You might choose to dig further on the system health if it did not
continue to improve. Refer to the following section for additional
details.

## View System Health

The system health is a calculated average of the NetQ Agent, Cumulus
Linux license, and sensor health metrics. In all cases, validation is
performed on the agents and licenses.. If you are monitoring platform
sensors, the calculation includes these as well. You can view the
overall health of the system from the medium Network Health card and
information about each component from the large Network Health card.

To view information about each system component:

1.  Open the large Network Health card.

2.  Hover over the card and click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/04-Programing-Apps-Websites/10-Apps/laptop-heart.svg", height="18", width="18"/>.  
    
    {{% imgOld 16 %}}

The health of each protocol or service is
represented on the left side of the card by a distribution of the health
score, a trend indicator, and a percentage of successful results. The
right side of the card provides a listing of devices running the
services.

### View Devices with the Most Issues

It is useful to know which devices are experiencing the most issues with
their system services in general, as this can help focus troubleshooting
efforts toward selected devices versus the service itself. To view
devices with the most issues, select **Most Failures** from the filter
above the table on the right.

{{% imgOld 17 %}}

Devices with the highest number of issues are listed at the top. Scroll
down to view those with fewer issues. To further investigate the
critical devices, open the Event cards and filter on the indicated
switches.

### View Devices with Recent Issues

It is useful to know which devices are experiencing the most issues with
their network services right now, as this can help focus troubleshooting
efforts toward selected devices versus the service itself. To view
devices with recent issues, select **Recent Failures** from the filter
above the table on the right. Devices with the highest number of issues
are listed at the top. Scroll down to view those with fewer issues. To
further investigate the critical devices, open the Switch card or the
Event cards and filter on the indicated switches.

### Filter Results by System Service

You can focus the data in the table on the right, by unselecting one or
more services. Click the checkbox next to the service you want to remove
from the data. In this example, we have unchecked Licenses.

{{% imgOld 18 %}}

This grays out the associated chart and temporarily removes the data
related to that service from the table.

## View Network Services Health

The network services health is a calculated average of the individual
network protocol and services health metrics. In all cases, validation
is performed on NTP. If you are running BGP, CLAG, EVPN, LNV, OSPF, or
VXLAN protocols the calculation includes these as well. You can view the
overall health of network services from the medium Network Health card
and information about individual services from the large Network Health
card.

To view information about each network protocol or service:

1.  Open the large Network Health card.

2.  Hover over the card and click <img src="https://icons.cumulusnetworks.com/05-Internet-Networks-Servers/01-Worldwide-Web/network-heart.svg", height="18", width="18"/>.  
    
    {{% imgOld 20 %}}
    
The health of each protocol or service is represented on the left side
of the card by a distribution of the health score, a trend indicator,
and a percentage of successful results. The right side of the card
provides a listing of devices running the services.

{{%notice tip%}}

If you have more services running than fit naturally into the chart
area, a scroll bar appears for you to access their data.

Use the scroll bars on the table to view more columns and rows.

{{%/notice%}}

### View Devices with the Most Issues

It is useful to know which devices are experiencing the most issues with
their network services in general, as this can help focus
troubleshooting efforts toward selected devices versus the protocol or
service. To view devices with the most issues, open the large Network
Health card. Select **Most Failures** from the dropdown above the table
on the right.

{{% imgOld 21 %}}

Devices with the highest number of issues are listed at the top. Scroll
down to view those with fewer issues. To further investigate the
critical devices, open the Event cards and filter on the indicated
switches.

### View Devices with Recent Issues

It is useful to know which devices are experiencing the most issues with
their network services right now, as this can help focus troubleshooting
efforts toward selected devices versus the protocol or service. To view
devices with the most issues, open the large Network Health card. Select
**Recent Failures** from the dropdown above the table on the right.
Devices with the highest number of issues are listed at the top. Scroll
down to view those with fewer issues. To further investigate the
critical devices, open the Switch card or the Event cards and filter on the indicated
switches.

### Filter Results by Network Service

You can focus the data in the table on the right, by unselecting one or
more services. Click the checkbox next to the service you want to
remove. In this example, we are removed NTP and LNV and are in the
process of removing OSPF.

{{% imgOld 22 %}}

This grays out the charts and temporarily removes the data related to
that service from the table.

## View All Events

The Network Health card workflow enables you to view all of the alarms
and info events in the network during the designated time period.

To view all events:

1.  Open the full screen Network Health card.

2.  Click **All Events** tab in the navigation panel.

3.  Sort event data by **Time** column to view events in most recent to
    least recent order.

{{% imgOld 23 %}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options
include:

- Sort or filter event data instead by severity, for example, or type.
- Export the data for use in another analytics tool, by clicking
**Export** and providing a name for the data file.
