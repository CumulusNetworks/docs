The Cumulus NetQ UI enables operators to view the health of the MLAG
service on a network-wide and a per session basis, giving greater
insight into all aspects of the service. This is accomplished through
two card workflows, one for the service and one for the session. They
are described separately here.

{{%notice info%}}

**MLAG or CLAG?**

The Cumulus Linux implementation of MLAG is referred to by other vendors
as CLAG, MC-LAG or VPC. The Cumulus NetQ UI uses the CLAG terminology.

## Monitor the CLAG Service (All Sessions)

With NetQ, you can monitor the number of nodes running the CLAG service,
view sessions running, and view alarms triggered by the CLAG service.
For an overview and how to configure CLAG in your data center network,
refer to [Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation -
MLAG](https://docs-rip.cumulusnetworks.com/display/NETQ21/Multi-Chassis+Link+Aggregation+-+MLAG).

### View Service Status Summary

A summary of the CLAG service is available from the CLAG Service card
workflow, including the number of nodes running the service, the number
of CLAG-related alarms, and a distribution of those alarms.

To view the summary, open the small CLAG Service card.

{{% imgOld 18 %}}

For more detail, select a different size CLAG Service card.

### View the Distribution of Sessions and Alarms

It is useful to know the number of network nodes running the CLAG
protocol over a period of time, as it gives you insight into the amount
of traffic associated with and breadth of use of the protocol. It is
also useful to compare the number of nodes running CLAG with the alarms
present at the same time to determine if there is any correlation
between the issues and the ability to establish an CLAG session.

To view these distributions, open the medium CLAG Service card.

{{% imgOld 19 %}}

If a visual correlation is apparent, you can dig a little deeper with
the large CLAG Service card tabs.

### View Devices with the Most CLAG Sessions

You can view the load from CLAG on your switches using the large CLAG
Service card. This data enables you to see which switches are handling
the most CLAG traffic currently, validate that is what is expected based
on your network design, and compare that with data from an earlier time
to look for any differences.

To view switches and hosts with the most CLAG sessions:

1.  Open the large CLAG Service card.

2.  Select **SWITCHES WITH MOST SESSIONS** from the filter above the
    table.  
    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes
    running the most CLAG sessions at the top. Scroll down to view those
    with the fewest sessions.
    
    {{% imgOld 20 %}}

To compare this data with the same data at a previous time:

1.  Open another large CLAG Service card.

2.  Move the new card next to the original card if needed.

3.  Change the time period for the data on the new card by hovering over
    the card and clicking <span style="color: #353744;"> </span>
    
    {{% imgOld 21 %}}
    
    .

4.  Select the time period that you want to compare with the current
    time.  
    You can now see whether there are significant differences between
    this time period and the previous time period.  
    
    {{% imgOld 22 %}}
    
    {{% imgOld 23 %}}
    
      
    If the changes are unexpected, you can investigate further by
    looking at another time frame, determining if more nodes are now
    running CLAG than previously, looking for changes in the topology,
    and so forth.

### View Devices with the Most Unestablished CLAG Sessions

You can identify switches that are experiencing difficulties
establishing CLAG sessions; both currently and in the past.

To view switches with the most unestablished CLAG sessions:

1.  Open the large CLAG Service card.

2.  Select **SWITCHES WITH MOST UNESTABLISHED SESSIONS** from the filter
    above the table.  
    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes
    with the most unestablished CLAG sessions at the top. Scroll down to
    view those with the fewest unestablished sessions.
    
    {{% imgOld 24 %}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options
include:

  - Hover over the any of the charts to focus on the number of switches
    or sessions with the chart characteristic during that smaller time
    slice.  
    The table content changes to match the hovered content. Click on the
    chart to persist the table changes.
    
    {{% imgOld 25 %}}

  - Change the time period for the data to compare with a prior time.  
    
    {{% imgOld 26 %}}
    
    {{% imgOld 27 %}}
    
      
    If the same switches are consistently indicating the most
    unestablished sessions, you might want to look more carefully at
    those switches using the Switches card workflow to determine
    probable causes. Refer to [Monitor
    Switches](https://docs-rip.cumulusnetworks.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10460693).

  - Click **Show All Sessions** to investigate all CLAG sessions with
    events in the full screen card.

### View Switches with the Most CLAG-related Alarms

Switches experiencing a large number of CLAG alarms may indicate a
configuration or performance issue that needs further investigation. You
can view the switches sorted by the number of CLAG alarms and then use
the Switches card workflow or the Alarms card workflow to gather more
information about possible causes for the alarms.

To view switches with most CLAG alarms:

1.  Open the large CLAG Service card.

2.  Hover over the header and click
    
    {{% imgOld 28 %}}
    
    .

3.  Select **EVENTS BY MOST ACTIVE DEVICE** from the filter above the
    table.  
    The table content is sorted by this characteristic, listing nodes
    with the most CLAG alarms at the top. Scroll down to view those with
    the fewest alarms.
    
    {{% imgOld 29 %}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options
include:

  - Hover over the Total Alarms chart to focus on the switches
    exhibiting alarms during that smaller time slice.  
    The table content changes to match the hovered content. Click on the
    chart to persist the table changes.
    
    {{% imgOld 30 %}}

  - Change the time period for the data to compare with a prior time. If
    the same switches are consistently indicating the most alarms, you
    might want to look more carefully at those switches using the
    Switches card workflow.  
    
    {{% imgOld 31 %}}
    
    {{% imgOld 32 %}}

  - Click **Show All Sessions** to investigate all CLAG sessions with
    alarms in the full screen card.

### View All CLAG Events

The CLAG Service card workflow enables you to view all of the CLAG
events in the designated time period.

To view all CLAG events:

1.  Open the full screen CLAG Service card.

2.  Click **All Alarms** tab.
    
    {{% imgOld 33 %}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options
include:

  - Open the **All Switches** or **All Sessions** tabs to look more
    closely at the alarms from the switch or session perspective.

  - Sort on other parameters:
    
      - by **Message** to determine the frequency of particular events
    
      - by **Severity** to determine the most critical events
    
      - by **Time** to find events that may have occurred at a
        particular time to try to correlate them with other system
        events

  - Export the data to a file by clicking **Export** or selecting a
    subset and clicking **Export Selected** in edit menu

  - Return to your workbench by clicking

## Monitor a Single CLAG Session

With NetQ, you can monitor the number of nodes running the CLAG service,
view switches with the most peers alive and not alive, and view alarms
triggered by the CLAG service. For an overview and how to configure CLAG
in your data center network, refer to [Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation -
MLAG](https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/DOCS/Multi-Chassis+Link+Aggregation+-+MLAG).

{{%notice info%}}

To access the single session cards, you must open the full screen CLAG
Service (all sessions) card and double-click on a session.

{{%/notice%}}

### Granularity of Data Shown Based on Time Period

On the medium and large single CLAG session cards, the status of the
peers is represented in heat maps stacked vertically; one for peers that
are reachable (alive), and one for peers that are unreachable (not
alive). Depending on the time period of data on the card, the number of
smaller time blocks used to indicate the status varies. A vertical stack
of time blocks, one from each map, includes the results from all checks
during that time. The results are shown by how saturated the color is
for each block. If all peers during that time period were alive for the
entire time block, then the top block is 100% saturated (white) and the
not alive block is zero percent saturated (gray). As peers that are not
alive increase in saturation, the peers that are alive block is
proportionally reduced in saturation. An example heat map for a time
period of 24 hours is shown here with the most common time periods in
the table showing the resulting time blocks.

{{% imgOld 39 %}}

| Time Period | Number of Runs | Number Time Blocks | Amount of Time in Each Block |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 6 hours     | 18             | 6                  | 1 hour                       |

### View Session Status Summary

A summary of the CLAG session is available from the CLAG Session card
workflow, showing the node and its peer and current status.

To view the summary:

1.  Open the full screen CLAG Service card.

2.  Select a session from the listing to view.

3.  Close the full screen card to view the medium CLAG Session card.  
    
    {{% imgOld 74 %}}
    
    {{% imgOld 75 %}}
    
      
    In the left example, we see that the tor1 switch plays the secondary
    role in this session with the switch at 44:38:39:ff:01:01. In the
    right example, we see that the leaf03 switch plays the primary role
    in this session with leaf04.

### View CLAG Session Peering State Changes

You can view the peering state for a given CLAG session from the medium
and large CLAG Session cards. For a given time period, you can determine
the stability of the CLAG session between two devices. If you
experienced connectivity issues at a particular time, you can use these
cards to help verify the state of the peer. If the peer was not alive
more than it was alive, you can then investigate further into possible
causes.

To view the state transitions for a given CLAG session:

1.  Open the full screen CLAG Service card.

2.  Select a session from the listing to view.

3.  Close the full screen card to view the medium CLAG Session card.
    
    {{% imgOld 76 %}}
    
    In this example, the peer switch has been alive for the entire
    24-hour period.

From this card, you can also view the node role, peer role and state,
and CLAG system MAC address which identify the session in more detail.

To view the peering state transitions for a given CLAG session on the
large CLAG Session card, open that card.

{{% imgOld 77 %}}

From this card, you can also view the alarm and info event counts, node
role, peer role, state, and interface, CLAG system MAC address, active
backup IP address, single, dual, conflicted, and protocol down bonds,
and the VXLAN anycast address identifying the session in more detail.

### View All CLAG Session Details

You can view all stored attributes of all of the CLAG sessions
associated with the two devices on this card.

To view all session details, open the full screen CLAG Session card, and
click the **All CLAG Sessions** tab.

{{% imgOld 78 %}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options
include:

  - Open the **All Events** tabs to look more closely at the alarm and
    info events fin the network.

  - Sort on other parameters:
    
      - by **Single Bonds** to determine which interface sets are only
        connected to one of the switches
    
      - by **Backup IP and Backup IP Active** to determine if the
        correct backup IP address is specified for the service

  - Export the data to a file by clicking **Export** or selecting a
    subset and clicking **Export Selected** in edit menu

  - Return to your workbench by clicking
    
    {{% imgOld 79 %}}
    
    in the top right corner

### View All Events

You can view all of the alarm and info events for the two devices on
this card.

To view all events, open the full screen CLAG Session card, and click
the **All Events** tab.

{{% imgOld 80 %}}

Where to go next depends on what data you see, but a few options
include:

  - Open the **All CLAG Sessions** tabs to look more closely at the
    individual sessions.

  - Sort on other parameters:
    
      - by **Message** to determine the frequency of particular events
    
      - by **Severity** to determine the most critical events
    
      - by **Time** to find events that may have occurred at a
        particular time to try to correlate them with other system
        events

  - Export the data to a file by clicking **Export** or selecting a
    subset and clicking **Export Selected** in edit menu

  - Return to your workbench by clicking
