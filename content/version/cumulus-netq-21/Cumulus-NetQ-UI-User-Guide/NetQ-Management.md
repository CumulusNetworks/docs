application-wide settings for the NetQ UI from a single location.

Individual users have the ability to set preferences specific to their
workspaces. This information is covered separately. Refer to
<span style="color: #ff0000;"> [User
Settings](/version/cumulus-netq-21/Cumulus-NetQ-UI-User-Guide/NetQ-User-Interface-Overview)
</span> .

The NetQ Management workbench is accessed from the main menu and from
the header of an open workbench. For the user or users responsible for

## Manage User Accounts</span>

From the NetQ Management workbench, you can view the number of users
with accounts in the system. As an administrator, you can also add,
modify, and delete user accounts using the User Accounts card.

### <span id="src-12321950_safe-id-TmV0UU1hbmFnZW1lbnQtI0FkZFVzckFjdA" class="confluence-anchor-link"></span>Add New User Account</span>

For each user that monitors at least one aspect of your data center
network, a user account is needed.

To add a new user account:

1.  Click **Manage** on the User Accounts card.

2.  Click the **User Accounts** tab.

3.  Click **Add User**.
    
    {{% imgOld 2 %}}

4.  Enter the user's email address, along with their first and last
    name.
    
    {{%notice note%}}
    
    Be especially careful entering the email address as you *cannot*
    change it once you save the account. If you save a mistyped email
    address, you must delete the account and create a new one.
    
    {{%/notice%}}

5.  Select the user type: Admin or User.

6.  Enter your password in the Admin Password field (only users with
    administrative permissions can add users).

7.  Create a password for the user.
    
    1.  Enter a password for the user.
    
    2.  Re-enter the user password. If you do not enter a matching
        password, it will be underlined in red.

8.  Click **Save** to create the user account, or **Cancel** to discard
    the user account.  
    By default the User Accounts table is sorted by *User ID*. Change
    the sort by clicking in any of the headers.  
    
    {{% imgOld 3 %}}
    
    {{%notice info%}}
    
    There is only the *admin* role at this time. Any user account you
    create will have administrator permissions.

### Correct a Mistyped User ID (Email Address)</span>

the system uses for authentication. If you need to change an email
address, you must create a new one for this user. Refer to [Add a New
User Account](#src-12321950_NetQManagement-AddUsrAct). You should delete
the incorrect user account. Select the user account, and click

## Manage Scheduled Traces</span>

traces.

### Add a Scheduled Trace</span>

    can be a hostname or IP address, and the destination must be an IP
    address.

    3 trace.

    trace and when to start it the first time.

scheduled validations, or add a new validation.
