This guide is intended for network administrators and operators who are
responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting the network in their data
center environment. NetQ 2.1 offers the ability to easily monitor and
manage your data center network infrastructure and operational health.
This guide provides instructions and information about monitoring
individual components of the network, the network as a whole, and the
NetQ software itself using the NetQ graphical user interface (GUI). If
you prefer to use a command line interface, refer to the [Cumulus NetQ CLI User
Guide](/version/cumulus-netq-21/Cumulus-NetQ-CLI-User-Guide/).
