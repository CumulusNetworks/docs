Cumulus NetQ 2.0.0 through 2.2.1 can be upgraded to the newest NetQ 2.2.2 release.

Two types of upgrades can be performed: an in-place upgrade, or a disk image upgrade. An in-place upgrade does not require you to backup and restore your data (but you may choose to do so), and does not update the NetQ operating system and kernels. A disk image upgrade requires you to backup and restore your data (if you want to keep it), and replaces all NetQ related software on the system.

Cumulus NetQ 1.x versions require a new install.

If you are upgrading from NetQ 2.x software installed on:

- Your own hardware server in an on-premises deployment, please follow the instructions in [Upgrade NetQ Software on Your On-premises Server](../Upgrade-NetQ/Upgrade-NetQ-Software-on-Your-On-premises-Server).
- Your own hardware server in a cloud deployment, please follow the instructions in [Upgrade NetQ Software on Your Cloud Server](../Upgrade-NetQ/Upgrade-NetQ-Software-on-Your-Cloud-Server).
- Your NetQ Appliance, please follow the instructions in [Upgrade NetQ Software on Your NetQ Appliance](../Upgrade-NetQ/Upgrade-NetQ-Software-on-Your-NetQ-Appliance).
- Your NetQ Cloud Appliance, please follow the instructions in [Upgrade NetQ Software on Your NetQ Cloud Appliance](../Upgrade-NetQ/Upgrade-NetQ-Software-on-Your-NetQ-Cloud-Appliance).

If you are upgrading from NetQ 1.4.x (or earlier), please follow the instructions in [Install NetQ](../Install-NetQ/).
