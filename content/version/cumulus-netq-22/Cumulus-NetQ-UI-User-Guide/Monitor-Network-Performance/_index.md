The core capabilities of Cumulus NetQ enable you to monitor your network by viewing performance and configuration data about your individual network devices and the entire fabric network-wide. The topics contained in this section describe monitoring tasks that
apply across the entire network. For device-specific monitoring refer to [Monitor Devices](../Monitor-Devices).
