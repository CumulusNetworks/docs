## <span>Welcome to Cumulus Networks</span>

We are transforming networking with Cumulus Linux, the industry's first,
full-featured Linux operating system for networking hardware. Cumulus
RMP is a network operating system solution that enables out-of-band
management use cases. It provides an open platform for customers and
system integrators to use as is or build rack management applications on
top.

Cumulus RMP shares the same architecture, foundation and user experience
with Cumulus Linux. However, the feature set is customized to the needs
of out-of-band management; for a comparison of the features supported in
Cumulus RMP, see the Cumulus RMP [Features
page](https://cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-rmp/features/).
