## <span>Introducing Cumulus RMP</span>

Cumulus Linux is the networking industry's first full-featured Linux
operating system. The [Debian
Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/)-based,
networking-focused distribution runs on hardware produced by a [broad
partner ecosystem](http://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/), ensuring unmatched
customer choice regarding silicon, optics, cables, and systems.

Cumulus RMP is a network operating system solution that enables
out-of-band management use cases. It provides an open platform for
customers and system integrators to use as is or build rack management
applications on top.

Cumulus RMP shares the same architecture, foundation and user experience
with Cumulus Linux. However, the feature set is customized to the needs
of out-of-band management; for a comparison of the features supported in
Cumulus RMP, see the Cumulus RMP [Features
