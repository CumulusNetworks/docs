The Cumulus VX OVA image is compatible with these hypervisor platforms
provided by VMware:

  - VMware vSphere ESXi (type-I server hypervisor)
  - VMware Fusion (for Mac users)
  - VMware Workstation (for Windows/Linux users)

No matter which VMware hypervisor you use, you use the same Cumulus VX
OVA image. Once you [install the
hypervisor](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads) and [download
the VMware-specific OVA
image](https://cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-vx/download/), you will
import it into the hypervisor, then clone it a few times to create a
two-leaf/two-spine virtual network.

The resulting configuration contains four VMs:

  - Two spine VMs, which represent two spine (aggregation layer)
    switches on the network
  - Two leaf VMs, which represent two leaf (access layer) switches on
    the network
