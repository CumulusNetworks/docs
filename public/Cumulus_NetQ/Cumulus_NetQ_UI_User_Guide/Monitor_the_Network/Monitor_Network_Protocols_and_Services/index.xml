      <description>The Cumulus NetQ UI enables operators to view the health of the BGP service on a network-wide and a per session basis, giving greater insight into all aspects of the service. This is accomplished through two card workflows, one for the service and one for the session. They are described separately here.
Monitor the BGP Service (All Sessions) With NetQ, you can monitor the number of nodes running the BGP service, view switches with the most established and unestablished BGP sessions, and view alarms triggered by the BGP service.</description>
