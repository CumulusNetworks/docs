      <description>The NetQ 2.1 graphical user interface (UI) enables you to access NetQ capabilities through a web browser as opposed to through a terminal window using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Visual representations of the health of the network, inventory, and system events make it easy to both find faults and misconfigurations and to fix them.
The UI is supported on Google Chrome. Other popular browsers may be used, but have not been tested and may have some presentation issues.</description>

      <description>With the NetQ UI, you can monitor individual switches separately from the network. You are able to view the status of services they are running, health of its various components, and connectivity performance. Being able to monitor switch component inventory aids in upgrade, compliance, and other planning tasks. Viewing individual switch health helps isolate performance issues.
For network-wide monitoring, refer to Monitor the Network.
Monitor Switch Performance Viewing detail about a particular switch is essential when troubleshooting performance issues.</description>
