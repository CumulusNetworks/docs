      <title>Spanning Tree and Rapid Spanning Tree</title>

      <description>Spanning tree protocol (STP) is always recommended in layer 2 topologies as it prevents bridge loops and broadcast radiation on a bridged network. STP also provides redundant links for automatic failover when an active link fails. STP is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux.
Supported Modes The STP modes Cumulus Linux supports vary depending upon whether the traditional or VLAN-aware bridge driver mode is in use.
 Bridges configured in VLAN-aware mode operate only in RSTP mode.</description>

      <title>Bonding - Link Aggregation</title>

      <description>Linux bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces (slaves) into a single logical bonded interface (bond). Cumulus Linux supports two bonding modes:
 IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation mode, which allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group (LAG), so that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. IEEE 802.</description>

      <title>Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation - MLAG</title>
      <link>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG/</link>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Multi-Chassis-Link-Aggregation-MLAG/</guid>
      <description>Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) enables a server or switch with a two-port bond, such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel, port group or trunk, to connect those ports to different switches and operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput.
MLAG or CLAG?
The Cumulus Linux implementation of MLAG is referred to by other vendors as CLAG, MC-LAG or VPC.</description>

      <title>LACP Bypass</title>
      <link>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/LACP-Bypass/</link>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/LACP-Bypass/</guid>
      <description>On Cumulus Linux, LACP Bypass is a feature that allows a bond configured in 802.3ad mode to become active and forward traffic even when there is no LACP partner. A typical use case for this feature is to enable a host, without the capability to run LACP, to PXE boot while connected to a switch on a bond configured in 802.3ad mode. Once the pre-boot process finishes and the host is capable of running LACP, the normal 802.</description>

      <title>Virtual Router Redundancy - VRR and VRRP</title>
      <link>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Virtual-Router-Redundancy-VRR-and-VRRP/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Virtual-Router-Redundancy-VRR-and-VRRP/</guid>
      <description>Cumulus Linux provides the option of using Virtual Router Redundancy (VRR) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).
VRR enables hosts to communicate with any redundant router without reconfiguration, running dynamic router protocols, or running router redundancy protocols. This means that redundant routers respond to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests from hosts. Routers are configured to respond in an identical manner, but if one fails, the other redundant routers continue to respond, leaving the hosts with the impression that nothing has changed.</description>

      <title>IGMP and MLD Snooping</title>
      <link>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/IGMP-and-MLD-Snooping/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/IGMP-and-MLD-Snooping/</guid>
      <description>IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) snooping are implemented in the bridge driver in the Cumulus Linux kernel and are enabled by default. IGMP snooping processes IGMP v1/v2/v3 reports received on a bridge port in a bridge to identify the hosts which would like to receive multicast traffic destined to that group.
In Cumulus Linux 3.7.4 and later, IGMP and MLD snooping is supported over VXLAN bridges on Broadcom switches; however, this feature is not enabled by default.</description>
