      <description>NetQ provides users with the ability to go back in time to replay the network state, see fabric-wide event change logs and root cause state deviations. The NetQ Telemetry Server maintains data collected by NetQ agents in a time-series database, making fabric-wide events available for analysis. This enables you to replay and analyze network-wide events for better visibility and to correlate patterns. This allows for root-cause analysis and optimization of network configs for the future.</description>

      <description>This topic outlines a few scenarios that illustrate how you use NetQ to troubleshoot MLAG on Cumulus Linux switches. Each starts with a log message that indicates the current MLAG state.
NetQ can monitor many aspects of an MLAG configuration, including:
 Verifying the current state of all nodes Verifying the dual connectivity state Checking that the peer link is part of the bridge Verifying whether MLAG bonds are not bridge members Verifying whether the VXLAN interface is not a bridge member Checking for remote-side service failures caused by systemctl Checking for VLAN-VNI mapping mismatches Checking for layer 3 MTU mismatches on peerlink subinterfaces Checking for VXLAN active-active address inconsistencies Verifying that STP priorities are the same across both peers  Scenario: All Nodes Are Up When the MLAG configuration is running smoothly, NetQ sends out a message that all nodes are up:</description>

      <description>There are several paths you can take to locate and investigate issues that occur in the NetQ software itself, including viewing configuration and log files, verifying NetQ Agent health, and verifying NetQ Platform configuration. If these do not produce a resolution, you can capture a log to use in discussion with Cumulus Networks support team.
Browse Configuration and Log Files To aid in troubleshooting issues with NetQ, there are the following configuration and log files that can provide insight into the root cause of the issue:</description>
