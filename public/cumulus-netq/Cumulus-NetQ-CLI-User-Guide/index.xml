      <description>A variety of resources are available for you to become familiar with Cumulus NetQ and to take advantage of its monitoring and analytic capabilities. These resources are identified here along with information about how the content is presented.
What&amp;rsquo;s New in Cumulus NetQ 2.2 Cumulus NetQ is now available as a cloud service, making it even easier to scale with your network growth. Just like Cumulus NetQ deployed in your premises, real-time data collection and fabric-wide performance analysis are available through the cloud service.</description>

      <description>The NetQ CLI provides access to all of the network state and event information collected by the NetQ Agents. It behaves the same way most CLIs behave, with groups of commands used to display related information, the ability to use TAB completion when entering commands, and to get help for given commands and options. The commands are grouped into four categories: check and show, agent and notifier, trace, and resolve.</description>

      <description>NetQ provides the information you need to monitor the health of your network fabric, devices, and interfaces. You are able to easily validate the operation and view the configuration across the entire network from switches to hosts to containers. For example, you can monitor the operation of routing protocols and virtual network configurations, the status of NetQ Agents and hardware components, and the operation and efficiency of interfaces. When issues are present, NetQ makes it easy to identify and resolve them.</description>

      <description>With NetQ, a network administrator can monitor both the switch hardware and software components for misconfigurations. NetQ helps answer questions such as:
 What switches do I have in the network? What hardware and software are installed on my switches? Are all switches licensed correctly? Do all switches have NetQ agents running?  NetQ uses LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) to collect port information. NetQ can also identify peer ports connected to DACs (Direct Attached Cables) and AOCs (Active Optical Cables) without using LLDP, even if the link is not UP.</description>

Keeping track of the various data link layer devices in your network ensures consistent and error-free communications between devices. NetQ provides the ability to:
 Monitor and validate device and protocol configurations
 View available communication paths between devices
  It helps answer questions such as:</description>

      <description>Running NetQ on Linux hosts provides unprecedented network visibility, giving the network operator a complete view of the entire infastrucutreâ€™s network connectivity instead of just from the network devices.
The NetQ Agent is supported on the following Linux hosts:
 CentOS 7 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Ubuntu 16.04  You need to install the OS-specific NetQ metapack on every host you want to monitor with NetQ.
The NetQ Agent monitors the following on Linux hosts:</description>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq/Cumulus-NetQ-CLI-User-Guide/Monitor-Container-Environments/</guid>
      <description>The NetQ Agent monitors container environments the same way it monitors physical servers. There is no special implementation. The NetQ Agent pulls data from the container as it would pull data from a Cumulus Linux switch or Linux host. It can be installed on a Linux server or in a Linux VM. NetQ Agent integrates with the Kubernetes container orchestrator.
NetQ monitors many aspects of containers on your network, including their:</description>

      <description>At various points in time, you might want to change which network nodes are being monitored by NetQ or look more closely at a network node for troubleshooting purposes. Adding the NetQ Agent to a switch or host is described in Install NetQ. Disabling an Agent is described here and managing NetQ Agent logging is also presented.
Modify the Configuration of the NetQ Agent on a Node The agent configuration commands enable you to add and remove agents from switches and hosts, start and stop agent operations, add and remove Kubernetes container monitoring, add or remove sensors, debug the agent, and add or remove FRR (FRRouting).</description>

      <title>Early Access Features</title>
      <link>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq/Cumulus-NetQ-CLI-User-Guide/Early-Access-Features/</link>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq/Cumulus-NetQ-CLI-User-Guide/Early-Access-Features/</guid>
      <description>NetQ has early access features that provide advanced access to new functionality before it becomes generally available. The ability to view physical interface statistics collected by the NetQ Agent is the only early access feature available in NetQ 2.2.x.
This feature is bundled into the netq-apps package; there is no specific EA package like there typically is with Cumulus Linux.
Enable Early Access Features You enable early access features by running the netq config add experimental command on any node running NetQ.</description>
