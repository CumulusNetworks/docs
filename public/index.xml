      <title>Accessing the Console</title>
      <link>http://example.org/Chassis/Accessing_the_Console/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/Chassis/Accessing_the_Console/</guid>
      <description>You access the console slightly differently, depending upon whether your chassis is a Backpack or the CX-10256-S/OMP-800.
Accessing the Console on a Backpack Chassis Every CPU in the chassis has its own console. However, for design simplicity, console access is multiplexed, so the only console ports are on the chassis management modules (CMMs) and system controller modules (SCMs).
Accessing a Console through a CMM Each CMM has an RJ45 port for console access.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/version/Cumulus_Linux_301/Cumulus_Linux_301/</guid>
      <description>Cumulus Linux 3.0.1 includes bug fixes only.
Cumulus Linux 3.0 has a host of new features and capabilities. In addition to this chapter, please read the release notes to learn about known issues with this release.
Cumulus Linux 3.0 includes these new features and platforms:
 Debian Jessie (upgraded from Debian Wheezy)

      <title>Fabric Port, Line Card and Switch Port Interfaces</title>
      <link>http://example.org/Chassis/Fabric_Port_Line_Card_and_Switch_Port_Interfaces/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/Chassis/Fabric_Port_Line_Card_and_Switch_Port_Interfaces/</guid>
      <description>Each line card in the chassis contains 64 100G ports, broken down into 32 switch ports, which connect to an external network, and 32 fabric ports, which connect to the fabric cards. Because each line card has two Tomahawk ASICs, each line card actually is two switches. On the Backpack chassis, one ASIC is on the left side of the line card and one is on the right side; each half of the line card has half of the switch ports and half of the fabric ports.</description>

      <description>Hugo Shortcodes Markdown is designed for speed and simplicity, therefore limited in authoring and customizing rendered content. Rather than insert raw HTML into markdown, Hugo provides Shortcodes, predefined templates callable from markdown content.
Hugo provides some built-in shortcodes, for some standard use cases. The Hugo documentation for built-in shortcodes is located here Included in this theme is a set of custom shortcodes, built for documentation. Use of these shortcodes are explained below</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/Chassis/Chassis_Default_Configurations/</guid>
      <description>A number of configuration files are automatically applied to all the nodes in the chassis the first time you boot it after installing Cumulus Linux on the nodes. These following actions are also performed:
 Enable Zebra and bgpd for FRR in the /etc/frr/daemons file.
 Create the default FRR configuration in the /etc/frr/frr.conf file; iBGP is used. The default configuration uses the ASN 4242424242 to make it easy to recognize.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/Chassis/Monitoring_and_Troubleshooting_a_Chassis/</guid>
      <description>Typically you use standard methods to monitor and troubleshoot the chassis. However, some commands work a little differently and there are some chassis-specific commands you can utilize. Those differences are discussed in this chapter.
Generating the cl-support Script If you&amp;rsquo;re submitting a ticket to the Cumulus Networks support team for an issue with the chassis, you can generate the cl-support script for a specific node in the chassis by specifying the IPv6 address of the node in the cl-chassis command:</description>

      <description>In general, you use the same Cumulus Linux or Debian Linux commands on the chassis that you would use on any other Cumulus Linux switch. However, there is a new suite of commands called cl-chassis. In addition, SSH works a little differently within a chassis.
cl-chassis Commands Cumulus Linux has a number of chassis-specific commands that can execute against one or all cards in the chassis. The cl-chassis command provides options for:</description>

      <description>The NetQ CLI provides access to all of the network state and event information collected by the NetQ Agents. It behaves the same way most CLIs behave, with groups of commands used to display related information, the ability to use TAB completion when entering commands, and to get help for given commands and options. The commands are grouped into four categories: check and show, agent and notifier, trace, and resolve.</description>

Commands  apt-get
 apt-cache
 dpkg
  Updating the Package Cache To work properly, APT relies on a local cache of the available packages. You must populate the cache initially, and then periodically update it with apt-get update:

      <description>This topic discusses how to install a new Cumulus Linux disk image using ONIE, an open source project (equivalent to PXE on servers) that enables the installation of network operating systems (NOS) on bare metal switches.
Before you install Cumulus Linux, the switch can be in two different states:
 No image is installed on the switch (the switch is only running ONIE).
 Cumulus Linux is already installed on the switch but you want to use ONIE to reinstall Cumulus Linux or upgrade to a newer version.</description>

 DHCP/a web server with DHCP options
 DHCP/a web server without DHCP options
 A web server with no DHCP</description>

      <description>This topic describes how to upgrade Cumulus Linux on your switches to a more recent release.
Cumulus Networks recommends that you deploy, provision, configure, and upgrade switches using automation, even with small networks or test labs. During the upgrade process, you can quickly upgrade dozens of devices in a repeatable manner. Using tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for configuration management greatly increases the speed and accuracy of the next major upgrade; these tools also enable the quick swap of failed switch hardware.</description>

      <description>Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) enables network devices to be quickly deployed in large-scale environments. Data center engineers only need to rack and stack the switch, install Cumulus Linux via ONIE, then connect the switch to the management network — or alternatively, insert a USB stick and boot the switch. From here, the provisioning process can start automatically and deploy a configuration.
The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed.</description>

The switchd configuration is stored in /etc/cumulus/switchd.conf.
Versions of Cumulus Linux prior to 2.1 stored the switchd configuration at /etc/default/switchd.
 The switchd File System switchd also exports a file system, mounted on /cumulus/switchd, that presents all the switchd configuration options as a series of files arranged in a tree structure.</description>

      <description>Installing NetQ can be accomplished in one of three ways:
 If you have purchased a NetQ Appliance, the only installation required is to load the NetQ Agent on any host you want to monitor.
 If you already have a Cumulus Linux switch (running version 3.3.0 or later) and you want to add NetQ functionality to it, installation involves three steps:
 Verify your server meets the hardware and software requirements.</description>

      <description>Services (also known as daemons) and processes are at the heart of how a Linux system functions. Most of the time a service takes care of itself; you just enable and start it, then let it run. However, because a Cumulus Linux switch is a Linux system, you have the ability to dig deeper if you like. Services may start multiple processes as they run. Services tend to be the most important things to monitor on a Cumulus Linux switch.</description>

      <description>You configure global HTTP and HTTPS proxies in the /etc/profile.d/ directory of Cumulus Linux. To do so, set the http_proxy and https_proxy variables, which tells the switch the address of the proxy server to use to fetch URLs on the command line. This is useful for programs such as apt/apt-get, curl and wget, which can all use this proxy.
 In a terminal, create a new file in the /etc/profile.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux implements an HTTP application programing interface to OpenStack ML2 driver and NCLU. Rather than accessing Cumulus Linux using SSH, you can interact with the switch using an HTTP client, such as cURL, HTTPie or a web browser.
The HTTP API service is enabled by default on chassis hardware only. However, the associated server is configured to only listen to traffic originating from within the chassis.
The service is not enabled by default on non-chassis hardware.</description>

      <description>Hardware datapath configuration manages packet buffering, queueing, and scheduling in hardware. There are two configuration input files:
 /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf, which describes priority groups and assigns the scheduling algorithm and weights
 /etc/bcm.d/datapath/datapath.conf, which assigns buffer space and egress queues
  Versions of these files prior to Cumulus Linux 2.1 are incompatible with Cumulus Linux 2.1 and later; using older files will cause switchd to fail to start and return an error that it cannot find the /var/lib/cumulus/rc.</description>

      <description>The NetQ 2.1 graphical user interface (UI) enables you to access NetQ capabilities through a web browser as opposed to through a terminal window using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Visual representations of the health of the network, inventory, and system events make it easy to both find faults and misconfigurations and to fix them.
The UI is supported on Google Chrome. Other popular browsers may be used, but have not been tested and may have some presentation issues.</description>

      <description>Spanning tree protocol (STP) is always recommended in layer 2 topologies, as it prevents bridge loops and broadcast radiation on a bridged network.
The mstpd daemon is an open source project used by Cumulus Linux to implement IEEE802.1D 2004 and IEEE802.1Q 2011. mstpctl is the utility provided by the mstpd service to configure STP. STP is disabled by default on bridges in Cumulus Linux.

      <description>The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides a method of authenticating a client (called a supplicant) over wired media. It also provides access for individual MAC addresses on a switch (called the authenticator) after those MAC addresses have been authenticated by an authentication server — typically a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service, defined by RFC 2865) server.
A Cumulus Linux switch acts as an intermediary between the clients connected to the wired ports and the authentication server, which is reachable over the existing network.</description>

      <description>Facebook Voyager is a Broadcom Tomahawk-based switch with added Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) ports that can connect to another switch thousands of kilometers away by adding transponders. DWDM allows many separate connections on one fiber pair by sending them over different wavelengths. Although the wavelengths are sent on the same physical fiber, they do not interact with each other, similar to VLANs on a trunk. Each wavelength can transport very high speeds over very long distances.</description>

      <description>The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides a method of authenticating a client (called a supplicant) over wired media. It also provides access for individual MAC addresses on a switch (called the authenticator) after those MAC addresses have been authenticated by an authentication server — typically a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service, defined by RFC 2865) server.
A Cumulus Linux switch acts as an intermediary between the clients connected to the wired ports and the authentication server, which is reachable over the existing network.</description>

      <description>Linux bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces (the slaves) into a single logical bonded interface (the bond). Cumulus Linux bonding supports the IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation mode. Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group (LAG), such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. The benefits of link aggregation are:</description>

      <description>NetQ provides users with the ability to go back in time to replay the network state, see fabric-wide event change logs and root cause state deviations. The NetQ Telemetry Server maintains data collected by NetQ agents in a time-series database, making fabric-wide events available for analysis. This enables you to replay and analyze network-wide events for better visibility and to correlate patterns. This allows for root-cause analysis and optimization of network configs for the future.</description>

      <description>Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation, or MLAG, enables a server or switch with a two-port bond (such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel, port group, or trunk) to connect those ports to different switches and operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput.
Dual-connected devices can create LACP bonds that contain links to each physical switch. Thus, active-active links from the dual-connected devices are supported even though they are connected to two different physical switches.</description>

      <description>On Cumulus Linux, LACP Bypass is a feature that allows a bond configured in 802.3ad mode to become active and forward traffic even when there is no LACP partner. A typical use case for this feature is to enable a host, without the capability to run LACP, to PXE boot while connected to a switch on a bond configured in 802.3ad mode. Once the pre-boot process finishes and the host is capable of running LACP, the normal 802.</description>

NetQ can monitor many aspects of an MLAG configuration, including:
 Verifying the current state of all nodes
 Verifying the dual connectivity state
 Checking that the peer link is part of the bridge
 Verifying whether MLAG bonds are not bridge members</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/Cumulus_Linux/Layer_2/Multi-Chassis_Link_Aggregation_-_MLAG/</guid>
      <description>Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG), enables a server or switch with a two-port bond, such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel, port group or trunk, to connect those ports to different switches and operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput.
The Cumulus Linux implementation of MLAG is referred to by other vendors as CLAG, MC-LAG or VPC. You will even see references to CLAG in Cumulus Linux, including the management daemon, named clagd, and other options in the code, such as clag-id, which exist for historical purposes.</description>

      <description>On Cumulus Linux, LACP Bypass is a feature that allows a bond configured in 802.3ad mode to become active and forward traffic even when there is no LACP partner. A typical use case for this feature is to enable a host, without the capability to run LACP, to PXE boot while connected to a switch on a bond configured in 802.3ad mode. Once the pre-boot process finishes and the host is capable of running LACP, the normal 802.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux provides the option of using Virtual Router Redundancy (VRR) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).
VRR enables hosts to communicate with any redundant router without reconfiguration, running dynamic router protocols, or running router redundancy protocols. This means that redundant routers respond to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests from hosts. Routers are configured to respond in an identical manner, but if one fails, the other redundant routers continue to respond, leaving the hosts with the impression that nothing has changed.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses the various routing protocols, and how to configure them.
Defining Routing Protocols A routing protocol dynamically computes reachability between various end points. This enables communication to work around link and node failures, and additions and withdrawals of various addresses.
IP routing protocols are typically distributed; that is, an instance of the routing protocol runs on each of the routers in a network.
Cumulus Linux does not support running multiple instances of the same protocol on a router.</description>

      <description>Two event workflows, the Alarms card workflow and the Info card workflow, provide a view into the events occurring in the network. The Alarms card workflow tracks critical severity events, whereas the Info card workflow tracks all warning, info, and debug severity events.
To focus on events from a single device perspective, refer to Monitor Switches .

      <description>In computer networks, topology refers to the structure of interconnecting various nodes. Some commonly used topologies in networks are star, hub and spoke, leaf and spine, and broadcast.
Clos Topologies In the vast majority of modern data centers, Clos or fat tree topology is very popular. This topology is shown in the figure below. It is also commonly referred to as leaf-spine topology. We shall use this topology throughout the routing protocol guide.</description>

      <description>It is helpful to verify that communications are freely flowing between the various devices in your network. You can verify the connectivity between two devices currently or for a time in the past. You can also view connectivity in both an adhoc fashion and specifically define connectivity checks to occur on a scheduled basis. There are three card workflows which enable you to view connectivity, the Trace Request, On-demand Trace Results, and Scheduled Trace Results.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux uses quagga, an open source routing software suite, to provide the routing protocols for dynamic routing. Cumulus Linux supports the l atest Quagga version, 0.99.23.1+cl3.0  . Quagga is a fork of the GNU Zebra project.
Quagga provides many routing protocols, of which Cumulus Linux supports the following:
 Open Shortest Path First (v2 and v3)
 Border Gateway Protocol

      <description>OSPFv2 is a link-state routing protocol for IPv4. OSPF maintains the view of the network topology conceptually as a directed graph. Each router represents a vertex in the graph. Each link between neighboring routers represents a unidirectional edge. Each link has an associated weight (called cost) that is either automatically derived from its bandwidth or administratively assigned. Using the weighted topology graph, each router computes a shortest path tree (SPT) with itself as the root, and applies the results to build its forwarding table.</description>

      <description>OSPFv3 is a revised version of OSPFv2 to support the IPv6 address family. Refer to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol for a discussion on the basic concepts, which remain the same between the two versions.
OSPFv3 has changed the formatting in some of the packets and LSAs either as a necessity to support IPv6 or to improve the protocol behavior based on OSPFv2 experience. Most notably, v3 defines a new LSA, called intra-area prefix LSA to separate out the advertisement of stub networks attached to a router from the router LSA.</description>

      <description>BGP is the routing protocol that runs the Internet. It is an increasingly popular protocol for use in the data center as it lends itself well to the rich interconnections in a Clos topology. Specifically:
 It does not require routing state to be periodically refreshed unlike OSPF.
 It is less chatty than its link-state siblings. For example, a link or node transition can result in a bestpath change, causing BGP to send updates.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux supports hardware-based equal cost multipath (ECMP) load sharing. ECMP is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux. Load sharing occurs automatically for all routes with multiple next hops installed. ECMP load sharing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.
Understanding Equal Cost Routing ECMP operates only on equal cost routes in the Linux routing table.
In this example, the 10.1.1.0/24 route has two possible next hops that have been installed in the routing table:</description>

      <description>VXLAN routing, sometimes referred to as inter-VXLAN routing, provides IP routing between VXLAN VNIs in overlay networks. The routing of traffic is based on the inner header or the overlay tenant IP address.
Because VXLAN routing is fundamentally routing, it is most commonly deployed with a control plane, such as Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN). You can set up static routing too, either with or without the Cumulus Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV) for MAC distribution and BUM handling.</description>

      <description>Redistribute neighbor provides a mechanism for IP subnets to span racks without forcing the end hosts to run a routing protocol.
The fundamental premise behind redistribute neighbor is to announce individual host /32 routes in the routed fabric. Other hosts on the fabric can then use this new path to access the hosts in the fabric. If multiple equal-cost paths (ECMP) are available, traffic can load balance across the available paths natively.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

      <description>QinQ is an amendment to the IEEE 802.1Q specification that provides the capability for multiple VLAN tags to be inserted into a single Ethernet frame.
The primary use case for QinQ with VXLAN is where a service provider who offers multi-tenant layer 2 connectivity between different customers’ data centers (private clouds) may also need to connect those data centers to public cloud providers. Public clouds often has a mandatory QinQ handoff interface, where the outer tag is for the customer and the inner tag is for the service.</description>

      <description>Management VRF — a subset of VRF (virtual routing tables and forwarding) — provides a separation between the out-of-band management network and the in-band data plane network. For all VRFs, the main routing table is the default table for all of the data plane switch ports. With management VRF, a second table, mgmt, is used for routing through eth0.
Cumulus Linux only supports eth0 as the management interface. VLAN subinterfaces, bonds, bridges and the front panel switch ports are not supported as management interfaces.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses the various routing protocols, and how to configure them.
Defining Routing Protocols A routing protocol dynamically computes reachability between various end points. This enables communication to work around link and node failures, and additions and withdrawals of various addresses.
IP routing protocols are typically distributed; that is, an instance of the routing protocol runs on each of the routers in a network.
Cumulus Linux does not support running multiple instances of the same protocol on a router.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/version/Cumulus_Linux_301/Monitoring_and_Troubleshooting/Cumulus_Linux_301/Monitoring_and_Troubleshooting/</guid>
      <description>You can use cl-resource-queryto retrieve information about host entries, MAC entries, L2 and L3 routes, and ECMPs (equal-cost multi-path routes, see Load Balancing) that are in use. This is especially useful because Cumulus Linux syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.
In order to avoid this, routes in the hardware should be monitored and kept below the ASIC limits.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses routing on switches running Cumulus Linux.
Managing Static Routes You manage static routes using NCLU or the Cumulus Linux ip route command. The routes are added to the FRRouting routing table, and are then updated into the kernel routing table as well.
To add a static route, run:
 cumulus@switch:~$ net add routing route 203.0.113.0/24 198.51.100.2 cumulus@switch:~$ net pending cumulus@switch:~$ net commit  These commands create the following configuration in the /etc/frr/frr.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses the various routing protocols, and how to configure them.
Defining Routing Protocols A routing protocol dynamically computes reachability between various end points. This enables communication to work around link and node failures, and additions and withdrawals of various addresses.
IP routing protocols are typically distributed; that is, an instance of the routing protocol runs on each of the routers in a network.
Cumulus Linux does not support running multiple instances of the same protocol on a router.</description>

      <description>OSPFv2 is a link-state routing protocol for IPv4. OSPF maintains the view of the network topology conceptually as a directed graph. Each router represents a vertex in the graph. Each link between neighboring routers represents a unidirectional edge. Each link has an associated weight (called cost) that is either automatically derived from its bandwidth or administratively assigned. Using the weighted topology graph, each router computes a shortest path tree (SPT) with itself as the root, and applies the results to build its forwarding table.</description>

OSPFv3 has changed the formatting in some of the packets and LSAs either as a necessity to support IPv6 or to improve the protocol behavior based on OSPFv2 experience. Most notably, v3 defines a new LSA, called intra-area prefix LSA to separate out the advertisement of stub networks attached to a router from the router LSA.</description>

 Does not require routing state to be periodically refreshed, unlike OSPF.
 Is less chatty than its link-state siblings. For example, a link or node transition can result in a bestpath change, causing BGP to send updates.</description>

      <description>OSPF maintains the view of the network topology conceptually as a directed graph. Each router represents a vertex in the graph. Each link between neighboring routers represents a unidirectional edge and each link has an associated weight (called cost) that is either automatically derived from its bandwidth or administratively assigned. Using the weighted topology graph, each router computes a shortest path tree (SPT) with itself as the root, and applies the results to build its forwarding table.</description>

      <description>OSPFv3 is a revised version of OSPFv2 to support the IPv6 address family. Refer to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol for a discussion on the basic concepts, which remain the same between the two versions.
OSPFv3 has changed the formatting in some of the packets and LSAs either as a necessity to support IPv6 or to improve the protocol behavior based on OSPFv2 experience. Most notably, v3 defines a new LSA, called intra-area prefix LSA to separate out the advertisement of stub networks attached to a router from the router LSA.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/version/Cumulus_Linux_36/Layer_3/Policy-based_Routing/</guid>
      <description>Typical routing systems and protocols forward traffic based on the destination address in the packet, which is used to look up an entry in a routing table. However, sometimes the traffic on your network requires a more hands-on approach. You might need to forward a packet based on the source address, the packet size, or other information in the packet header.
Policy-based routing (PBR) lets you make routing decisions based on filters that change the routing behavior of specific traffic so that you can override the routing table and influence where the traffic goes.</description>

      <description>Redistribute neighbor provides a mechanism for IP subnets to span racks without forcing the end hosts to run a routing protocol.
The fundamental premise behind redistribute neighbor is to announce individual host /32 routes in the routed fabric. Other hosts on the fabric can then use this new path to access the hosts in the fabric. If multiple equal-cost paths (ECMP) are available, traffic can load balance across the available paths natively.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

      <description>BGP is the routing protocol that runs the Internet. It is an increasingly popular protocol for use in the data center as it lends itself well to the rich interconnections in a Clos topology. Specifically, BGP:
 Does not require the routing state to be periodically refreshed, unlike OSPF.
 Is less chatty than its link-state siblings. For example, a link or node transition can result in a bestpath change, causing BGP to send updates.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

      <description>Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a multicast control plane protocol, that advertises multicast sources and receivers over a routed layer 3 network. Layer 3 multicast relies on PIM to advertise information about multicast capable routers and the location of multicast senders and receivers. For this reason, multicast cannot be sent through a routed network without PIM.
PIM has two modes of operation: Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Dense Mode (PIM-DM).</description>

      <description>GRE Tunneling is an early access feature in Cumulus Linux 3.6.
 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that encapsulates network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol network. The two endpoints are identified by the tunnel source and tunnel destination addresses at each endpoint.
GRE packets travel directly between the two endpoints through a virtual tunnel. As a packet comes across other routers, there is no interaction with its payload; the routers only parse the outer IP packet.</description>

      <description>Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a multicast control plane protocol that advertises multicast sources and receivers over a routed layer 3 network. Layer 3 multicast relies on PIM to advertise information about multicast capable routers, and the location of multicast senders and receivers. For this reason, multicast cannot be sent through a routed network without PIM.
PIM has two modes of operation: Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Dense Mode (PIM-DM).</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/Cumulus_Linux/Layer_3/GRE_Tunneling/</guid>
      <description>GRE Tunneling is an early access feature.
 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that encapsulates network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol network. The two endpoints are identified by the tunnel source and tunnel destination addresses at each endpoint.
GRE packets travel directly between the two endpoints through a virtual tunnel. As a packet comes across other routers, there is no interaction with its payload; the routers only parse the outer IP packet.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/version/Cumulus_Linux_36/Layer_3/Segment_Routing/</guid>
      <description>Cumulus Linux supports segment routing, also known as source routing, which provides the ability for a source node to specify the path a packet should take (traffic engineering). In some more advanced cases, you can use segment routing to have offline multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) controllers program labels into the network for traffic engineering.
Cumulus Linux provides full label-based forwarding, relying on BGP for label exchange. However, Cumulus Linux does not provide LDP interoperability for MPLS and it does not support VRFs for tenant isolation.</description>

      <description>Before you install Cumulus Linux, the switch can be in two different states:
 The switch has no image on it (so the switch is only running ONIE) or you desire or require a clean installation. In this case, you can install Cumulus Linux in one of the following ways, using:
 DHCP/a Web server with DHCP options
 DHCP/a Web server without DHCP options
 A Web server with no DHCP</description>

This is especially useful because Cumulus Linux syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks software melds the Linux host world with the networking devices world. Each world comes with its own paradigm on how to upgrade software. Before we discuss the various ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux switches, let&amp;rsquo;s review the general considerations and strategies used to upgrade network devices and Linux hosts.
Upgrades: Comparing the Network Device Worldview vs. the Linux Host Worldview Manual vs. Automated Configuration Historically, network devices were configured in place, and most network devices required customized configurations, which led predominantly to configuring the hardware manually.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) and Name Service Switch (NSS) for user authentication.
NSS specifies the order of information sources used to resolve names for each service. Using this with authentication and authorization, it provides the order and location used for user lookup and group mapping on the system. PAM handles the interaction between the user and the system, providing login handling, session setup, authentication of users and authorization of a user actions.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

The ML2 framework simplifies adding support for new layer 2 networking technologies, requiring much less initial and ongoing effort — specifically, it enables dynamic provisioning of VLAN/VXLAN on switches in OpenStack environment instead of manually provisioning L2 connectivity for each VM.
The plugin supports configuration caching. The cached configuration is replayed back to the Cumulus Linux switch from Cumulus ML2 mechanism driver when a switch or process restart is detected.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks&amp;rsquo; Routing on the Host provides the ability to run OSPF or BGP directly on server hosts. This can enable a network architecture known as anycast, where many servers can provide the same service without needing layer 2 extensions or load balancer appliances.
Anycast is not a new protocol or protocol implementation and does not require any additional network configuration. Anycast leverages the equal cost multipath (ECMP) capabilities inherent in layer 3 networks to provide stateless load sharing services.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux seamlessly integrates with the MidoNet OpenStack infrastructure, where the switches provide the VTEP gateway for terminating VXLAN tunnels from within MidoNet. MidoNet connects to the OVSDB server running on the Cumulus Linux switch, and exchanges information about the VTEPs and MAC addresses associated with the OpenStack Neutron networks. This provides seamless Ethernet connectivity between virtual and physical server infrastructures.

      <description>The Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin is a framework that allows OpenStack Networking to utilize a variety of non-vendor-specific layer 2 networking technologies. The ML2 framework simplifies adding support for new layer 2 networking technologies, requiring much less initial and ongoing effort — specifically, it enables dynamic provisioning of VLAN/VXLAN on switches in OpenStack environment instead of manually provisioning L2 connectivity for each VM.
The plugin supports configuration caching. The cached configuration is replayed back to the Cumulus Linux switch from Cumulus ML2 mechanism driver when a switch or process restart is detected.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks&amp;rsquo; Routing on the Host provides the ability to run OSPF or BGP directly on server hosts. This can enable a network architecture known as anycast, where many servers can provide the same service without needing layer 2 extensions or load balancer appliances.
Anycast is not a new protocol or protocol implementation and does not require any additional network configuration. Anycast leverages the equal cost multipath (ECMP) capabilities inherent in layer 3 networks to provide stateless load sharing services.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux includes native Linux VXLAN kernel support.
Requirements A VXLAN configuration requires a switch with a Tomahawk, Trident II+ or Trident II chipset running Cumulus Linux 2.0 or later.
For a basic VXLAN configuration, you should ensure that:
 The VXLAN has a network identifier (VNI); do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values under Cumulus Linux.
 The VXLAN link and local interfaces are added to bridge to create the association between port, VLAN and VXLAN instance.</description>

      <description>By default, Cumulus Linux has two user accounts: root and cumulus. The cumulus account is a normal user and is in the group sudo.
You can add more user accounts as needed. Like the cumulus account, these accounts must use sudo to execute privileged commands.
sudo Basics sudo allows you to execute a command as superuser or another user as specified by the security policy. See man sudo(8) for details.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/Cumulus_Linux/System_Configuration/Authentication_Authorization_and_Accounting/LDAP_Authentication_and_Authorization/</guid>
      <description>Cumulus Linux uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) and Name Service Switch (NSS) for user authentication.
NSS specifies the order of information sources used to resolve names for each service. Using this with authentication and authorization, it provides the order and location used for user lookup and group mapping on the system. PAM handles the interaction between the user and the system, providing login handling, session setup, authentication of users, and authorization of user actions.</description>

      <description>You can generate authentication keys to access a Cumulus Linux switch securely with the ssh-keygen component of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. Cumulus Linux uses the OpenSSH package to provide this functionality. This section describes how to generate an SSH key pair.
Generating an SSH Key Pair  To generate the SSH key pair, run the ssh-keygen command and follow the prompts:
To configure a completely passwordless system, do not enter a passphrase when prompted in the following step.</description>

      <description>The only real unique entity for logging on Cumulus Linux compared to any other Linux distribution is switchd.log, which logs the HAL (hardware abstraction layer) from hardware like the Broadcom or Mellanox ASIC.
This guide on NixCraft is amazing for understanding how /var/log works. The green highlighted rows below are the most important logs and usually looked at first when debugging.

      <description>On Broadcom switches, a MAC address is learned on a bridge regardless of whether or not a received packet is dropped by an ACL. This is due to how the hardware learns MAC addresses and occurs before the ACL lookup. This can be a security or resource problem as the MAC address table has the potential to get filled with bogus MAC addresses, so a malfunctioning host, network error, loop or malicious attack on a shared L2 platform can create an outage for other hosts if the same MAC address is learned on another port.</description>

      <description>In Cumulus Linux, a voice VLAN is a VLAN dedicated to voice traffic on a switch port. However, the term can mean different things to different vendors.
Voice VLAN is part of a trunk port with 2 VLANs that comprises either:
 Native VLAN, which carries both data and voice traffic, or
 Voice VLAN, which carries the voice traffic, and a data or native VLAN, which carries the data traffic in a trunk port.</description>

      <description>It is crucial to also protect a switch’s control plane to ensure the proper control plane applications have access to the switch’s CPU. Failure to do so could increase vulnerabilities to a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. Cumulus Linux provides control plane protection by default. It also offers a DDOS protection mechanism, which protects data plane, control plane and management plane traffic in the switch. It drops any packets that match one or more of the following criteria while incurring no performance impact:</description>

      <description>Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV) is a technique for deploying VXLANs without a central controller on bare metal switches. This a full example complete with diagram. Please reference the Lightweight Network Virtualization chapter for more detailed information. This full example uses the recommended way of deploying LNV, which is to use Anycast to load balance the service nodes.
LNV is a lightweight controller option. Please contact Cumulus Networks with your scale requirements and we can make sure this is the right fit for you.</description>

      <description>The Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>This article shows two examples of VLAN tagging, one basic and one more advanced. They both demonstrate the streamlined interface configuration from ifupdown2.
VLAN Tagging, a Basic Example A simple configuration demonstrating VLAN tagging involves two hosts connected to a switch.
 host1 connects to swp1 with both untagged frames and with 802.1Q frames tagged for vlan100.
 host2 connects to swp2 with 802.1Q frames tagged for vlan120 and vlan130.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux includes native Linux VXLAN kernel support.
Requirements A VXLAN configuration requires a switch with a Broadcom Tomahawk, Trident II+ or Trident II chipset running Cumulus Linux 2.0 or later, or a Mellanox Spectrum chipset running Cumulus Linux 3.2.0 or later.
For a basic VXLAN configuration, you should ensure that:
 The VXLAN has a network identifier (VNI); do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values under Cumulus Linux.</description>

      <description>In VXLAN-based networks, there are a range of complexities and challenges in determining the destination virtual tunnel endpoints (VTEPs) for any given VXLAN. At scale, various solutions, including Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV), controller-based options like Midokura MidoNet or VMware NSX and even new standards like EVPN are attempts to address these complexities, however do retain their own complexities.
Enter static VXLAN tunnels, which simply serve to connect two VTEPs in a given environment.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux 3.4 and later releases replace Quagga with FRRouting. This section outlines the upgrade process for users currently using Quagga.
These instructions only apply to upgrading to Cumulus Linux 3.4 or later from releases earlier than 3.4. New image installations contain frr instead of quagga or quagga-compat. If you are using any automation tools to configure your network and are installing a new Cumulus Linux image, make sure your automation tools refer to FRR and not to Quagga.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux seamlessly integrates with the MidoNet OpenStack infrastructure, where the switches provide the VTEP gateway for terminating VXLAN tunnels from within MidoNet. MidoNet connects to the OVSDB server running on the Cumulus Linux switch, and exchanges information about the VTEPs and MAC addresses associated with the OpenStack Neutron networks. This provides seamless Ethernet connectivity between virtual and physical server infrastructures.</description>

      <description>The network command line utility (NCLU) can quickly return a lot of information about your network configuration.
Using net show Commands Running net show and pressing TAB displays all available command line arguments usable by net. The output looks like this:
 cumulus@switch:~$ net show bgp : Border Gateway Protocol bridge : A layer2 bridge clag : Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation commit : apply the commit buffer to the system configuration : Settings, configuration state, etc counters : show netstat counters hostname : System hostname igmp : Internet Group Management Protocol interface : An interface such as swp1, swp2, etc ip : Internet Protocol version 4 ipv6 : Internet Protocol version 6 lldp : Link Layer Discovery Protocol lnv : Lightweight Network Virtualization mroute : Configure static unicast route into MRIB for multicast RPF lookup msdp : Multicast Source Discovery Protocol ospf : Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv2) ospf6 : Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv3) pim : Protocol Independent Multicast rollback : revert to a previous configuration state route : Static routes route-map : Route-map system : System information version : Version number  Showing Interfaces To show all available interfaces that are physically UP, run net show interface:</description>

      <description>sFlow is a monitoring protocol that samples network packets, application operations, and system counters. sFlow collects both interface counters and sampled 5-tuple packet information, enabling you to monitor your network traffic as well as your switch state and performance metrics. An outside server, known as an sFlow collector, is required to collect and analyze this data.
hsflowd is the daemon that samples and sends sFlow data to configured collectors. hsflowd is not included in the base Cumulus Linux installation.</description>

      <description>The cl-support script replicates the /etc directory.
Files that cl-support deliberately excludes are:
   File Description     /etc/nologin nologinprevents unprivileged users from logging into the system.   /etc/alternatives update-alternatives creates, removes, maintains and displays information about the symbolic links comprising the Debian alternatives system.    This is the alphabetical of the output from running ls -l on the /etc directory structure created by cl-support.</description>

      <description>The ethtool command enables you to query or control the network driver and hardware settings. It takes the device name (like swp1) as an argument. When the device name is the only argument to ethtool, it prints the current settings of the network device. See man ethtool(8) for details. Not all options are currently supported on switch port interfaces.
