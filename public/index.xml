      <description>Each fabric card has 2 RJ45 console ports, one for each of the CPUs. Each line card also has 2 console ports, one for each CPU that connect via a USB type A jack â€” this requires a special cable from Edgecore in order to access the line card console ports. By default, the console connects at 115200 baud 8N1.
Once connected to the line card or fabric card&amp;rsquo;s console port, you see one of the following:</description>

      <description>The NetQ API provides access to key telemetry and system monitoring data gathered about the performance and operation of your data center network and devices so that you can view that data in your internal or third-party analytic tools. The API gives you access to the health of individual switches, network protocols and services, and views of network-wide inventory and events.
This guide provides an overview of the API framework and some examples of how to use the API to extract the data you need.</description>

      <description>Cumulus VX is not a production-ready virtual switch or router. It has the same foundation as Cumulus Linux and Cumulus RMP, including all the control plane elements, but without an actual ASIC or NPU for line rate performance or hardware acceleration.
You can use tools like jdoo to monitor the virtual switch. The same automation, zero touch provisioning, security, and QoS tools are available.

      <description>This section provides an overview of configuring FRRouting (FRR), the IP routing protocol suite for Linux and Unix platforms so you can configure routing directly to your Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts or in containers.
All BFD (bidirectional forwarding detection) and PTM (Prescriptive Topology Manager) commands do not work on server hosts because PTM is not enabled on the host.
 Configuration Files At startup, FRR reads a set of files to determine the startup configuration.</description>

      <description>Each line card in the CX-10256-S/OMP-800 chassis contains 64 100G ports, broken down into 32 switch ports, which connect to an external network, and 32 fabric ports, which connect to the fabric cards. Because each line card has two Tomahawk ASICs, each line card actually is two switches. One ASIC is on the &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; side of the line card and one is on the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; side.
Each side of the line card has half of the switch ports and half of the fabric ports.</description>

      <description>Once you install the NetQÂ packages and configure the NetQ Telemetry Server, you need to configure NetQ on each node (Linux host) to monitor that node on your network.
 To ensure useful output, ensure that NTP is running.
 On the host, after you install the NetQ metapackage, restart rsyslog so logs are sent to the correct destination:
root@host:~# systemctl restart rsyslog  CentOS, RHEL or Ubuntu hosts only: Enable and restart the netqd service:</description>

      <description>NetQ provides users with the ability to go back in time to replay the network state, see fabric-wide event changelogs and root cause state deviations. The NetQ Telemetry Server maintains data collected by NetQ agents in a time-series database, making fabric-wide events available for analysis. This enables you to replay and analyze network-wide events for better visibility and to correlate patterns. This allows for root-cause analysis and optimization of network configs for the future.</description>

      <description>Cumulus VX has the same foundation as other Cumulus Networks products; that is, Cumulus Linux and Cumulus RMP. Cumulus VX includes all the control plane elements of Cumulus Linux or Cumulus RMP but does not have an actual ASIC or NPU for line rate performance or hardware acceleration. Essentially, switchd is not a part of Cumulus VX.
Thus, Cumulus VX is not a production-ready virtual switch or virtual router. It isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to run on production switches or carry production data traffic.</description>

      <description>Container Advertiser and FRRouting (FRR) work together on the host to advertise containers into the routed fabric.
Container Advertiser Architecture As Docker creates and destroys containers, the Container Advertiser listens to the docker-engine API events stream. When a container creation event is detected, a corresponding /32 host route is created in table 30 of the Linux kernel routing tables. Similarly, when a container destruction event is detected, the corresponding /32 host route is removed.</description>

      <description>The following sections describe how to configure network interfaces and FRRouting for a two-leaf/two-spine Cumulus VX network topology:
 Two spine VMs that represent two spine (aggregation layer) switches on the network.
 Two leaf VMs that represent two leaf (access layer) switches on the network.
  These instructions assume that you have installed the relevant images and hypervisors, created four VMs with appropriate names, and that the VMs are running.</description>

      <description>The NetQ Telemetry Server provides access to the NetQ Service Console, a graphical user interface (GUI) for NetQ. The service console in turn provides terminal access to any node in the fabric.
The Cumulus NetQ Service Console utilizes elements of Portainer. You can read the Portainer license file here.
 Connecting to the Service Console To connect to the service console, open a browser, and go to the IP address of the telemetry server.</description>

      <description>NetQ provides users with the ability to go back in time to replay the network state, see fabric-wide event changelogs and root cause state deviations. The NetQ Telemetry Server maintains data collected by NetQ agents in a time-series database, making fabric-wide events available for analysis. This enables you to replay and analyze network-wide events for better visibility and to correlate patterns. This allows for root-cause analysis and optimization of network configs for the future.</description>

      <description>The IPM CLI (TIPCTL) **** behaves in a similar manner to the other Cumulus CLIs . It provides help for commands and options, but it does not support TAB completion of commands  . The commands support four functional categoriesâ€“configuration, DHCP (dynamic host control protocol), network OS (operating system), and ZTP (zero-touch provisioning): 
 config: sets the network interface the service is bound to (either eth0 or eth1) and the IP address where it publishes.</description>

      <description>The default DHCP configuration uses the eth0 interface on which to listen and uses an address pool of 10.255.0.0/24. A default directory is provided for the ONIE installer script and the default ZTP script. Domain name, NTP, and web servers have assigned IP addresses. No reservations are configured. While not required, you may want to s pecify a DHCP address pool more well-suited for your environment or set up reservations for interfaces that require unchanging IP addresses.</description>

      <description>With NetQ, a network administrator can monitor both the switch hardware and software components for misconfigurations. NetQ helps answer questions such as:
 What switches do I have in the network? What hardware and software are installed on my switches? Are all switches licensed correctly? Do all switches have NetQ agents running?  NetQ uses LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) to collect port information. NetQ can also identify peer ports connected to DACs (Direct Attached Cables) and AOCs (Active Optical Cables) without using LLDP, even if the link is not UP.</description>

      <description>You can manage your zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) scripts with the NetQ Image and Provisioning Management (IPM) application. IPM uses a default ZTP script to provision and configure the basic network information needed to add them to your data center network automatically during the first boot of a switch. After that, you can have more than one script and assign each to selected switches.
To take advantage of the ZTP script management feature, you must be running Cumulus Linux 3.</description>

      <description>This topic discusses how to install a new Cumulus Linux disk image using ONIE, an open source project (equivalent to PXE on servers) that enables the installation of network operating systems (NOS) on bare metal switches.
Before you install Cumulus Linux, the switch can be in two different states:
 No image is installed on the switch (the switch is only running ONIE).
 Cumulus Linux is already installed on the switch but you want to use ONIE to reinstall Cumulus Linux or upgrade to a newer version.</description>

      <description>*Zero *touch provisioning** (ZTP) allows devices to be quickly deployed in large-scale environments. Data center engineers only need to rack and stack the switch, connect it to the management network, then install Cumulus Linux via ONIE; the initial configuration gets invoked via ZTP. Alternatively, you can insert a USB stick with the configuration so the provisioning process can start automatically.
The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed.</description>

      <description>This topic describes how to upgrade Cumulus Linux on your switches to a more recent release.
Cumulus Networks recommends that you deploy, provision, configure, and upgrade switches using automation, even with small networks or test labs. During the upgrade process, you can quickly upgrade dozens of devices in a repeatable manner. Using tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for configuration management greatly increases the speed and accuracy of the next major upgrade; these tools also enable the quick swap of failed switch hardware.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks software melds the Linux host world with the networking devices world. Each world comes with its own paradigm on how to upgrade software. Before we discuss the various ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux switches, let&amp;rsquo;s review the general considerations and strategies used to upgrade network devices and Linux hosts.
Upgrades: Comparing the Network Device Worldview vs. the Linux Host Worldview Manual vs. Automated Configuration Historically, network devices were configured in place, and most network devices required customized configurations, which led predominantly to configuring the hardware manually.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks software melds the Linux host world with the networking devices world. Each world comes with its own paradigm on how to upgrade software. Before we discuss the various ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux switches, let&amp;rsquo;s review the general considerations and strategies used to upgrade network devices and Linux hosts.
Upgrades: Comparing the Network Device Worldview vs. the Linux Host Worldview Manual vs. Automated Configuration Historically, network devices were configured in place, and most network devices required customized configurations, which led predominantly to configuring the hardware manually.</description>

      <description>Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) enables network devices to be quickly deployed in large-scale environments. Data center engineers only need to rack and stack the switch, install Cumulus Linux via ONIE, then connect the switch to the management network â€” or alternatively, insert a USB stick and boot the switch. From here, the provisioning process can start automatically and deploy a configuration.
The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed.</description>

      <description>Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) enables network devices to be quickly deployed in large-scale environments. Data center engineers only need to rack and stack the switch, connect it to the management network, then install Cumulus Linux via ONIE; the initial configuration gets invoked via ZTP. Alternatively, you can insert a USB stick with the configuration so the provisioning process can start automatically.
The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed.</description>

      <description>Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) enables network devices to be quickly deployed in large-scale environments. On first boot, Cumulus Linux will invoke ZTP, which executes the provisioning automation used to deploy the device for its intended role in the network.
The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed. You can develop this script using a variety of automation tools and scripting languages, providing ample flexibility for you to design the provisioning scheme to meet your needs.</description>

      <description>NetQ supports high availability â€” that is, the ability to continue functioning even in the absence of a single failure of the telemetry server node. To make the NetQ Telemetry Server highly available (HA mode), you need to run three instances of the telemetry server. Currently, exactly three instances are supported in HA mode. Of the three instances, one is considered the master and is writeable while the other two are read-only replicas.</description>

      <description>The NetQ Agent monitors container environments the same way it monitors physical servers. There is no special implementation. The NetQ Agent pulls data from the container as it would pull data from a Cumulus Linux switch or Linux host. It can be installed on a Linux server or in a Linux VM. NetQ Agent integrates with the Kubernetes container orchestrator.

      <description>Cumulus VX images now include the GRUB boot loader and Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) preinstalled. You can install Cumulus Linux on switch hardware using a binary image. You can test this process by installing a Cumulus VX binary image with ONIE in a virtual environment.
Installation via ONIE is supported in Cumulus VX 3.x and later versions.
 This section assumes that you have downloaded and installed a hypervisor, downloaded the Cumulus VX binary image, and configured the VM.</description>

Network Disruptions
Updating, upgrading, and installing packages with apt causes disruptions to network services:
 Upgrading a package might result in services being restarted or stopped as part of the upgrade process.
 Installing a package might disrupt core services by changing core service dependency packages. In some cases, installing new packages might also upgrade additional existing packages due to dependencies.</description>

      <description>To create a two-spine/two-leaf configuration, you start by importing the OVA image into VirtualBox four times, as each instance of the VM represents one leaf or spine switch (Cumulus VX-leaf1, Cumulus VX-leaf2, Cumulus VX-spine1 and Cumulus VX-spine2). Then you configure each VM&amp;rsquo;s network interfaces and routing settings.
Configuring the leaf1 VM Import the Cumulus VX-leaf1 VM into VirtualBox, then configure its settings.
 Double-click the OVA image file to open VirtualBox.</description>

      <description>The NetQ CLI provides access to all of the network state and event information collected by the NetQ Agents. It behaves the same way most CLIs behave, with groups of commands used to display related information, the ability to use TAB completion when entering commands, and to get help for given commands and options. The commands are grouped into four categories: check and show, agent and notifier, trace, and resolve.</description>

      <description>Another way you can add a VM to one or more of the internal virtual networks in VirtualBox is by cloning the VM. However, keep the following in mind:
 To quickly set up any configurations that you want across multiple nodes on your system, configure the settings on the original VM, then clone the VM using Machine &amp;gt; Clone.
For example, if you want to include a management VM for the new topology you are going to create, you can set the eth0 port to be on a virtual network that the management VM is on, so when you clone the new VM, it will duplicate this port, giving you an out-of-band (OOB) network.</description>

      <description>With NetQ, a network administrator can monitor virtual network components in the data center, including VXLAN, EVPN, and LNV software constructs. NetQ provides the ability to:
 Manage virtual constructs: view the performance and status of VXLANs, EVPN, and LNV
 Validate overlay communication paths
  It helps answer questions such as:
 Is my overlay configured and operating correctly?
 Is my control plane configured correctly?
 Can device A reach device B?</description>

      <description>Spanning tree protocol (STP) is always recommended in layer 2 topologies, as it prevents bridge loops and broadcast radiation on a bridged network.
mstpd is a daemon that implements IEEE802.1D 2004 and IEEE802.1Q 2011. Currently, STP is disabled by default on the bridge in Cumulus RMP.
To enable STP, configure brctl stp &amp;lt;bridge&amp;gt; on.
The STP modes Cumulus RMP supports vary depending upon which bridge driver mode is in use.</description>

      <description>You configure global HTTP and HTTPS proxies in the /etc/profile.d/ directory of Cumulus Linux. To do so, set the http_proxy variable, which tells the switch the address of the proxy server to use to fetch URLs on the command line. This is useful for programs such as apt/apt-get, curl and wget, which can all use this proxy.

      <description>In data center topologies, right cabling is a time-consuming endeavor and is error prone. Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM) is a dynamic cabling verification tool to help detect and eliminate such errors. It takes a graphviz-DOT specified network cabling plan (something many operators already generate), stored in a topology.dot file, and couples it with runtime information derived from LLDP to verify that the cabling matches the specification. The check is performed on every link transition on each node in the network.</description>

      <description>NetQ commands can also be run in an automation tool, such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet; depending on the outcome of the automation tests, the script can either continue the deployment, or roll back the changes until the issues are addressed.
Run NetQ Commands in Automation Scripts Using NetQ for preventative care of your network pairs well with automation scripts and playbooks to prevent errors on your network before deploying the configuration to your production network.</description>

      <description>Linux bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces (the slaves) into a single logical bonded interface (the bond). Cumulus RMP bonding supports the IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation mode. Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group (LAG), such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. The benefits of link aggregation are:</description>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-321/System-Configuration/Configuring-a-Global-Proxy/</guid>
      <description>You configure global HTTP and HTTPS proxies in the /etc/profile.d/ directory of Cumulus Linux. To do so, set the http_proxy and https_proxy variables, which tells the switch the address of the proxy server to use to fetch URLs on the command line. This is useful for programs such as apt/apt-get, curl and wget, which can all use this proxy.
 In a terminal, create a new file in the /etc/profile.</description>

      <description>NetQ provides the ability to codify playbooks and extend NetQ with custom commands for use cases specific to your network.
The summary of steps required to do this is a follows:
 The extensions must be written in Python or Cython.
 The commands need to be added must use network doctopt.
 The .py file (or the compiled .so if using Cython) is now copied to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/netq_apps/modules/addons.
 Enable the add-ons with the netq config add addons command</description>

      <description>Services (also known as daemons) and processes are at the heart of how a Linux system functions. Most of the time a service takes care of itself; you just enable and start it, then let it run. However, because a Cumulus Linux switch is a Linux system, you have the ability to dig deeper if you like. Services may start multiple processes as they run. Services tend to be the most important things to monitor on a Cumulus Linux switch.</description>

      <description>Spanning tree protocol (STP) is always recommended in layer 2 topologies, as it prevents bridge loops and broadcast radiation on a bridged network.
mstpd is a daemon that implements IEEE802.1D 2004 and IEEE802.1Q 2011. Currently, STP is disabled by default on the bridge in Cumulus RMP.
To enable STP, configure brctl stp &amp;lt;bridge&amp;gt; on.
The STP modes Cumulus RMP supports vary depending upon which bridge driver mode is in use.</description>

      <description>NetQ provides the ability to codify playbooks and extend NetQ with custom commands for use cases specific to your network.
The summary of steps required to do this is a follows:
 The extensions must be written in Python or Cython.
 The commands need to be added must use network doctopt.
 The .py file (or the compiled .so if using Cython) is now copied to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/netq_apps/modules/addons.
 Enable the add-ons with the netq config add addons command</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux supports Power over Ethernet (PoE) and PoE+, so certain Cumulus Linux switches can supply power from Ethernet switch ports to enabled devices over the Ethernet cables that connect them. Power over Ethernet (PoE) is capable of powering devices up to 15W, while PoE+ can power devices up to 30W.
The currently supported platform is the Edge-Core AS4610-54P, which supports PoE and PoE+ and configuration over Ethernet layer 2 LLDP for power negotiation.</description>

      <description>In data center topologies, right cabling is a time-consuming endeavor and is error prone. Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM) is a dynamic cabling verification tool to help detect and eliminate such errors. It takes a graphviz-DOT specified network cabling plan (something many operators already generate), stored in a topology.dot file, and couples it with runtime information derived from LLDP to verify that the cabling matches the specification. The check is performed on every link transition on each node in the network.</description>

      <description>Linux bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces (the slaves) into a single logical bonded interface (the bond). Cumulus RMP bonding supports the IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation mode. Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group (LAG), such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. The benefits of link aggregation are:</description>

To do so, set the http_proxy and https_proxy variables, which tells the switch the address of the proxy server to use to fetch URLs on the command line. This is useful for programs such as apt/apt-get, curl and wget, which can all use this proxy.

      <description>You can query for even more NetQ data using the SQL-like NetQ Query Language (NetQL) so you can conduct your own custom analysis or otherwise extend NetQ functionality for your specific environment without having to write your own custom code. NetQL directly queries the NetQ database for data that isn&amp;rsquo;t exposed via the check, show and trace commands.
Early Access Feature
NetQL is an early access feature in Cumulus NetQ 1.</description>

      <description>Hardware datapath configuration manages packet buffering, queueing, and scheduling in hardware. There are two configuration input files:
 /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf, which describes priority groups and assigns the scheduling algorithm and weights
 /etc/bcm.d/datapath/datapath.conf, which assigns buffer space and egress queues
  Versions of these files prior to Cumulus Linux 2.1 are incompatible with Cumulus Linux 2.1 and later; using older files will cause switchd to fail to start and return an error that it cannot find the /var/lib/cumulus/rc.</description>

      <description>The NetQ Agent collects interface counters from /proc/net/dev and pushes them to the NetQ Telemetry Server, where they are stored in a container running an InfluxDB database. Only counters for physical interfaces are collected; NetQ does not collect counters for non-physical interfaces like bonds, bridges and VXLANs.
The NetQ Agent uses the netq-stats-pushd service to collect counters and push them to the database on the telemetry server. The service collects counters every 15 seconds.</description>

      <description>Hardware datapath configuration manages packet buffering, queueing, and scheduling in hardware. There are two configuration input files:
 /etc/cumulus/datapath/traffic.conf, which describes priority groups and assigns the scheduling algorithm and weights
 /etc/bcm.d/datapath/datapath.conf, which assigns buffer space and egress queues
  Versions of these files prior to Cumulus Linux 2.1 are incompatible with Cumulus Linux 2.1 and later; using older files will cause switchd to fail to start and return an error that it cannot find the /var/lib/cumulus/rc.</description>

      <description>You can use cl-resource-queryto retrieve information about host entries, MAC entries, L2 and L3 routes, and ingress and degrees ACL counters and entries that are in use. This is especially useful because Cumulus RMP syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.
In order to avoid this, routes in the hardware should be monitored and kept below the ASIC limits.</description>

      <description>Spanning tree protocol (STP) is always recommended in layer 2 topologies, as it prevents bridge loops and broadcast radiation on a bridged network.
mstpd is a daemon that implements IEEE802.1D 2004 and IEEE802.1Q 2018. Currently, STP is disabled by default on the bridge in Cumulus Linux.
To enable STP, configure brctl stp &amp;lt;bridge&amp;gt; on.
The STP modes Cumulus Linux supports vary depending upon which bridge driver mode is in use.</description>

      <description>While regular maintenance of NetQ is not required, there are some tasks that you may want to perform in the course of everyday operations. As the network changes, you might have the need to add or remove monitored nodes, notification integrations, and NetQ Agents for example. You might also need to restore NetQ to a prior version or upgrade to a new version.
Manage the Telemetry Server Because the Telemetry Server (TS) contains the configurations for event notification integrations and NetQ Notifier filters, you might need to modify these configurations at some point in the life cycle of your deployment.</description>

      <description>sFlow is a monitoring protocol that samples network packets, application operations, and system counters. sFlow enables you to monitor your network traffic as well as your switch state and performance metrics. An outside server, known as an sFlow collector, is required to collect and analyze this data.
hsflowd is the daemon that samples and sends sFlow data to configured collectors. hsflowd is not included in the base Cumulus RMP installation.</description>

Example NetQ Switch Configuration File The following sample netq.yml file is located in /etc/netq/ on the NetQ Telemetry Server. Note that netq.yml looks different on a switch or host monitored by NetQ; for example, the backend server IP address and port would be uncommented and listed .
Editing /etc/netq/config.d to configure NetQ Notifier or putting other YML files in the /etc/netq directory overrides the configuration in /etc/netq/netq.</description>

      <description>In data center topologies, right cabling is a time-consuming endeavor and is error prone. Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM) is a dynamic cabling verification tool to help detect and eliminate such errors. It takes a graphviz-DOT specified network cabling plan (something many operators already generate), stored in a topology.dot file, and couples it with runtime information derived from LLDP to verify that the cabling matches the specification. The check is performed on every link transition on each node in the network.</description>

      <description>The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides a method of authenticating a client (called a supplicant) over wired media. It also provides access for individual MAC addresses on a switch (called the authenticator) once those MAC addresses have been authenticated by an authentication server â€” typically a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service, defined by RFC 2865) server.
A Cumulus Linux switch acts as an intermediary between the clients connected to the wired ports and the authentication server, which is reachable over the existing network.</description>

      <description>Linux bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces (the slaves) into a single logical bonded interface (the bond). Cumulus Linux bonding supports the IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation mode. Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group (LAG), such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link.

It also provides access for individual MAC addresses on a switch (called the authenticator) once those MAC addresses have been authenticated by an authentication server â€” typically a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service, defined by RFC 2865) server.
A Cumulus Linux switch acts as an intermediary between the clients connected to the wired ports and the authentication server, which is reachable over the existing network.</description>

      <description>Facebook Voyager is a Broadcom Tomahawk-based switch with added Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) ports that can connect to another switch thousands of kilometers away by adding transponders. DWDM allows many separate connections on one fiber pair by sending them over different wavelengths. Although the wavelengths are sent on the same physical fiber, they do not interact with each other, similar to VLANs on a trunk. Each wavelength can transport very high speeds over very long distances.</description>

Enabling Logging for Networking The /etc/default/networking file contains two settings for logging:
 To get ifupdown2 logs when the switch boots (stored in syslog)
 To enable logging when you run service networking [start|stop|reload]
  This file also contains an option for excluding interfaces when you boot the switch or run service networking start|stop|reload. You can exclude any interface specified in /etc/network/interfaces.</description>

      <description>In data center topologies, right cabling is a time-consuming endeavor and is error prone. Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM) is a dynamic cabling verification tool to help detect and eliminate such errors. It takes a Graphviz-DOT specified network cabling plan (something many operators already generate), stored in a topology.dot file, and couples it with runtime information derived from LLDP to verify that the cabling matches the specification. The check is performed on every link transition on each node in the network.</description>

      <description>On Cumulus Linux, LACP Bypass is a feature that allows a bond configured in 802.3ad mode to become active and forward traffic even when there is no LACP partner. A typical use case for this feature is to enable a host, without the capability to run LACP, to PXE boot while connected to a switch on a bond configured in 802.3ad mode. Once the pre-boot process finishes and the host is capable of running LACP, the normal 802.</description>

      <description>You can use cl-resource-queryto retrieve information about host entries, MAC entries, L2 and L3 routes, and ingress and degrees ACL counters and entries that are in use. This is especially useful because Cumulus RMP syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.
In order to avoid this, routes in the hardware should be monitored and kept below the ASIC limits.</description>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-rmp-321/Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/Resource-Diagnostics-Using-cl-resource-query/</guid>
      <description>You can use cl-resource-query to retrieve information about host entries, MAC entries, L2 and L3 routes, and ingress and degrees ACL counters and entries that are in use. This is especially useful because Cumulus RMP syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.</description>

      <description>VRR provides virtualized router redundancy in network configurations, which enables the hosts to communicate with any redundant router without:
 Needing to be reconfigured
 Having to run dynamic router protocols
 Having to run router redundancy protocols
  A basic VRR-enabled network configuration is shown below. The network consists of several hosts, two routers running Cumulus Linux and configured with MLAG, and the rest of the network:</description>

      <description>Linux bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces (slaves) into a single logical bonded interface (bond). The only bonding mode supported in Cumulus Linux is the IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation mode, which allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group (LAG), such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link.</description>

      <description>NetQ provides the ability to codify playbooks and extend NetQ with custom commands for use cases specific to your network.
The summary of steps required to do this is a follows:
 The extensions must be written in Python or Cython.
 The commands need to be added must use network doctopt.
 The .py file (or the compiled .so if using Cython) is now copied to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/netq_apps/modules/addons.

      <description>Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation, or MLAG, enables a server or switch with a two-port bond (such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel, port group, or trunk) to connect those ports to different switches and operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput.
Dual-connected devices can create LACP bonds that contain links to each physical switch. Thus, active-active links from the dual-connected devices are supported even though they are connected to two different physical switches.</description>

      <description>IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) snooping functionality is implemented in the bridge driver in the kernel. IGMP snooping processes IGMP v1/v2/v3 reports received on a bridge port in a bridge to identify the hosts which would like to receive multicast traffic destined to that group.
When an IGMPv2 leave message is received, a group specific query is sent to identify if there are any other hosts interested in that group, before the group is deleted.</description>

      <description>On Cumulus Linux, LACP Bypass is a feature that allows a bond configured in 802.3ad mode to become active and forward traffic even when there is no LACP partner. A typical use case for this feature is to enable a host, without the capability to run LACP, to PXE boot while connected to a switch on a bond configured in 802.3ad mode. Once the pre-boot process finishes and the host is capable of running LACP, the normal 802.</description>

NetQ can monitor many aspects of an MLAG configuration, including:
 Verifying the current state of all nodes Verifying the dual connectivity state Checking that the peer link is part of the bridge Verifying whether MLAG bonds are not bridge members Verifying whether the VXLAN interface is not a bridge member Checking for remote-side service failures caused by systemctl Checking for VLAN-VNI mapping mismatches Checking for layer 3 MTU mismatches on peerlink subinterfaces Checking for VXLAN active-active address inconsistencies Verifying that STP priorities are the same across both peers  Scenario: All Nodes Are Up When the MLAG configuration is running smoothly, NetQ sends out a message that all nodes are up:</description>

      <description>Switches collect statistics about the performance of their interfaces. The NetQ Agent on each switch collects these statistics every 15 seconds by reading /proc/net/dev, and then sending them to the NetQ Telemetry Server where it is stored in its InfluxDB in procnetdev. The Telemetry Server netq-stats-pushd service manages the receipt and storage of the statistics.
Only statistics for physical interfaces are collected; NetQ does not collect statistics for non-physical interfaces, such as bonds, bridges, and VXLANs.</description>

By default, lldpd runs as a daemon and is started at system boot. lldpd command line arguments are placed in /etc/default/lldpd. lldpd configuration options are placed in /etc/lldpd.conf or under /etc/lldpd.d/.
For more details on the command line arguments and config options, please see man lldpd(8).</description>

      <description>Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation, or MLAG, enables a server or switch with a two-port bond (such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel, port group or trunk) to connect those ports to different switches and operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput.
MLAG or CLAG?
The Cumulus Linux implementation of MLAG is referred to by other vendors as CLAG, MC-LAG or VPC.</description>

      <description>Spanning tree protocol (STP) is always recommended in layer 2 topologies, as it prevents bridge loops and broadcast radiation on a bridged network. STP also provides redundant links for automatic failover when an active link fails. STP is disabled by default on bridges in Cumulus Linux.
Supported Modes The STP modes Cumulus Linux supports vary depending upon whether the traditional or VLAN-aware bridge driver mode is in use.</description>

      <description>On Cumulus Linux, LACP Bypass is a feature that allows a bond configured in 802.3ad mode to become active and forward traffic even when there is no LACP partner. A typical use case for this feature is to enable a host, without the capability to run LACP, to PXE boot while connected to a switch on a bond configured in 802.3ad mode. Once the pre-boot process finishes and the host is capable of running LACP, the normal 802.</description>

      <description>In data center topologies, right cabling is a time-consuming endeavor and is error prone. Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM) is a dynamic cabling verification tool to help detect and eliminate such errors. It takes a Graphviz-DOT specified network cabling plan (something many operators already generate), stored in a topology.dot file, and couples it with runtime information derived from LLDP to verify that the cabling matches the specification. The check is performed on every link transition on each node in the network.</description>

      <description>Cumulus RMP uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) and Name Service Switch (NSS) for user authentication.
NSS specifies the order of information sources used to resolve names for each service. Using this with authentication and authorization, it provides the order and location used for user lookup and group mapping on the system. PAM handles the interaction between the user and the system, providing login handling, session setup, authentication of users and authorization of a user actions.</description>

      <description>Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation, or MLAG, enables a server or switch with a two-port bond (such as a link aggregation group/LAG, EtherChannel, port group or trunk) to connect those ports to different switches and operate as if they are connected to a single, logical switch. This provides greater redundancy and greater system throughput.

Commands  ip route  Static Routing via ip route The ip route command allows manipulating the kernel routing table directly from the Linux shell. See man ip(8) for details. quagga monitors the kernel routing table changes and updates its own routing table accordingly.
To display the routing table:
cumulus@switch:~$ ip route show default via 10.0.1.2 dev eth0 10.0.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses the various routing protocols, and how to configure them.
Defining Routing Protocols A routing protocol dynamically computes reachability between various end points. This enables communication to work around link and node failures, and additions and withdrawals of various addresses.
IP routing protocols are typically distributed; that is, an instance of the routing protocol runs on each of the routers in a network.
Cumulus Linux does not support running multiple instances of the same protocol on a router.</description>

      <description>NetQ provides users with the ability to go back in time to replay the network state, see fabric-wide event change logs and root cause state deviations. The NetQ Telemetry Server maintains data collected by NetQ agents in a time-series database, making fabric-wide events available for analysis. This enables you to replay and analyze network-wide events for better visibility and to correlate patterns. This allows for root-cause analysis and optimization of network configs for the future.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux uses quagga, an open source routing software suite, to provide the routing protocols for dynamic routing. Cumulus Linux supports the l atest Quagga version, 0.99.23.1. Quagga is a fork of the GNU Zebra project.
Quagga provides many routing protocols, of which Cumulus Linux supports the following:
 Open Shortest Path First ( v2 and v3 )
 Border Gateway Protocol
  Architecture As shown in the figure above, the Quagga routing suite consists of various protocol-specific daemons and a protocol-independent daemon called zebra.</description>

      <description>This topic outlines a few scenarios that illustrate how you use NetQ to troubleshoot MLAG on Cumulus Linux switches. Each starts with a log message that indicates the current MLAG state.
NetQ can monitor many aspects of an MLAG configuration, including:
 Verifying the current state of all nodes
 Verifying the dual connectivity state
 Checking that the peer link is part of the bridge
 Verifying whether MLAG bonds are not bridge members</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux provides the option of using Virtual Router Redundancy (VRR) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).
VRR enables hosts to communicate with any redundant router without reconfiguration, running dynamic router protocols, or running router redundancy protocols. This means that redundant routers respond to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests from hosts. Routers are configured to respond in an identical manner, but if one fails, the other redundant routers continue to respond, leaving the hosts with the impression that nothing has changed.</description>

      <description>OSPFv2 is a link-state routing protocol for IPv4. OSPF maintains the view of the network topology conceptually as a directed graph. Each router represents a vertex in the graph. Each link between neighboring routers represents a unidirectional edge. Each link has an associated weight (called cost) that is either automatically derived from its bandwidth or administratively assigned. Using the weighted topology graph, each router computes a shortest path tree (SPT) with itself as the root, and applies the results to build its forwarding table.</description>

      <description>Cumulus RMP uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) and Name Service Switch (NSS) for user authentication.
NSS specifies the order of information sources used to resolve names for each service. Using this with authentication and authorization, it provides the order and location used for user lookup and group mapping on the system. PAM handles the interaction between the user and the system, providing login handling, session setup, authentication of users and authorization of a user actions.</description>

      <description>In computer networks, topology refers to the structure of interconnecting various nodes. Some commonly used topologies in networks are star, hub and spoke, leaf and spine, and broadcast.
Clos Topologies In the vast majority of modern data centers, Clos or fat tree topology is very popular. This topology is shown in the figure below. It is also commonly referred to as leaf-spine topology. We shall use this topology throughout the routing protocol guide.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux includes native Linux VXLAN kernel support.
Requirements A VXLAN configuration requires a switch with a Broadcom Tomahawk, Trident II+ or Trident II chipset running Cumulus Linux 2.0 or later, or a Mellanox Spectrum chipset running Cumulus Linux 3.2.0 or later.
For a basic VXLAN configuration, you should ensure that:
 The VXLAN has a network identifier (VNI); do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values under Cumulus Linux.</description>

      <description>*Zero *touch provisioning** allows devices to be quickly deployed in large-scale environments. Data center engineers only need to rack and stack the switch, connect it to the management network, then install Cumulus RMP via ONIE; the initial configuration gets invoked via ZTP. Alternatively, you can insert a USB stick with the configuration so the provisioning process can start automatically.
The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

      <description>OSPFv2 is a link-state routing protocol for IPv4. OSPF maintains the view of the network topology conceptually as a directed graph. Each router represents a vertex in the graph. Each link between neighboring routers represents a unidirectional edge. Each link has an associated weight (called cost) that is either automatically derived from its bandwidth or administratively assigned. Using the weighted topology graph, each router computes a shortest path tree (SPT) with itself as the root, and applies the results to build its forwarding table.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux supports hardware-based equal cost multipath (ECMP) load sharing. ECMP is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux. Load sharing occurs automatically for all routes with multiple next hops installed. ECMP load sharing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.
ECMP is not supported in Cumulus RMP.
 Understanding Equal Cost Routing ECMP operates only on equal cost routes in the Linux routing table.
In this example, the 10.1.1.0/24 route has two possible next hops that have been installed in the routing table:</description>

      <description>This chapter covers configuring VXLAN gateways using a loopback cable (which we call a hyperloop) on non-RIOT (VXLAN routing) capable ASICs running Cumulus Linux.
The Broadcom Trident II and Tomahawk ASICs have a limitation where a L2 bridge that contains a VXLAN interface can not also have an IP address assigned to it. This is an expected limitation with this ASIC, because of the ordering of the decapsulation. A packet that is decapsulated will already have passed the portion of the ASIC capable of reading the IP address lookup (for example, VXLAN lookup happens before IP address lookup).</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux seamlessly integrates with the MidoNet OpenStack infrastructure, where the switches provide the VTEP gateway for terminating VXLAN tunnels from within MidoNet. MidoNet connects to the OVSDB server running on the Cumulus Linux switch, and exchanges information about the VTEPs and MAC addresses associated with the OpenStack Neutron networks. This provides seamless Ethernet connectivity between virtual and physical server infrastructures.
Getting Started Before you create VXLANs with MidoNet, make sure you have the following components:</description>

      <description>Management VRF (multiple routing tables and forwarding) provides routing separation between the out-of-band management network and the in-band data plane network. When management VRF is enabled, applications running on control plane processor communicate out from the management network unless configured otherwise.
Management VRF creates two routing tables within the Linux kernel:
 main: This is the routing table for all the data plane switch ports.
 mgmt: This is the routing table for eth0.</description>

      <description>OSPFv3 is a revised version of OSPFv2 to support the IPv6 address family. Refer to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol for a discussion on the basic concepts, which remain the same between the two versions.
OSPFv3 has changed the formatting in some of the packets and LSAs either as a necessity to support IPv6 or to improve the protocol behavior based on OSPFv2 experience. Most notably, v3 defines a new LSA, called intra-area prefix LSA to separate out the advertisement of stub networks attached to a router from the router LSA.</description>

      <description>In VXLAN-based networks, there are a range of complexities and challenges in determining the destination virtual tunnel endpoints (VTEPs) for any given VXLAN. At scale, various solutions, including Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV), controller-based options like Midokura MidoNet or VMware NSX and even new standards like EVPN are attempts to address these complexities, however do retain their own complexities.
Enter static VXLAN tunnels, which simply serve to connect two VTEPs in a given environment.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

      <description>BGP is the routing protocol that runs the Internet. It is an increasingly popular protocol for use in the data center as it lends itself well to the rich interconnections in a Clos topology. Specifically:
 It does not require routing state to be periodically refreshed unlike OSPF.
 It is less chatty than its link-state siblings. For example, a link or node transition can result in a bestpath change, causing BGP to send updates.</description>

The initial definition of VXLAN (RFC 7348) did not include any control plane and relied on a flood-and-learn approach for MAC address learning. An alternate deployment model was to use a controller or a technology such as Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV) in Cumulus Linux.</description>

      <description>VXLAN routing, sometimes referred to as inter-VXLAN routing, provides IP routing between VXLAN VNIs in overlay networks. The routing of traffic is based on the inner header or the overlay tenant IP address.
Because VXLAN routing is fundamentally routing, it is most commonly deployed with a control plane, such as Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN). You can set up static routing too, either with or without the Cumulus Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV) for MAC distribution and BUM handling.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux supports hardware-based equal cost multipath (ECMP) load sharing. ECMP is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux. Load sharing occurs automatically for all routes with multiple next hops installed. ECMP load sharing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.
Understanding Equal Cost Routing ECMP operates only on equal cost routes in the Linux routing table.
In this example, the 10.1.1.0/24 route has two possible next hops that have been installed in the routing table:</description>

      <description>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) provides a control plane for VXLANs in Cumulus Linux, with the following functionality:
 VNI membership exchange between VTEPs using EVPN type-3 (Inclusive multicast Ethernet tag) routes.
 Exchange of host MAC and IP addresses using EVPN type-2 (MAC/IP advertisement) routes.
 Support for host/VM mobility (MAC and IP moves) through exchange of the MAC Mobility Extended community.
 Support for dual-attached hosts via VXLAN active-active mode; note that MAC synchronization between the peer switches is done using MLAG.</description>

      <description>The Cumulus RMP operating system resides on a switch as a disk image. This section discusses how to manage them.
Cumulus RMP comes preinstalled on your switch. However there may be instances where you need to perform a full image installation. Before you install Cumulus RMP, the switch can be in two different states:
 The switch already has Cumulus RMP installed on it, so you only need to upgrade it.</description>

      <description>Redistribute neighbor provides a mechanism for IP subnets to span racks without forcing the end hosts to run a routing protocol.
The fundamental premise behind redistribute neighbor is to announce individual host /32 routes in the routed fabric. Other hosts on the fabric can then use this new path to access the hosts in the fabric. If multiple equal-cost paths (ECMP) are available, traffic can load balance across the available paths natively.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux includes native Linux VXLAN kernel support.
Requirements A VXLAN configuration requires a switch with a Broadcom Tomahawk, Trident II+ or Trident II chipset running Cumulus Linux 2.0 or later, or a Mellanox Spectrum chipset running Cumulus Linux 3.2.0 or later.
For a basic VXLAN configuration, you should ensure that:
 The VXLAN has a network identifier (VNI); do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values under Cumulus Linux.</description>

      <description>This chapter covers configuring VXLAN gateways using a loopback cable (which we call a hyperloop) on non-RIOT (VXLAN routing) capable ASICs running Cumulus Linux.
The Broadcom Trident II and Tomahawk ASICs have a limitation where a layer 2 bridge that contains a VXLAN interface can not also have an IP address assigned to it. This is an expected limitation with this ASIC, because of the ordering of the decapsulation. A packet that is decapsulated will already have passed the portion of the ASIC capable of reading the IP address lookup (for example, VXLAN lookup happens before IP address lookup).</description>

      <description>VXLAN routing, sometimes referred to as inter-VXLAN routing, provides IP routing between VXLAN VNIs in overlay networks. The routing of traffic is based on the inner header or the overlay tenant IP address.
Because VXLAN routing is fundamentally routing, it is most commonly deployed with a control plane, such as Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN). You can set up static routing too, either with or without the Cumulus Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV) for MAC distribution and BUM handling.</description>

      <description>The Cumulus RMP bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

Data center engineers only need to rack and stack the switch, then connect it to the management network â€” or alternatively, insert a USB stick and boot the switch. From here, the provisioning process can start automatically and deploy a configuration.
The provisioning framework allows for a one-time, user-provided script to be executed. This script can be used to add the switch to a configuration management (CM) platform such as Puppet, Chef, CFEngine, or even a custom, home-grown tool.</description>

      <description>QinQ is an amendment to the IEEE 802.1Q specification that provides the capability for multiple VLAN tags to be inserted into a single Ethernet frame.
The primary use case for QinQ with VXLAN is where a service provider who offers multi-tenant layer 2 connectivity between different customersâ€™ data centers (private clouds) may also need to connect those data centers to public cloud providers. Public clouds often has a mandatory QinQ handoff interface, where the outer tag is for the customer and the inner tag is for the service.</description>

      <description>Management VRF â€” a subset of VRF (virtual routing tables and forwarding) â€” provides a separation between the out-of-band management network and the in-band data plane network. For all VRFs, the main routing table is the default table for all of the data plane switch ports. With management VRF, a second table, mgmt, is used for routing through eth0.
Cumulus Linux only supports eth0 as the management interface. VLAN subinterfaces, bonds, bridges and the front panel switch ports are not supported as management interfaces.</description>

This is an expected limitation with this ASIC, because of the ordering of the decapsulation. A packet that is decapsulated will already have passed the portion of the ASIC capable of reading the IP address lookup (for example, VXLAN lookup happens before IP address lookup).</description>

      <description>VXLAN routing, sometimes referred to as inter-VXLAN routing, provides IP routing between VXLAN VNIs in overlay networks. The routing of traffic is based on the inner header or the overlay tenant IP address.
VXLAN routing is supported on the following platforms:
 Broadcom Tomahawk using an internal loopback on one or more switch ports
 Broadcom Trident II+ using a RIOT profile
 Mellanox Spectrum
  If you want to use VXLAN routing on a Trident II switch, you must use a hyperloop.</description>

      <description>On Broadcom Trident II and Tomahawk switches running Cumulus Linux, there is a limit to the number of VXLANs you can configure simultaneously. The limit most often given is 2000 VXLANs, but you might want to get more specific and know exactly the limit for your specific design.
While this limitation does apply to Trident II+, Trident3, or Maverick ASICs, Cumulus Linux supports the same number of VXLANs on these ASICs as it does for Trident II or Tomahawk ASICs.</description>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-31/Layer-3-Features/Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF/</guid>
      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

      <description>QinQ is an amendment to the IEEE 802.1Q specification that provides the capability for multiple VLAN tags to be inserted into a single Ethernet frame.
The primary use case for QinQ with VXLAN is where a service provider who offers multi-tenant layer 2 connectivity between different customersâ€™ data centers (private clouds) may also need to connect those data centers to public cloud providers. Public clouds often has a mandatory QinQ handoff interface, where the outer tag is for the customer and the inner tag is for the service.</description>

      <description>Management VRF â€” a subset of VRF (virtual routing tables and forwarding) â€” provides a separation between the out-of-band management network and the in-band data plane network. For all VRFs, the main routing table is the default table for all of the data plane switch ports. With management VRF, a second table, mgmt, is used for routing through eth0.
Cumulus Linux only supports eth0 as the management interface. VLAN subinterfaces, bonds, bridges and the front panel switch ports are not supported as management interfaces.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses routing on switches running Cumulus Linux.
Managing Static Routes You manage static routes using NCLU or the Cumulus Linux ip route command. The routes are added to the Quagga routing table, and are then updated into the kernel routing table as well.
To add a static route, run:
cumulus@switch:~$ net add routing route 203.0.113.0/24 198.51.100.2 cumulus@switch:~$ net pending cumulus@switch:~$ net commit  These commands create the following configuration in the /etc/quagga/Quagga.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses the various routing protocols, and how to configure them.
Defining Routing Protocols A routing protocol dynamically computes reachability between various end points. This enables communication to work around link and node failures, and additions and withdrawals of various addresses.
IP routing protocols are typically distributed; that is, an instance of the routing protocol runs on each of the routers in a network.
Cumulus Linux does not support running multiple instances of the same protocol on a router.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux uses Cumulus Quagga, a fork of the open source routing software suite, to provide the routing protocols for dynamic routing. Cumulus Quagga runs the latest Quagga version, 0.99.23.1+cl3u2. Quagga is a fork of the GNU Zebra project.
Quagga provides many routing protocols, of which Cumulus Linux supports the following:
 Open Shortest Path First (v2 and v3)
 Border Gateway Protocol
  Architecture As shown in the figure above, the Quagga routing suite consists of various protocol-specific daemons and a protocol-independent daemon called zebra.</description>

      <description>You can use cl-resource-query to retrieve information about host entries, MAC entries, L2 and L3 routes, and ECMPs (equal-cost multi-path routes, see Load Balancing) that are in use. This is especially useful because Cumulus Linux syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.</description>

      <description>You monitor system hardware in these ways, using:
 decode-syseeprom
 sensors
 smond
 Net-SNMP
 watchdog
  Commands  decode-syseeprom
 dmidecode
 lshw
 sensors
 smond
  Monitoring Hardware Using decode-syseeprom The decode-syseeprom command enables you to retrieve information about the switch&amp;rsquo;s EEPROM. If the EEPROM is writable, you can set values on the EEPROM.
For example:
cumulus@switch:~$ decode-syseeprom TlvInfo Header: Id String: TlvInfo Version: 1 Total Length: 114 TLV Name Code Len Value -------------------- ---- --- ----- Product Name 0x21 4 4804 Part Number 0x22 14 R0596-F0009-00 Device Version 0x26 1 2 Serial Number 0x23 19 D1012023918PE000012 Manufacture Date 0x25 19 10/09/2013 20:39:02 Base MAC Address 0x24 6 00:E0:EC:25:7B:D0 MAC Addresses 0x2A 2 53 Vendor Name 0x2D 17 Penguin Computing Label Revision 0x27 4 4804 Manufacture Country 0x2C 2 CN CRC-32 0xFE 4 0x96543BC5 (checksum valid)  Command Options Usage: /usr/cumulus/bin/decode-syseeprom [-a][-r][-s [args]][-t]</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses routing on switches running Cumulus Linux.
Managing Static Routes You manage static routes using NCLU or the Cumulus Linux ip route command. The routes are added to the Quagga routing table, and are then updated into the kernel routing table as well.
To add a static route, run:
cumulus@switch:~$ net add routing route 203.0.113.0/24 198.51.100.2 cumulus@switch:~$ net pending cumulus@switch:~$ net commit  These commands create the following configuration in the /etc/quagga/Quagga.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses the various routing protocols, and how to configure them.
Defining Routing Protocols A routing protocol dynamically computes reachability between various end points. This enables communication to work around link and node failures, and additions and withdrawals of various addresses.
IP routing protocols are typically distributed; that is, an instance of the routing protocol runs on each of the routers in a network.
Cumulus Linux does not support running multiple instances of the same protocol on a router.</description>

      <description>sFlow is a monitoring protocol that samples network packets, application operations, and system counters. sFlow enables you to monitor your network traffic as well as your switch state and performance metrics. An outside server, known as an sFlow collector, is required to collect and analyze this data.
hsflowd is the daemon that samples and sends sFlow data to configured collectors. hsflowd is not included in the base Cumulus Linux installation.</description>

      <description>OSPFv2 is a link-state routing protocol for IPv4. OSPF maintains the view of the network topology conceptually as a directed graph. Each router represents a vertex in the graph. Each link between neighboring routers represents a unidirectional edge. Each link has an associated weight (called cost) that is either automatically derived from its bandwidth or administratively assigned. Using the weighted topology graph, each router computes a shortest path tree (SPT) with itself as the root, and applies the results to build its forwarding table.</description>

      <description>The Cumulus RMP bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>OSPFv3 is a revised version of OSPFv2 to support the IPv6 address family. Refer to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol for a discussion on the basic concepts, which remain the same between the two versions.
OSPFv3 has changed the formatting in some of the packets and LSAs either as a necessity to support IPv6 or to improve the protocol behavior based on OSPFv2 experience. Most notably, v3 defines a new LSA, called intra-area prefix LSA to separate out the advertisement of stub networks attached to a router from the router LSA.</description>

      <description>You can use cl-resource-queryto retrieve information about host entries, MAC entries, L2 and L3 routes, and ECMPs (equal-cost multi-path routes, see Load Balancing) that are in use. This is especially useful because Cumulus Linux syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.
In order to avoid this, routes in the hardware should be monitored and kept below the ASIC limits.</description>

      <description>The Cumulus RMP bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>BGP is the routing protocol that runs the Internet. It is an increasingly popular protocol for use in the data center as it lends itself well to the rich interconnections in a Clos topology. Specifically:
 It does not require routing state to be periodically refreshed unlike OSPF.
 It is less chatty than its link-state siblings. For example, a link or node transition can result in a bestpath change, causing BGP to send updates.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux uses Cumulus Quagga, a fork of the open source routing software suite, to provide the routing protocols for dynamic routing. Cumulus Quagga runs the latest Quagga version, 0.99.23.1+cl3u2. Quagga is a fork of the GNU Zebra project.
Quagga provides many routing protocols, of which Cumulus Linux supports the following:
 Open Shortest Path First (v2 and v3)
 Border Gateway Protocol
  Architecture As shown in the figure above, the Quagga routing suite consists of various protocol-specific daemons and a protocol-independent daemon called zebra.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses routing on switches running Cumulus Linux.
Managing Static Routes You manage static routes using NCLU or the Cumulus Linux ip route command. The routes are added to the FRRouting routing table, and are then updated into the kernel routing table as well.
To add a static route, run:
cumulus@switch:~$ net add routing route 203.0.113.0/24 198.51.100.2 cumulus@switch:~$ net pending cumulus@switch:~$ net commit  These commands create the following configuration in the /etc/frr/frr.</description>

Enabling Logging for Networking The /etc/default/networking file contains two settings for logging:
 To get ifupdown2 logs when the switch boots (stored in syslog)
 To enable logging when you run service networking [start|stop|reload]
  This file also contains an option for excluding interfaces when you boot the switch or run service networking start|stop|reload. You can exclude any interface specified in /etc/network/interfaces.</description>

      <description>This chapter discusses the various routing protocols, and how to configure them.
Defining Routing Protocols A routing protocol dynamically computes reachability between various end points. This enables communication to work around link and node failures, and additions and withdrawals of various addresses.
IP routing protocols are typically distributed; that is, an instance of the routing protocol runs on each of the routers in a network.
Cumulus Linux does not support running multiple instances of the same protocol on a router.</description>

You can retrieve the data from these counters using tools like ip -s link show, ifconfig, /proc/net/dev, or netstat -i.
Sample VXLAN Statistics VXLAN statistics are available as follows:
 Aggregate statistics are available per VNI; this includes access and network statistics.</description>

OSPFv3 has changed the formatting in some of the packets and LSAs either as a necessity to support IPv6 or to improve the protocol behavior based on OSPFv2 experience. Most notably, v3 defines a new LSA, called intra-area prefix LSA to separate out the advertisement of stub networks attached to a router from the router LSA.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux uses Cumulus Quagga, a fork of the open source routing software suite, to provide the routing protocols for dynamic routing. Cumulus Quagga runs the latest Quagga version, 0.99.23.1+cl3u2. Quagga is a fork of the GNU Zebra project.
Quagga provides many routing protocols, of which Cumulus Linux supports the following:
 Open Shortest Path First (v2 and v3)
 Border Gateway Protocol
  Architecture As shown in the figure above, the Quagga routing suite consists of various protocol-specific daemons and a protocol-independent daemon called zebra.</description>

      <description>Redistribute neighbor provides a mechanism for IP subnets to span racks without forcing the end hosts to run a routing protocol.
The fundamental premise behind redistribute neighbor is to announce individual host /32 routes in the routed fabric. Other hosts on the fabric can then use this new path to access the hosts in the fabric. If multiple equal-cost paths (ECMP) are available, traffic can load balance across the available paths natively.</description>

Cumulus Linux does not prevent customers from extending SNMP features. However, Cumulus Networks encourages the use of higher performance monitoring environments, rather than SNMP.
 Starting the SNMP Daemon snmpd is disabled by default in Cumulus Linux 2.5.x. The following procedure is the recommended process to start snmpd, and monitor it using jdoo.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

For all VRFs, the main routing table is the default table for all of the data plane switch ports. With management VRF, a second table, mgmt, is used for routing through the switch&amp;rsquo;s Ethernet ports. The mgmt name is special cased to identify the management VRF from a data plane VRF.</description>

      <description>Address Resolution Protocol (  ARP ) is a  communication protocol used for discovering the  link layer address, such as a  MAC address , associated with a given  network layer address  . ARP is defined by  RFC 826. The  Cumulus Linux ARP implementation differs from standard Debian Linux ARP behavior in a few ways because Cumulus Linux is an operating system for routers/switches rather than servers.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

      <description>Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a multicast control plane protocol, that advertises multicast sources and receivers over a routed layer 3 network. Layer 3 multicast relies on PIM to advertise information about multicast capable routers and the location of multicast senders and receivers. For this reason, multicast cannot be sent through a routed network without PIM.
PIM has two modes of operation: Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Dense Mode (PIM-DM).</description>

Each link between neighboring routers represents a unidirectional edge and each link has an associated weight (called cost) that is either automatically derived from its bandwidth or administratively assigned. Using the weighted topology graph, each router computes a shortest path tree (SPT) with itself as the root, and applies the results to build its forwarding table.</description>

      <description>Typical routing systems and protocols forward traffic based on the destination address in the packet, which is used to look up an entry in a routing table. However, sometimes the traffic on your network requires a more hands-on approach. You might need to forward a packet based on the source address, the packet size, or other information in the packet header.
Policy-based routing (PBR) lets you make routing decisions based on filters that change the routing behavior of specific traffic so that you can override the routing table and influence where the traffic goes.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux supports hardware-based equal cost multipath (ECMP) load sharing. ECMP is enabled by default in Cumulus Linux. Load sharing occurs automatically for all routes with multiple next hops installed. ECMP load sharing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.
Understanding Equal Cost Routing ECMP operates only on equal cost routes in the Linux routing table.
In this example, the 10.1.1.0/24 route has two possible next hops that have been installed in the routing table:</description>

      <description>Management VRF â€” a subset of VRF (virtual routing tables and forwarding) â€” provides a separation between the out-of-band management network and the in-band data plane network. For all VRFs, the main routing table is the default table for all of the data plane switch ports. With management VRF, a second table, mgmt, is used for routing through the switch&amp;rsquo;s Ethernet ports.

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-35/Layer-3/Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF/</guid>
      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

      <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) provides low overhead and rapid detection of failures in the paths between two network devices. It provides a unified mechanism for link detection over all media and protocol layers. Use BFD to detect failures for IPv4 and IPv6 single or multihop paths between any two network devices, including unidirectional path failure detection.
Cumulus Linux does not support demand mode in BFD.
 Using BFD Multihop Routed Paths BFD multihop sessions are built over arbitrary paths between two systems, which results in some complexity that does not exist for single hop sessions.</description>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-3/Policy-based-Routing/</guid>
      <description>Typical routing systems and protocols forward traffic based on the destination address in the packet, which is used to look up an entry in a routing table. However, sometimes the traffic on your network requires a more hands-on approach. You might need to forward a packet based on the source address, the packet size, or other information in the packet header.
Policy-based routing (PBR) lets you make routing decisions based on filters that change the routing behavior of specific traffic so that you can override the routing table and influence where the traffic goes.</description>

      <description>Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a multicast control plane protocol, that advertises multicast sources and receivers over a routed layer 3 network. Layer 3 multicast relies on PIM to advertise information about multicast capable routers and the location of multicast senders and receivers. For this reason, multicast cannot be sent through a routed network without PIM.
PIM has two modes of operation: Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Dense Mode (PIM-DM).</description>

      <description>Redistribute neighbor provides a mechanism for IP subnets to span racks without forcing the end hosts to run a routing protocol.
The fundamental premise behind redistribute neighbor is to announce individual host /32 routes in the routed fabric. Other hosts on the fabric can then use this new path to access the hosts in the fabric. If multiple equal-cost paths (ECMP) are available, traffic can load balance across the available paths natively.</description>

      <description>Management VRF is a subset of VRF (virtual routing tables and forwarding) and provides a separation between the out-of-band management network and the in-band data plane network. For all VRFs, the main routing table is the default table for all of the data plane switch ports. With management VRF, a second table, mgmt, is used for routing through the Ethernet ports of the switch. The mgmt name is special cased to identify the management VRF from a data plane VRF.</description>

      <description>Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a multicast control plane protocol, that advertises multicast sources and receivers over a routed layer 3 network. Layer 3 multicast relies on PIM to advertise information about multicast capable routers and the location of multicast senders and receivers. For this reason, multicast cannot be sent through a routed network without PIM.
PIM has two modes of operation: Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Dense Mode (PIM-DM).</description>

      <description>Redistribute neighbor provides a mechanism for IP subnets to span racks without forcing the end hosts to run a routing protocol.
The fundamental premise behind redistribute neighbor is to announce individual host /32 routes in the routed fabric. Other hosts on the fabric can then use this new path to access the hosts in the fabric. If multiple equal-cost paths (ECMP) are available, traffic can load balance across the available paths natively.</description>

This is especially useful because Cumulus Linux syncs routes between the kernel and the switching silicon. If the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated.</description>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-343/Layer-Three/Virtual-Routing-and-Forwarding-VRF/</guid>
      <description>Cumulus Linux provides virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch. This permits multiple network paths without the need for multiple switches. Think of this feature as VLAN for layer 3, but unlike VLANs, there is no field in the IP header carrying it. Other implementations call this feature VRF-Lite.
The primary use cases for VRF in a data center are similar to VLANs at layer 2: using common physical infrastructure to carry multiple isolated traffic streams for multi-tenant environments, where these streams are allowed to cross over only at configured boundary points, typically firewalls or IDS.</description>

      <description>Early Access Feature
GRE Tunneling is an early access feature in Cumulus Linux 3.6.
 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that encapsulates network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol network. The two endpoints are identified by the tunnel source and tunnel destination addresses at each endpoint.
GRE packets travel directly between the two endpoints through a virtual tunnel. As a packet comes across other routers, there is no interaction with its payload; the routers only parse the outer IP packet.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks software melds the Linux host world with the networking devices world. Each world comes with its own paradigm on how to upgrade software. Before we discuss the various ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux switches, let&amp;rsquo;s review the general considerations and strategies used to upgrade network devices and Linux hosts.
Upgrades: Comparing the Network Device Worldview vs. the Linux Host Worldview Manual vs. Automated Configuration Historically, network devices were configured in place, and most network devices required customized configurations, which led predominantly to configuring the hardware manually.</description>

      <description>Early Access Feature
netq is an early access feature in Cumulus RMP 3.2. Before you can install netq, you must enable the Early Access repository. For more information about the Cumulus Linux repository, read this knowledge base article.
 netq is a tool for troubleshooting the whole network fabric. Instead of using other tools to troubleshoot node by node, netq aggregates data from across all the nodes in a network, so you can query and diagnose issues affecting the whole network, analyze outages or discover why two or more switches cannot communicate.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks software melds the Linux host world with the networking devices world. Each world comes with its own paradigm on how to upgrade software. Before we discuss the various ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux switches, let&amp;rsquo;s review the general considerations and strategies used to upgrade network devices and Linux hosts.
Upgrades: Comparing the Network Device Worldview vs. the Linux Host Worldview Manual vs. Automated Configuration Historically, network devices were configured in place, and most network devices required customized configurations, which led predominantly to configuring the hardware manually.</description>

      <description>You can use the cl-resource-query command to retrieve information about host entries, MAC entries, layer 2 and layer 3 routes, and ECMP routes that are in use. Because Cumulus Linux synchronizes routes between the kernel and the switching silicon, if the required resource pools in hardware fill up, new kernel routes can cause existing routes to move from being fully allocated to being partially allocated. To avoid this, monitor the routes in the hardware to keep them below the ASIC limits.</description>

The REST API component is an early access feature in Cumulus Linux 3.2.1. Before you can install the API, you must enable the Early Access repository. For more information about the Cumulus Linux repository, read this knowledge base article.
 The Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin is a framework that allows OpenStack Networking to utilize a variety of non-vendor-specific layer 2 networking technologies. The ML2 framework simplifies adding support for new layer 2 networking technologies, requiring much less initial and ongoing effort â€” specifically, it enables dynamic provisioning of VLAN/VXLAN on switches in OpenStack environment instead of manually provisioning L2 connectivity for each VM.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks&amp;rsquo; Routing on the Host provides the ability to run OSPF or BGP directly on server hosts. This can enable a network architecture known as anycast, where many servers can provide the same service without needing layer 2 extensions or load balancer appliances.
Anycast is not a new protocol or protocol implementation and does not require any additional network configuration. Anycast leverages the equal cost multipath (ECMP) capabilities inherent in layer 3 networks to provide stateless load sharing services.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks&amp;rsquo; Routing on the Host provides the ability to run OSPF or BGP directly on server hosts. This can enable a network architecture known as anycast, where many servers can provide the same service without needing layer 2 extensions or load balancer appliances.
Anycast is not a new protocol or protocol implementation and does not require any additional network configuration. Anycast leverages the equal cost multipath (ECMP) capabilities inherent in layer 3 networks to provide stateless load sharing services.</description>

      <description>Early Access Feature
The REST API component is an early access feature in Cumulus Linux 3.3. Before you can install the API, you must enable the Early Access repository. For more information about the Cumulus Linux repository, read this knowledge base article.
 The Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin is a framework that allows OpenStack Networking to utilize a variety of non-vendor-specific layer 2 networking technologies. The ML2 framework simplifies adding support for new layer 2 networking technologies, requiring much less initial and ongoing effort â€” specifically, it enables dynamic provisioning of VLAN/VXLAN on switches in OpenStack environment instead of manually provisioning L2 connectivity for each VM.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks software melds the Linux host world with the networking devices world. Each world comes with its own paradigm on how to upgrade software. Before we discuss the various ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux switches, let&amp;rsquo;s review the general considerations and strategies used to upgrade network devices and Linux hosts.
Upgrades: Comparing the Network Device Worldview vs. the Linux Host Worldview Manual vs. Automated Configuration Historically, network devices were configured in place, and most network devices required customized configurations, which led predominantly to configuring the hardware manually.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux includes native Linux VXLAN kernel support.
Requirements A VXLAN configuration requires a switch with a Trident II chipset running Cumulus Linux 2.0 or later.
For a basic VXLAN configuration, you should ensure that:
 The VXLAN has a network identifier (VNI); do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values under Cumulus Linux.
 The VXLAN link and local interfaces are added to bridge to create the association between port, VLAN and VXLAN instance.</description>

      <description>The Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin is a framework that allows OpenStack Networking to utilize a variety of non-vendor-specific layer 2 networking technologies. The ML2 framework simplifies adding support for new layer 2 networking technologies, requiring much less initial and ongoing effort â€” specifically, it enables dynamic provisioning of VLAN/VXLAN on switches in OpenStack environment instead of manually provisioning L2 connectivity for each VM.
The plugin supports configuration caching. The cached configuration is replayed back to the Cumulus Linux switch from Cumulus ML2 mechanism driver when a switch or process restart is detected.</description>

      <description>RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) provides the ability to write to compute or storage elements using remote direct memory access (RDMA) over an Ethernet network instead of using host CPUs. RoCE relies on congestion control and lossless Ethernet to operate. Cumulus Linux supports features that can enable lossless Ethernet for RoCE environments. Note that while Cumulus Linux can support RoCE environments, the hosts send and receive the RoCE packets.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Networks&amp;rsquo; Host Pack provides the ability to run OSPF or BGP directly on server hosts. This can enable a network architecture known as anycast, where many servers can provide the same service without needing layer 2 extensions or load balancer appliances.
Anycast is not a new protocol or protocol implementation and does not require any additional network configuration. Anycast leverages the equal cost multipath (ECMP) capabilities inherent in layer 3 networks to provide stateless load sharing services.</description>

      <description>Authentication keys can be generated for securely accessing a Cumulus Linux switch with the ssh-keygen component of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. Cumulus Linux uses the OpenSSH package to provide this functionality. The section below covers how to generate a SSH key pair.
Generate an SSH Key Pair  Run the ssh-keygen command, and follow the prompts, to generate the key pair:
**Configure a Passwordless System** To configure a completely passwordless system, do not enter a passphrase when prompted in the following step.</description>

      <description>On Broadcom switches, a MAC address is learned on a bridge regardless of whether or not a received packet is dropped by an ACL. This is due to how the hardware learns MAC addresses and occurs before the ACL lookup. This can be a security or resource problem as the MAC address table has the potential to get filled with bogus MAC addresses, so a malfunctioning host, network error, loop or malicious attack on a shared L2 platform can create an outage for other hosts if the same MAC address is learned on another port.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>Cumulus Linux uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) and Name Service Switch (NSS) for user authentication.
NSS specifies the order of information sources used to resolve names for each service. Using this with authentication and authorization, it provides the order and location used for user lookup and group mapping on the system. PAM handles the interaction between the user and the system, providing login handling, session setup, authentication of users, and authorization of user actions.</description>

      <description>On Broadcom switches, a MAC address is learned on a bridge regardless of whether or not a received packet is dropped by an ACL. This is due to how the hardware learns MAC addresses and occurs before the ACL lookup. This can be a security or resource problem as the MAC address table has the potential to get filled with bogus MAC addresses, so a malfunctioning host, network error, loop or malicious attack on a shared L2 platform can create an outage for other hosts if the same MAC address is learned on another port.</description>

Requirements A VXLAN configuration requires a switch with a Tomahawk, Trident II+ or Trident II chipset running Cumulus Linux 2.0 or later.
For a basic VXLAN configuration, you should ensure that:
 The VXLAN has a network identifier (VNI); do not use 0 or 16777215 as the VNI ID, as they are reserved values under Cumulus Linux.
 The VXLAN link and local interfaces are added to bridge to create the association between port, VLAN and VXLAN instance.</description>

      <description>The Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>The DDOS protection mechanism protects data plane, control plane and management plane traffic in the switch. It drops any packets that match one or more of the following criteria while incurring no performance impact:
 Source IP address matches the destination address for IPv4 and IPv6 packets
 Source MAC address matches the destination MAC address
 Unfragmented or first fragment SYN packets with a source port of 0-1023</description>

      <description>The Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>On Broadcom switches, a MAC address is learned on a bridge regardless of whether or not a received packet is dropped by an ACL. This is due to how the hardware learns MAC addresses and occurs before the ACL lookup. This can be a security or resource problem as the MAC address table has the potential to get filled with bogus MAC addresses, so a malfunctioning host, network error, loop or malicious attack on a shared L2 platform can create an outage for other hosts if the same MAC address is learned on another port.</description>

      <description>The support directory is unique in the fact that it is not a copy of the switch&amp;rsquo;s filesystem. Actually, it is the output from various commands. For example:
   File Equivalent Command Description     support/ip.addr cumulus@switch:~$ ip addr show This shows you all the interfaces (including swp front panel ports), IP address information, admin state and physical state.      </description>

      <description>It is crucial to also protect a switchâ€™s control plane to ensure the proper control plane applications have access to the switchâ€™s CPU. Failure to do so could increase vulnerabilities to a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. Cumulus Linux provides control plane protection by default. It also offers a DDOS protection mechanism, which protects data plane, control plane and management plane traffic in the switch. It drops any packets that match one or more of the following criteria while incurring no performance impact:</description>

      <description>The Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

      <description>sFlow is a monitoring protocol that samples network packets, application operations, and system counters. sFlow collects both interface counters and sampled 5-tuple packet information, enabling you to monitor your network traffic as well as your switch state and performance metrics. An outside server, known as an sFlow collector, is required to collect and analyze this data.
hsflowd is the daemon that samples and sends sFlow data to configured collectors. hsflowd is not included in the base Cumulus Linux installation.</description>

      <guid>docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Layer-2/Ethernet-Bridging-VLANs/VLAN-aware-Bridge-Mode/</guid>
      <description>The Cumulus Linux bridge driver supports two configuration modes, one that is VLAN-aware, and one that follows a more traditional Linux bridge model.
For traditional Linux bridges, the kernel supports VLANs in the form of VLAN subinterfaces. Enabling bridging on multiple VLANs means configuring a bridge for each VLAN and, for each member port on a bridge, creating one or more VLAN subinterfaces out of that port. This mode poses scalability challenges in terms of configuration size as well as boot time and run time state management, when the number of ports times the number of VLANs becomes large.</description>

netq is an early access feature in Cumulus Linux 3.1. Before you can install netq, you must enable the Early Access repository. For more information about the Cumulus Linux repository, read this knowledge base article.
 netq is a tool for troubleshooting the whole network fabric. Instead of using other tools to troubleshoot node by node, netq aggregates data from across all the nodes in a network, so you can query and diagnose issues affecting the whole network, analyze outages or discover why two or more switches cannot communicate.</description>

      <description>The only real unique entity for logging on Cumulus Linux compared to any other Linux distribution is switchd.log, which logs the HAL (hardware abstraction layer) from hardware like the Broadcom or Mellanox ASIC.
This guide on NixCraft is amazing for understanding how /var/log works. The green highlighted rows below are the most important logs and usually looked at first when debugging.

      <description>The ethtool command enables you to query or control the network driver and hardware settings. It takes the device name (like swp1) as an argument. When the device name is the only argument to ethtool, it prints the current settings of the network device. See man ethtool(8) for details. Not all options are currently supported on switch port interfaces.

      <description>Data centers today have a large number of network switches manufactured by different hardware vendors running NOSes (network operating system) from different providers. This chapter provides a set of guidelines for how network port and status LEDs should appear on the front panel of a network switch. This provides a network operator with a standard way to identify the state of a switch and its ports by looking at its front panel, irrespective of the hardware vendor or NOS.</description>
