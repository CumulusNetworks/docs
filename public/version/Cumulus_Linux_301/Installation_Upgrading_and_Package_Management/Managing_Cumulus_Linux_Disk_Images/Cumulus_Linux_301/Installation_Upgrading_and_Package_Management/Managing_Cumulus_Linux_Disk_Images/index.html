<h1>Upgrading Cumulus Linux</h1>

<p>Cumulus Networks software melds the Linux host world with the networking
devices world. Each world comes with its own paradigm on how to upgrade
software. Before we discuss the various ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux
switches, let&rsquo;s review the general considerations and strategies used to
upgrade network devices and Linux hosts.</p>

<h2 id="upgrades-comparing-the-network-device-worldview-vs-the-linux-host-worldview">Upgrades: Comparing the Network Device Worldview vs. the Linux Host Worldview</h2>

<h3 id="manual-vs-automated-configuration">Manual vs. Automated Configuration</h3>

<p>Historically, <em>network devices</em> were configured in place, and most
network devices required customized configurations, which led
predominantly to configuring the hardware manually. A lack of
standardization between vendors, device types, and device roles hampered
the development of APIs and automation tools. However, in the case of
very large data centers, configurations became uniform and repeatable,
and therefore scriptable. Some larger enterprises had to develop their
own custom scripts to roll out data center network configurations.
Virtually no industry-standard provisioning tools existed.</p>

<p>In contrast to data center network devices, <em>Linux hosts</em> in the data
center number in the thousands and tend to have similar configurations.
This increased scale led Linux sysadmins long ago to move to common
tools to automate installation and configuration, since manually
installing and configuring hosts did not work at the scale of a data
center. Nearly all tasks are done via commonly available provisioning
and orchestration tools.</p>

<h3 id="pre-deployment-testing-of-production-environments">Pre-deployment Testing of Production Environments</h3>

<p>Historically, the cost of <em>network device</em> testing has been hampered by
the cost of a single device. Setting up an appropriately sized lab
topology can be very expensive. As a result, it is difficult to do
comprehensive topology-based testing of a release before deploying it.
Thus, many network admins cannot or will not do comprehensive system
testing of a new release before deploying it.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the cost of a <em>Linux host</em> is cheap (or nearly free when
using virtualization), so rigorous testing of a release before deploying
it is not encumbered by budgeting concerns. Most sysadmins extensively
test new releases in the complete application environment.</p>

<h3 id="locations-of-configuration-data-vs-executables">Locations of Configuration Data vs. Executables</h3>

<p><em>Network devices</em> generally separate configuration data from the
executable code. On bootup, the executable code looks into a different
file system and retrieves the configuration file or files, parses the
text and uses that data to configure the software options for each
software subsystem. The model is very centralized, with the executables
generally being packaged together, and the configuration data following
a set of rules that can be read by a centralized parser. Each vendor
controls the configuration format for the entire box, since each vendor
generally supports only their own software. This made sense since the
platform was designed as an application-specific appliance.</p>

<p>Since a <em>Linux host</em> is a general purpose platform, with applications
running on top of it, the locations of the files are much more
distributed. Applications install and read their configuration data from
text files usually stored in the /etc directory tree. Executables are
generally stored in one of several <em>bin</em> directories, but the bin and
etc directories are often on the same physical device. Since each
<em>module</em> (application or executable) was often developed by a different
organization and shared with the world, each module was responsible for
its own configuration data format. Most applications are community
supported, and while there are some generally accepted guiding
principles on how their configuration data is formatted, no central
authority exists to control or ensure compliance.</p>

<h3 id="upgrade-procedure">Upgrade Procedure</h3>

<p>Both network admins and sysadmins generally plan upgrades only to gain
new functionality or to get bug fixes when the workarounds become too
onerous. The goal is to reduce the number of upgrades as much as
possible.</p>

<p>The <em>network device</em> upgrade paradigm is to leave the configuration data
in place, and <em>replace the executable files</em> either all at once from a
single binary image or in large chunks (subsystems). A full release
upgrade comes with risk due to unexpected behavior changes in subsystems
where the admin did not anticipate or need changes.</p>

<p>The <em>Linux host</em> upgrade paradigm is to independently <em>upgrade a small
list of packages</em> while leaving most of the OS untouched. Changing a
small list of packages reduces the risk of unintended consequences.
Usually upgrades are a &ldquo;forward only&rdquo; paradigm, where the sysadmins
generally plan to move to the latest code within the same major release
when needed. Every few years, when a new kernel train is released, a
major upgrade is planned. A major upgrade involves wiping and replacing
the entire OS and migrating configuration data.</p>

<h3 id="rollback-procedure">Rollback Procedure</h3>

<p>Even the most well planned and tested upgrades can result in unforeseen
problems, and sometimes the best solution to new problems is to roll
back to the previous state.</p>

<p>Since <em>network devices</em> clearly separate data and executables, generally
the process is to <em>overwrite the new release executable</em> with the
previously running executable. If the configuration was changed by the
newer release, then you either have to manually back out or repair the
changes, or restore from an already backed up configuration.</p>

<p>The <em>Linux host</em> scenario can be more complicated. There are three main
approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Back out individual packages: If the problematic package is
identified, the sysadmin can downgrade the affected package
directly. In rare cases the configuration files may have to be
restored from backup, or edited to back out any changes that were
automatically made by the upgrade package.</p></li>

<li><p>Flatten and rebuild: If the OS becomes unusable, you can use
orchestration tools to reinstall the previous OS release from
scratch and then automatically rebuild the configuration.</p></li>

<li><p>Backup and restore: Another common strategy is to restore to a
previous state via a backup captured before the upgrade.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="third-party-packages">Third Party Packages</h3>

<p>Third party packages are rare in the <em>network device</em> world. Because the
network OS is usually proprietary, third party packages are usually
packaged by the network device vendor and upgrades of those packages is
handled by the network device upgrade system.</p>

<p>Third party packages in <em>Linux host</em> world often use the same package
system as the distribution into which it is to be installed (for
example, Debian uses <code>apt-get</code>). Or the package may be compiled and
installed by the sysadmin. Configuration and executable files generally
follow the same filesystem hierarchy standards as other applications.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading-cumulus-linux-devices-strategies-and-processes">Upgrading Cumulus Linux Devices: Strategies and Processes</h2>

<p>Because Cumulus Linux is both Linux <em>and</em> a network device, it has
characteristics of both paradigms. The following describes the Cumulus
Linux paradigm with respect to upgrade planning and execution.</p>

<h3 id="automated-configuration-is-preferred-over-manual-configuration">Automated Configuration Is Preferred over Manual Configuration</h3>

<p>Because Cumulus Linux <em>is</em> Linux, Cumulus Networks recommends that even
with small networks or test labs, network admins should make the jump to
deploy, provision, configure, and upgrade switches using automation from
the very beginning. The small up front investment of time spent learning
an orchestration tool, even to provision a small number of Cumulus Linux
devices, will pay back dividends for a long time. The biggest gain is
realized during the upgrade process, where the network admin can quickly
upgrade dozens of devices in a repeatable manner.</p>

<p>Switches, like servers, should be treated like <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cattle+not+pets" target="_blank">cattle, not
pets</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="out-of-band-management-is-worth-the-investment">Out-of-Band Management Is Worth the Investment</h3>

<p>Because network devices are reachable via the IP addresses on the front
panel ports, many network admins of small-to-medium sized networks use
<em>in-band</em> networks to manage their switches. In this design, management
traffic like SSH, SNMP, and console server connections use the same
networks that regular network traffic traverses — there is no separation
between the <em>management plane</em> and the <em>data plane</em>. Larger data centers
create a separate <em>out-of-band</em> network with a completely separate
subnet and reachability path to attach to the management ports — that is
accessible via eth0 and the serial console.</p>

<p>This is a situation where smaller companies should learn from the big
companies. A separate management network isn&rsquo;t free, but it is
relatively cheap. With an inexpensive <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/rmp" target="_blank">Cumulus
RMP</a> management switch, an inexpensive
console server, and a separate cable path, up to 48 devices can be
completely controlled via the out-of-band network in the case of a
network emergency.</p>

<p>There are many scenarios where in-band networking can fail and leave the
network admin waiting for someone to drive to the data center or remote
site to connect directly to the console of a misconfigured or failing
device. The cost of one outage would usually more than pay for the
investment in a separate network. For even more security, attach
remote-controllable power distribution units (PDUs) in each rack to the
management network, so you can have complete control to remote power
cycle every device in that rack.</p>

<h3 id="pre-deployment-testing-of-new-releases-is-advised-and-enabled">Pre-Deployment Testing of New Releases Is Advised and Enabled</h3>

<p>White box switches and virtualization (Cumulus VX) bring the cost of
networking devices down, so the ability for network admins to test their
own procedures, configurations, applications, and network topology in an
appropriately-sized lab topology becomes extremely affordable.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-locations-of-configuration-data-is-required-for-successful-upgrades-migration-and-backup">Understanding the Locations of Configuration Data is Required for Successful Upgrades, Migration, and Backup</h3>

<p>As with other Linux distributions, the <code>/etc</code> directory is the primary
location for all configuration data in Cumulus Linux. The following list
is a likely set of files that should be backed up and migrated to a new
release, but any file that has been changed would need to be examined.
Cumulus Networks recommends you consider making the following files and
directories part of a backup strategy.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-switches-in-an-mlag-pair">Upgrading Switches in an MLAG Pair</h3>

<p>If you have a pair of Cumulus Linux switches as part of an <a href="/Multi-Chassis_Link_Aggregation_-_MLAG.html">MLAG
(multi-chassis link aggregation)
pair</a>, you should only
upgrade each switch when it is in the <em>secondary role</em>. The upgrade path
is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Upgrade Cumulus Linux on the switch already in the secondary role.
This is the switch with the higher <code>clagd-priority</code> value.</p></li>

<li><p>Set the switch in the secondary role into the primary role by
setting its <code>clagd-priority</code> to a value lower than the
<code>clagd-priority</code> setting on the switch in the primary role.</p>

<pre><code>cumulus@switch:~$ sudo clagctl priority VALUE 
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Upgrade the switch that just took on the secondary role.</p></li>

<li><p>Put that switch into the primary role again, if you so choose.</p>

<pre><code>cumulus@switch:~$ sudo clagctl priority VALUE
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>For more information about setting the priority, see <a href="/Multi-Chassis_Link_Aggregation_-_MLAG.html#src-5118344_Multi-ChassisLinkAggregation-MLAG-roles">Understanding
Switch
Roles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading-cumulus-linux-choosing-between-a-binary-install-vs-package-upgrade">Upgrading Cumulus Linux: Choosing between a Binary Install vs. Package Upgrade</h2>

<p>Network admins have two ways to upgrade Cumulus Linux:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Upgrading only the changed packages, using <code>apt-get update</code> and
<code>apt-get upgrade</code>. <strong>This is the preferred method</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p>Performing a binary (full image) install of the new version, using
ONIE. This is used when moving between major versions or if you want
to install a clean image.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to using these methods, which are
outlined below.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-using-package-installs-apt-get-update-apt-get-upgrade">Upgrading Using Package Installs (apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade)</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Configuration data stays in place while the binaries are upgraded.</p></li>

<li><p>Third-party apps stay in place.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This method works only if you are upgrading to a later minor release
(like 3.0.x to 3.1.y) or a later maintenance release (like 3.0.1 to
3.0.2) from an earlier release in the same major release family
<strong>only</strong> (like 2.5.2 to 2.5.5 or 3.0.0 to 3.0.1).</p></li>

<li><p>Rollback is quite difficult and tedious.</p></li>

<li><p>You can&rsquo;t choose the exact release version that you want to run.</p></li>

<li><p>When you upgrade, you upgrade all packages to the latest available
version.</p></li>

<li><p>The upgrade process takes a while to complete, and various switch
functions may be intermittently available during the upgrade.</p></li>

<li><p>Some upgrade operations will terminate SSH sessions on the in-band
(front panel) ports, leaving the user unable to monitor the upgrade
process. As a workaround, use the <a href="https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/215453578" target="_blank">dtach
tool</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Just like the binary install method, you may have to reboot after
the upgrade, lengthening the downtime.</p></li>

<li><p>After you upgrade, user names and group names created by packages
may be different on different switches, depending the configuration
and package installation history.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To upgrade the switch by updating the packages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Back up the configurations off the switch.</p></li>

<li><p>Fetch the latest update meta-data from the repository.</p>

<pre><code>                       
cumulus@switch$ sudo apt-get update
       
        
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Upgrade all the packages to the latest distribution.</p>

<pre><code>                       
cumulus@switch$ sudo apt-get upgrade
       
        
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Reboot the switch if you are notified by the upgrade messages that a
System restart is required.</p>

<pre><code>                       
cumulus@switch$ sudo apt-get upgrade
      ... upgrade messages here ...
 
*** System restart required ***
 
cumulus@switch$ sudo reboot
       
        
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Verify correct operation with the old configurations on new version.</p></li>
</ol>


<div class="notices note" > <p>If you are curious about which packages will be upgraded, use <code>apt-get
upgrade --dry-run</code>. This will display the list of packages that will be
upgraded without upgrading anything.</p>

<div class="notices note" > <p>After you successfully upgrade Cumulus Linux, you may notice some some
results that you may or may not have expected:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>apt-get upgrade</code> always updates the operating system to the most
current version, so if you are currently running Cumulus Linux 3.0.1
and run <code>apt-get upgrade</code> on that switch, the packages will get
upgraded to the latest versions contained in the latest 3.y.z
release.</p></li>

<li><p>When you run <code>cat /etc/image-release</code>, the output still shows the
version of Cumulus Linux from the last binary install. So if you
installed Cumulus Linux 3.0.0 as a full image install and then
upgraded to 3.0.2 using <code>apt-get upgrade</code>, the output from
<code>/etc/image-release</code> still shows: <code>IMAGE_RELEASE=3.0.0</code>. To see the
current version of all the Cumulus Linux packages running on the
switch, use <code>dpkg --list</code> or <code>dpkg -l</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
 </div>


<h3 id="upgrading-via-binary-install-onie">Upgrading via Binary Install (ONIE)</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You choose the exact version that you want to upgrade to.</p></li>

<li><p>This is the only method for upgrading to a new major (X.0) version.
For example, when you are upgrading from 2.5.5 to 3.0.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Configuration data must be moved to the new OS via ZTP while the OS
is first booted, or soon afterwards via out-of-band management.</p></li>

<li><p>Moving the configuration file can go wrong in various ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Identifying all the locations of config data is not always an
easy task. See section above on <a href="/#src-5118269_UpgradingCumulusLinux-UnderstandingLocations">Understanding the Locations of
Configuration
Data</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Config file changes in the new version may cause merge conflicts
that go undetected.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>If config files aren&rsquo;t restored correctly, the user may be unable to
attach to the switch from in-band management. Hence, out-of-band
connectivity (eth0 or console) is recommended.</p></li>

<li><p>The installer takes a while to complete.</p></li>

<li><p>Third-party apps must be reinstalled and reconfigured afterwards.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To upgrade the switch by running a binary install:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Back up the configurations off the switch.</p></li>

<li><p>Install the binary image, following the instructions at <a href="/Installing_a_New_Cumulus_Linux_Image.html">Installing
a New Cumulus Linux
Image</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Restore the configuration files to the new version — ideally via
automation.</p></li>

<li><p>Verify correct operation with the old configurations on the new
version.</p></li>

<li><p>Reinstall third party apps and associated configurations.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rolling-back-a-cumulus-linux-installation">Rolling Back a Cumulus Linux Installation</h2>

<p>Rolling back to an earlier release after upgrading the packages on the
switch follows the same procedure as described for the Linux host OS
rollback above. There are three main strategies, and all require
detailed planning and execution:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Back out individual packages: If the problematic package is
identified, the network admin can downgrade the affected package
directly. In rare cases the configuration files may have to be
restored from backup, or edited to back out any changes that were
automatically made by the upgrade package.</p></li>

<li><p>Flatten and rebuild: If the OS becomes unusable, you can use
orchestration tools to reinstall the previous OS release from
scratch and then automatically rebuild the configuration.</p></li>

<li><p>Backup and restore: Another common strategy is to restore to a
previous state via a backup captured before the upgrade.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Which method you employ is specific to your deployment strategy, so
providing detailed steps for each scenario is outside the scope of this
document.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-package-considerations">Third Party Package Considerations</h2>

<p>Note that if you install any third party apps on a Cumulus Linux switch,
any configuration data will likely be installed into the <code>/etc</code>
directory, but it is not guaranteed. It is the responsibility of the
network admin to understand the behavior and config file information of
any third party packages installed on a Cumulus Linux switch.</p>

<p>After you upgrade the OS using a full binary install, you will need to
reinstall any third party packages or any Cumulus Linux add-on packages,
such as <code>vxsnd</code> or <code>vxrd</code>.</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-upgrade-workflow-in-cumulus-linux-3-0">Installation and Upgrade Workflow in Cumulus Linux 3.0</h2>

<p>Cumulus Linux 3.0 completely embraces the Linux and Debian upgrade
workflow. In this paradigm, a base image is installed using an
installer, then any upgrades within that release train (major version,
like 3.y.z) are done using <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade</code>. Any
packages that have been changed since the base install get upgraded in
place from the repository.</p>

<p>The huge advantage of this approach is that all switch configuration
files remain untouched, or in rare cases merged (using the Debian merge
function) during the package upgrade.</p>

<p>However, when upgrading a switch from a previous release train — for
example, Cumulus Linux 2.5 — a mechanism is required to migrate the
configuration files over to the new 3.0 installation. This is the
perfect opportunity to use automation and orchestration tools to backup
the configuration files, examine them to verify correctness with 3.0,
and then to redeploy the configuration files on the new 3.0
installation.</p>

<h2 id="caveats-when-migrating-configuration-files-between-cumulus-linux-2-5-z-and-3-0">Caveats When Migrating Configuration Files Between Cumulus Linux 2.5.z and 3.0</h2>

<p>Generally, the configuration files in Cumulus Linux 2.5.z should be able
to migrate to version 3.0 without any problems, but there are some known
issues listed below and there may be additional issues with a customer&rsquo;s
particular setup.</p>

<p>Known caveats when migrating files from version 2.x to 3.0:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some configuration files should never be migrated between versions
or while replacing hardware. The <a href="/#src-5118269_UpgradingCumulusLinux-FilesToNeverMigrate">Files that Should Never be
Migrated</a>
table above contains a list of files that should never be migrated.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code> should not be migrated to 3.0
directly. The example below and the ansible script included with
<a href="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/config-backup-upgrade-helper" target="_blank">Config File Migration
Script</a>
explicitly excludes these two files from the backup archive. The
default password for the &lsquo;cumulus&rsquo; user will need to be changed, and
any locally created users should be added to the 3.0 installation
after upgrade.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> must be completely updated with a new 3.0
repository and repository structure. Repositories from Cumulus Linux
2.5 must be removed. If there are any custom repositories on the
switch, they need to be migrated into the 3.0 <code>sources.list</code> file or
the <code>sources.d/</code> directory.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-the-config-file-migration-script-to-identify-and-move-files-to-cumulus-linux-3-0">Using the Config File Migration Script to Identify and Move Files to Cumulus Linux 3.0</h2>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/config-backup-upgrade-helper" target="_blank">Config File Migration
Script</a>
with the <code>--backup</code> option to create a backup archive of configuration
files in version 2.5, copy them off the box, then install them on the
version 3.0 switch. Note that you need to follow the previous section
about caveats when migrating configuration files.</p>


<div class="notices warning" > <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> use the Config File Migration Script to upgrade from
Cumulus Linux 3.0.0 to 3.0.1. Use apt-get instead, as documented in the
<a href="https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/222822047" target="_blank">release
notes</a>.</p>
 </div>


<p>The example provided below excludes <code>/etc/apt</code>, <code>/etc/passwd</code> and
<code>/etc/shadow</code> from the backup archive.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Back up the version 2.5.z files.</p>

<p><strong>Optional:</strong> Use the Ansible playbook included with the <a href="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/config-backup-upgrade-helper" target="_blank">Config
File Migration
script</a>
to automate the backup of all your Cumulus Linux 2.5 switches. See
the section below on <a href="/#src-5118269_UpgradingCumulusLinux-Using_Automation_Tools">Using Automation Tools to Backup
Configurations</a>
for more details.</p>

<pre><code>                       
# Make a temp dir
loc=$(mktemp -d)
# Create a backup archive to the temp dir
sudo ./config_file_changes --backup --backup_dir $loc --exclude /etc/apt,/etc/passwd,/etc/shadow
# Copy the archive and log file to an external server
sudo scp -r $loc/* user@my_external_server:.
       
        
</code></pre></li>

<li><p><a href="/Installing_a_New_Cumulus_Linux_Image.html">Install Cumulus Linux 3.0 onto the switch using
ONIE</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Reinstall the files from the config file archive to the newly
installed 3.0 switch.</p>

<pre><code>                       
# On the switch, copy the config file archive back from the server:
scp user@my_external_server:PATH/SWITCHNAME-config-archive-DATE_TIME.tar.gz .
# Untar the archive to the root of the box
sudo tar -C / -xvf SWITCHNAME-config-archive-DATE_TIME.tar.gz
       
        
</code></pre>


<div class="notices warning" > <pre><code>Be aware that version 2.5.z configurations are not guaranteed to
work in Cumulus Linux 3.0. You should test the restoration and
proper operation of the Cumulus Linux 2.5.z configuration in Cumulus
Linux 3.0 on a non-production switch or in a Cumulus VX image, since
every deployment is unique.
</code></pre>
 </div>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="using-automation-tools-to-back-up-2-5-z-configurations">Using Automation Tools to Back Up 2.5.z Configurations</h2>

<p>Adopting the use of orchestration tools like Ansible, Chef or Puppet for
configuration management greatly increases the speed and accuracy of the
next major upgrade; they also enable the quick swap of failed switch
hardware. Included with the <a href="https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/config-backup-upgrade-helper" target="_blank">Config Migration
Script</a>
is an Ansible playbook that can be used to create a backup archive of
Cumulus Linux 2.5.z switch configuration files and to retrieve them to a
central server — automating step 1 of the previous section for all
deployed Cumulus Linux 2.5.z switches. This is a quick start on the road
to setting up automated configuration and control for your deployment.
For more details on integrating automation into your Cumulus Linux
deployment, see the <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/solutions/automation/" target="_blank">Automation Solutions section on
