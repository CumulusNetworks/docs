      <description>This section covers the process for upgrading NetQ. The upgrade process involves upgrading each of the various components of NetQ (the NetQ Telemetry Server, and both the Host and Cumulus Linux Agents), and then connecting the upgraded NetQ Telemetry Server to the network.
Cumulus Networks recommends only upgrading NetQ during a maintenance window.
 Events generated during the upgrade process will not be available in the database. Once the upgrade process is complete, the agents will re-sync with the current state of the Host or Cumulus Linux switch with the Telemetry server.</description>
