      <description>NetQ presents messages at four levels of severity: Critical, Warning, Info, and Debug. Recommended actions suggest NetQ CLI commands and NCLU commands for further investigation. The following table lists event messages organized by message type and then severity, by default. Click the column header to sort the list by that characteristic. Click
in the column header to toggle the sort order between A-Z and Z-A.
The messages can be viewed in syslog or through third-party notification applications using the NetQ Notifier.</description>

      <description>NetQ provides users with the ability to go back in time to replay the network state, see fabric-wide event change logs and root cause state deviations. The NetQ Telemetry Server maintains data collected by NetQ agents in a time-series database, making fabric-wide events available for analysis. This enables you to replay and analyze network-wide events for better visibility and to correlate patterns. This allows for root-cause analysis and optimization of network configs for the future.</description>

      <description>This topic outlines a few scenarios that illustrate how you use NetQ to troubleshoot MLAG on Cumulus Linux switches. Each starts with a log message that indicates the current MLAG state.
NetQ can monitor many aspects of an MLAG configuration, including:
 Verifying the current state of all nodes
 Verifying the dual connectivity state
 Checking that the peer link is part of the bridge
 Verifying whether MLAG bonds are not bridge members</description>

      <description>There are several tacks you can take to locate and investigate issues that occur in the NeQ software itself, including viewing configuration and log files, verifying NetQ Agent health, and verifying Telemetry Server configuration. If these do not produce a resolution, you can capture a log to use in discussion with Cumulus Networks support team.
Browse Configuration and Log Files To aid in troubleshooting issues with NetQ, there are several configuration and log files on the telemetry server that can provide insight into the root cause of the issue:</description>
