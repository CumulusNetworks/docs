Cumulus Networks recommends only upgrading NetQ during a network maintenance window.
Any data you have collected while using NetQ 2.1.0 is maintained during this upgrade process.
 Events generated during the upgrade process will not be available in the database. Once the upgrade process is complete, the agents re-sync with the current state of the Host or Cumulus Linux switch with the NetQ Platform.</description>
