      <description>You can configure an interface so it can make DHCP relay requests for IPv4 and IPv6.
To run DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6, you need to initiate the DHCP relay and DHCP server twice: once for IPv4 and once for IPv6. Following are the configurations on the host, DHCP relay and DHCP server using the following topology:
For the configurations used in this chapter, both the DHCP server and DHCP relay are switches running Cumulus RMP; however, the DHCP server can also be located on a dedicated switch in your environment.</description>

      <description>The Network Command Line Utility, or NCLU, is a command line interface for Cumulus Networks products, implemented in Cumulus RMP 3.1 and later releases, with the goal of simplifying the networking configuration process for all users.
The NCLU wrapper utility is called net. In 3.1 releases, net is capable of configuring L2 and L3 features of the networking stack, as well as providing monitoring and troubleshooting functionality for these features.</description>
