      Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth Version of the
              Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) using SMIv2

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower [1, 2].

2. The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      RFC 1442 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
      and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
      forthe Internet suite of protocols.

      RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architectural
      aspects of the framework.

      RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to
      managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

3. Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

4. Overview

   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation.

   Apart from a few system-wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into
   three tables: the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute
   Table, and the BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table. The BGP Peer
   Table contains information about state and current activity of
   connections with the BGP peers. The Received Path Attribute Table
   contains path attributes received from all peers running BGP version
   3 or less. The BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table contains path
   attributes received from all BGP-4 peers.  The actual attributes used
   in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute tables
   after local routing policy has been applied.
