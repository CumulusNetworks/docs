1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o RFC 1441 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of
        management.

      o STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
        for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
        architectural aspects of the framework.

      o RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
        access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


1.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

2.  Overview

2.1.  Changes from RFC 1253

   The changes from RFC 1253 are the following:

   (1)  The textual convention PositiveInteger was changed from
        1..'FFFFFFFF'h to 1..'7FFFFFFF'h at the request of
        Marshall Rose.

   (2)  The textual convention TOSType was changed to reflect the
        TOS values defined in the Router Requirements Draft, and
        in accordance with the IP Forwarding Table MIB's values.

   (3)  The names of some objects were changed, conforming to the
        convention that an acronym (for example, LSA) is a single
        word ("Lsa") in most SNMP names.

   (4)  textual changes were made to make the MIB readable by
        Dave Perkins' SMIC MIB Compiler in addition to Mosy.
        This involved changing the case of some characters in
        certain names and removing the DEFVAL clauses for
        Counters.

   (5)  The variables ospfAreaStatus and ospfIfStatus were added,
        having been overlooked in the original MIB.

   (6)  The range of the variable ospfLsdbType was extended to
        include multicastLink (Group-membership LSA) and
        nssaExternalLink (NSSA LSA).

   (7)  The variable ospfIfMetricMetric was renamed
        ospfIfMetricValue, and the following text was removed
        from its description:

        "The value FFFF is distinguished to mean 'no route via



Baker & Coltun              Standards Track                     [Page 3]
 
RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


        this TOS'."

   (8)  The variable ospfNbmaNbrPermanence was added, with the
        values 'dynamic' and 'permanent'; by this means,
        dynamically learned and configured neighbors can be
        distinguished.

   (9)  The DESCRIPTION of the variable ospfNbrIpAddr was changed
        from

        "The IP address of this neighbor."

        to

        "The IP address this neighbor is using in its IP Source
        Address.  Note that, on addressless links, this will not
        be 0.0.0.0, but the address of another of the neighbor's
        interfaces."

        This is by way of clarification and does not change the
        specification.

   (10) The OSPF External Link State Database was added.  The
        OSPF Link State Database used to display all LSAs stored;
        in this MIB, it displays all but the AS External LSAs.
        This is because there are usually a large number of
        External LSAs, and they are relicated in all non-Stub
        Areas.

   (11) The variable ospfAreaSummary was added to control the
        import of summary LSAs into stub areas.  If it is
        noAreaSummary (default) the router will neither originate
        nor propagate summary LSAs into the stub area.  It will
        rely entirely on its default route.  If it is
        sendAreaSummary, the router will both summarize and
        propagate summary LSAs.

   (12) The general variables ospfExtLsdbLimit and
        ExitOverflowInterval were introduced to help handle LSDB
        overflow.

   (13) The use of the IP Forwarding Table is defined.

   (14) The ospfAreaRangeTable was obsoleted and replaced with
        the ospfAreaAggregateTable to accommodate two additional
        indexes.  The ospfAreaAggregateEntry keys now include a
        LsdbType (which can be used to differentiate between the
        traditional type-3 Aggregates and NSSA Aggregates) and an



Baker & Coltun              Standards Track                     [Page 4]
 
RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


        ospfAreaAggregateMask (which will more clearly express
        the range).

   (15) The variable ospfAreaAggregateEffect was added.  This
        permits the network manager to hide a subnet within an
        area.

   (16) Normally, the border router of a stub area advertises a
        default route as an OSPF network summary.  An NSSA border
        router will generate a type-7 LSA indicating a default
        route, and import it into the NSSA.  ospfStubMetricType
        (ospf internal, type 1 external, or type 2 external)
        indicates the type of the default metric advertised.

   (17) ospfMulticastExtensions is added to the OSPF General
        Group.  This indicates the router's ability to forward IP
        multicast (Class D) datagrams.

   (18) ospfIfMulticastForwarding is added to the Interface
        Group.  It indicates whether, and if so, how, multicasts
        should be forwarded on the interface.

   (19) The MIB is converted to SNMP Version 2.  Beyond simple
        text changes and the addition of the MODULE-IDENTITY and
        MODULE-COMPLIANCE macros, this involved trading the
        TruthValue Textual Convention for SNMP Version 2's, which
        has the same values, and trading the Validation Textual
        Convention for SNMP Version 2's RowStatus.

   (20) ospfAuthType (area authentication type) was changed to an
        interface authentication type to match the key.  It also
        has an additional value, to indicate the use of MD5 for
        authentication.

   (21) ospfIfIntfType has a new value, pointToMultipoint.

   (22) ospfIfDemand (read/write) is added, to permit control of
        Demand OSPF features.

   (23) ospfNbrHelloSuppressed and ospfVirtNbrHelloSuppressed
        were added, (read only). They indicate whether Hellos are
        being suppressed to the neighbor.

   (24) ospfDemandExtensions was added to indicate whether the
        Demand OSPF extensions have been implemented, and to
        disable them if appropriate.

2.2.  Textual Conventions

   Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this
   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of
   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications
   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the
   these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

   The new data types are AreaID, RouterID, TOSType, Metric, BigMetric,
   Status, PositiveInteger, HelloRange, UpToMaxAge, InterfaceIndex, and
   DesignatedRouterPriority.

2.3.  Structure of MIB

   The MIB is composed of the following sections:

     General Variables
     Area Data Structure
     Area Stub Metric Table
     Link State Database
     Address Range Table
     Host Table
     Interface Table
     Interface Metric Table
     Virtual Interface Table
     Neighbor Table
     Virtual Neighbor Table
     External Link State Database
     Aggregate Range Table

   There exists a separate MIB for notifications ("traps"), which is
   entirely optional.

2.3.1.  General Variables

   The General Variables are about what they sound like; variables which
   are global to the OSPF Process.







Baker & Coltun              Standards Track                     [Page 6]
 
RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


2.3.2.  Area Data Structure and Area Stub Metric Table

   The Area Data Structure describes the OSPF Areas that the router
   participates in.  The Area Stub Metric Table describes the metrics
   advertised into a stub area by the default router(s).

2.3.3.  Link State Database and External Link State Database

   The Link State Database is provided primarily to provide detailed
   information for network debugging.

2.3.4.  Address Table and Host Tables

   The Address Range Table and Host Table are provided to view
   configured Network Summary and Host Route information.

2.3.5.  Interface and Interface Metric Tables

   The Interface Table and the Interface Metric Table together describe
   the various IP interfaces to OSPF.  The metrics are placed in
   separate tables in order to simplify dealing with multiple types of
   service, and to provide flexibility in the event that the IP TOS
   definition is changed in the future.  A Default Value specification
   is supplied for the TOS 0 (default) metric.

2.3.6.  Virtual Interface Table

   Likewise, the Virtual Interface Table describe virtual links to the
   OSPF Process.

2.3.7.  Neighbor and Virtual Neighbor Tables

   The Neighbor Table and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the
   neighbors to the OSPF Process.

2.4.  Conceptual Row Creation

   For the benefit of row-creation in "conceptual" (see [9]) tables,
   DEFVAL (Default Value) clauses are included in the definitions in
   section 3, suggesting values which an agent should use for instances
   of variables which need to be created due to a Set-Request, but which
   are not specified in the Set-Request.  DEFVAL clauses have not been
   specified for some objects which are read-only, implying that they
   are zeroed upon row creation.  These objects are of the SYNTAX
   Counter32 or Gauge32.

   For those objects not having a DEFVAL clause, both management
   stations and agents should heed the Robustness Principle of the



Baker & Coltun              Standards Track                     [Page 7]
 
RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


   Internet (see RFC-791):

     "be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you
     send"

   That is, management stations should include as many of these columnar
   objects as possible (e.g., all read-write objects) in a Set-Request
   when creating a conceptual row; agents should accept a Set-Request
   with as few of these as they need (e.g., the minimum contents of a
   row creating SET consists of those objects for which, as they cannot
   be intuited, no default is specified.).

   There are numerous read-write objects in this MIB, as it is designed
   for SNMP management of the protocol, not just SNMP monitoring of its
   state.  However, in the absence of a standard SNMP Security
   architecture, it is acceptable for implementations to implement these
   as read-only with an alternative interface for their modification.

2.5.  Default Configuration

   OSPF is a powerful routing protocol, equipped with features to handle
   virtually any configuration requirement that might reasonably be
   found within an Autonomous System.  With this power comes a fair
   degree of complexity, which the sheer number of objects in the MIB
   will attest to.  Care has therefore been taken, in constructing this
   MIB, to define default values for virtually every object, to minimize
   the amount of parameterization required in the typical case.  That
   default configuration is as follows:

   Given the following assumptions:

   -    IP has already been configured

   -    The ifTable has already been configured

   -    ifSpeed is estimated by the interface drivers

   -    The OSPF Process automatically discovers all IP
        Interfaces and creates corresponding OSPF Interfaces

   -    The TOS 0 metrics are autonomously derived from ifSpeed

   -    The OSPF Process automatically creates the Areas required
        for the Interfaces

   The simplest configuration of an OSPF process requires that:

   -    The OSPF Process be Enabled.



Baker & Coltun              Standards Track                     [Page 8]
 
RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


   This can be accomplished with a single SET:

                  ospfAdminStat := enabled.

   The configured system will have the following attributes:

   -    The RouterID will be one of the IP addresses of the
        device

   -    The device will be neither an Area Border Router nor an
        Autonomous System Border Router.

   -    Every IP Interface, with or without an address, will be
        an OSPF Interface.

   -    The AreaID of each interface will be 0.0.0.0, the
        Backbone.

   -    Authentication will be disabled

   -    All Broadcast and Point to Point interfaces will be
        operational.  NBMA Interfaces require the configuration
        of at least one neighbor.

   -    Timers on all direct interfaces will be:

          Hello Interval:        10 seconds
          Dead Timeout:          40 Seconds
          Retransmission:         5 Seconds
          Transit Delay:          1 Second
          Poll Interval:        120 Seconds

   -    no direct links to hosts will be configured.

   -    no addresses will be summarized

   -    Metrics, being a measure of bit duration, are unambiguous
        and intelligent.

   -    No Virtual Links will be configured.

4.  OSPF Traps

   OSPF is an event driven routing protocol, where an event can be a
   change in an OSPF interface's link-level status, the expiration of an
   OSPF timer or the reception of an OSPF protocol packet.  Many of the
   actions that OSPF takes as a result of these events will result in a
   change of the routing topology.  As routing topologies become large
   and complex it is often difficult to locate the source of a topology
   change or unpredicted routing path by polling a large number or
   routers.  Another approach is to notify a network manager of
   potentially critical OSPF events with SNMP traps.



Baker & Coltun              Standards Track                    [Page 66]
 
RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


   This section defines a set of traps, objects and mechanisms to
   enhance the ability to manage IP internetworks which use OSPF as its
   IGP.  It is an optional but useful extension to the OSPF MIB.

4.1.  Format Of Trap Definitions

   Section 7 contains contains the trap definitions.

4.2.  Approach

   The mechanism for sending traps is straight-forward.  When an
   exception event occurs, the application notifies the local agent who
   sends a trap to the appropriate SNMP management stations.  The
   message includes the trap type and may include a list of trap
   specific variables.  A new object is defined in section 3.2 that will
   allow a network manager to enable or disable particular OSPF traps.
   Section 5 gives the trap definitions which includes the variable
   lists.  The router ID of the originator of the trap is included in
   the variable list so that the network manager may easily determine
   the source of the trap.

   To limit the frequency of OSPF traps, the following additional
   mechanisms are suggested.

4.3.  Ignoring Initial Activity

   The majority of critical events occur when OSPF is enabled on a
   router, at which time the designated router is elected and neighbor
   adjacencies are formed.  During this initial period a potential flood
   of traps is unnecessary since the events are expected.  To avoid
   unnecessary traps, a router should not originate expected OSPF
   interface related traps until two of that interface's dead timer
   intervals have elapsed.  The expected OSPF interface traps are
   ospfIfStateChange, ospfVirtIfStateChange, ospfNbrStateChange,
   ospfVirtNbrStateChange, ospfTxRetranmit and ospfVirtIfTxRetransmit.
   Additionally, ospfMaxAgeLsa and ospfOriginateLsa traps should not be
   originated until two dead timer intervals have elapsed where the dead
   timer interval used should be the dead timer with the smallest value.

4.4.  Throttling Traps

   The mechanism for throttling the traps is similar to the mechanism
   explained in RFC 1224 [11], section 5.  The basic idea is that there
   is a sliding window in seconds and an upper bound on the number of
   traps that may be generated within this window.  Unlike RFC 1224,
   traps are not sent to inform the network manager that the throttling
   mechanism has kicked in.




Baker & Coltun              Standards Track                    [Page 67]
 
RFC 1850                        OSPF MIB                   November 1995


   A single window should be used to throttle all OSPF traps types
   except for the ospfLsdbOverflow and the ospfLsdbApproachingOverflow
   trap which should not be throttled.  For example, if the window time
   is 3, the upper bound is 3 and the events that would cause trap types
   1,3,5 and 7 occur within a 3 second period, the type 7 trap should
   not be generated.

   Appropriate values are 7 traps with a window time of 10 seconds.

4.5.  One Trap Per OSPF Event

   Several of the traps defined in section 5 are generated as the result
   of finding an unusual condition while parsing an OSPF packet or a
   processing a timer event.  There may be more than one unusual
   condition detected while handling the event.  For example, a link-
   state update packet may contain several retransmitted link-state
   advertisements (LSAs), or a retransmitted database description packet
   may contain several database description entries.  To limit the
   number of traps and variables, OSPF should generate at most one trap
   per OSPF event.  Only the variables associated with the first unusual
   condition should be included with the trap.  Similarly, if more than
   one type of unusual condition is encountered while parsing the
   packet, only the first event will generate a trap.

4.6.  Polling Event Counters

   Many of the tables in the OSPF MIB contain generalized event
   counters.  By enabling the traps defined in this document a network
   manager can obtain more specific information about these events.  A
   network manager may want to poll these event counters and enable
   specific OSPF traps when a particular counter starts increasing
   abnormally.

   The following table shows the relationship between the event counters
   defined in the OSPF MIB and the trap types defined in section 5.
