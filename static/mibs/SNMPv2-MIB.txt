Abstract

   This document defines managed objects which describe the behavior of
   a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) entity.  This document
   obsoletes RFC 1907, Management Information Base for Version 2 of the
   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2).

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects which
   describe the behavior of an SNMP entity, as defined in the SNMP
   architecture STD 62, [RFC3411].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

               This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for
               each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node
               performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added
               to the sum.  For example, a node which performs only
               routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).
               In contrast, a node which is a host offering application
               services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).
               Note that in the context of the Internet suite of

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change) the objects in this MIB.






Presuhn, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 22]

RFC 3418                      MIB for SNMP                 December 2002


   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the
   View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is
   recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change)
   them.
