<p>The default hostname for the NetQ Virtual Machines is <em>ubuntu</em>. Change the hostname to fit your naming conventions while meeting Internet and Kubernetes naming standards.</p>

<p>Kubernetes requires that hostnames are composed of a sequence of labels concatenated with dots. For example, “en.wikipedia.org” is a hostname. Each label must be from 1 to 63 characters long. The entire hostname, including the delimiting dots, has a maximum of 253 ASCII characters.</p>

<p>The Internet standards (RFCs) for protocols specify that labels may contain only the ASCII letters a through z (in lower case), the digits 0 through 9, and the hyphen-minus character ('-').</p>

<p>Use the following command:</p>

<pre>cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname NEW_HOSTNAME</pre>

<p>Add the same NEW_HOSTNAME value to <b>/etc/hosts</b> on your VM for the localhost entry. Example:</p>
    
<pre>127.0.0.1 localhost NEW_HOSTNAME</pre>
