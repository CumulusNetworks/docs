<p>In the topology, <strong>leaf01</strong> and <strong>leaf02</strong> are the access layer switches on the network. <strong>leaf01</strong> and <strong>leaf02</strong> connect to <strong>spine01</strong>, which is the aggregation layer switch on the network. To facilitate additional configuration after the initial setup descibed in this guide, leaf01 and leaf02 also have two connections to each other.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create three VMs (leaf01, leaf02, and spine01) and the network connections between them</li>
<li>Log in to the switches</li>
<li>Perform basic switch configuration</li>
<li>Verify configuration</li>


</ul>
