You can update your virtual environment to be able to use the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/linux-on-demand/">Cumulus Linux on-demand</a> self-paced labs (a quick and easy way to learn the fundamentals). You can also run the <a href="{{ printf "%s#run-the-topology-converter" ("cumulus-vx/Advanced-Configuration" | absURL) }}"> topology converter</a> to simulate a custom network topology with VirtualBox and Vagrant, or KVM-QEMU and Vagrant.</li>
<li>Try <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-switching/air/">NVIDIA Air</a>, which is a free, personal, virtual data center network that provides a low-effort way to see Cumulus Networks technology in action. This is a good way to try out Cumulus Linux if you have platform or disk limitations. </li>
